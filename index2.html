		<div class="paragraph"> look at this like okay now we know something can happen that we never talked to happen for the whole world shuts down now we know that's it we should we should act accordingly in like how we run things now we know what that's a silver lining I mean like that's a silver line it's like when you have a thing happened that you realized like you know whatever like in your car you get lucky and you notice that the tire is like super flat and you feel you fill it up whatever you see thing and it saves you from a later f****** thing they could have been a million times worse but you know man the wake-up call to me is like it's no joke that you need to at least be on like some terms of your neighbors and it's no joke that you need to understand how to do like how to grow food out of the ground and it seemed like basic first aid and stuff like that and I always have gas in your car trees in like f****** the Vino left a credit card at the house right in like the car was kind of low on fuel cuz I didn't gas it up like I should have right and no combination of settling not being able to put gas in the car and he's too dumb mistakes it wasn't just a normal shity day where your car I got a gas now it's your cars run out of gas during a pandemic meaning you got to call somebody to come and get put gas in your car or walk somewhere to get gas at the whole different Denver for not asking someone to come and help you it's kind of like asking to me would you mind like taking a chance and I know you're wearing a mask and everything but you know what I mean so suddenly f*** ups in this kind of environment they mean a lot more than f****** in like the previous world that we are in and that's teaching me a real kind of responsibility you know like having some cash on it like stuff like that I hate using every season with turn Silver Lining right now and it's like anytime you say I saw you at the Silver Lining on the people who drown in their own f****** mucus it's not the few know it's f***** up but I guess one of the Silver Linings in it is just that the fact that it's like look man Trump just was talking about maybe we should inject ourselves with a Lysol okay Yeah Yeah Yeahs tweeted it when you look into the abyss the abyss looks into you release date of an entire planet that it might be a good idea to inject Lysol in your body's here at let's hear my computer I had to get the sound out of it nothing anyway bottom line is he's saying wacky s*** in the focuses on this lady and now she's watching him she's like I can't even f****** believe I have to handle this I don't know how you doing there you go cuz you see a thing like that and it's like okay lean into that like that's going to fly Queen into that is a thing that you can count on that's a thing saying inject Lysol that's the kind of thing where you're crazy as friend if they said that to you you wouldn't be considering like calling their of their friends their mom to be like hey Jackie's having like a hardcore manic episode he's talking about injecting Lysol I knew himself you better do something that's a f****** president and it mean what that tells me is like Parker you need gas in your car you need to make sure your phone is do stuff you know whatever you need to make sure that you are like you got to be ready because if if we like think we're going to lean into some like imaginary hammock made of like people Doterra saying that we should inject yourself with Lysol then wormate then it's our fault cuz you know it's like let's say you went and you I don't know you went into the forest and you got attacked by a tiger but right before you went in the Tiger use the force you said to somebody hate you think I should go in that fourth or Tigers down there like no and then they start shooting up with Lysol you know what I mean if you go in that Forest that's your fault you f****** listen to a dude you thought you could shoot up Lysol you know what I mean that's your fault intelligent way to get out of this f****** subject and I've already started and I've already coming up with perhaps for instance maybe you could maybe you could hit somebody with a tremendous whether it's ultraviolet or just very powerful light and I think you had fun some of the way and I think you said you going to test that to sounds interesting right and then I see the disinfectant with knocks it out in a minute 1 minute and is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or or almost deplaning cuz you see gets in the lungs and volume down put your lungs to a carwash like what what a crazy thing to say I mean cleaning cleaning give him a cleaning you know soap to me you see that and it's like okay well I'm not quite certain that that is where I'm going to get my data stream from because that's a Lysol person and then but then we but then there must be like a thing we can do regardless of the fact that clearly you wouldn't even talk like that on a podcast imagine you have zero expertise in a certain subject to talking to someone is like some expert in this said subject and you're proposing these outlandish like you're at a Podium you don't even have a private conversation in front everybody you're someone to have an aside conversation we are proposing these ridiculous ideas you can't do that you can inject this infection he probably upset and she wants to do the best work that she can do and this is just some nonsense just to handle along the way a lot of things might be able to be done and maybe you could do a strong ultraviolet light like in the skin that is like oh my God I'm laying out possible ways that you could tear this terrible to keep going I better have more than one yeah for support like I think you said maybe I think you said maybe looking at that yeah man I mean it definitely has that sense like when you had to give her a report at school and you hadn't prepared.</div>

alright so that and the Bry activity that and then bribed the rest of it sure you know you're you're getting a picture taken of you to try to get you into the school that your dad went through or whatever you're complicit to some degree like you have to be a little bit good luck stop go up look at that that's a grey sweater grey t-shirt grey t-shirts it's really f*****-up is like there's some kid whose parents like like you're making 20K a year who's working as f****** ass off you know I just like somehow managing do I study non-stop to try to get into a good school and doesn't get into the school cuz of that s*** that's the that's the satanic part is like they buy their way in and that's someone's place they have a limited number of places meaning like theoretically somewhat doesn't get into the school who could be the person teleportation or some s*** schools are you have your first choice second choice 1/2 Billy custard Choice yeah he's going on where's it going South Dakota Illuminati with an embarrassing and if you don't know how I talk around my friends what if that's how it is with like Illuminati to like these kids don't even know their parents were the Illuminati

		<div class="paragraph"> I'm not like a paranoid person but I'll tell you a joke you got me to leave my house for the first time in five weeks since I don't have you left and I'm so happy I tested the first time in five weeks that I've left the house and yeah Airsoft but no great to be here thank you my pleasure and I haven't I haven't left my house in 5 weeks I've been isolating as a responsible Citizen and excited to be here okay at this point in my life there you go right before this happened and I kind of think of myself sometimes I think okay imagine if I had been in a relationship that hadn't been going well and this happened and then you have to make the decision to isolate with somebody I'm not in that situation I'm home alone and I've been talking a lot to my friends on FaceTime and I've been socializing and I've been you know living life in this world but alone in my house I'm going through my computer's started going through old footage I found that clip from when you came up to my house back in the day and now I just saw this moment were in the clip where we started talking about my old web show and you come up to my house back in the day and it was so cool that you came up then and remember the time your website was like way advance write like it had all sorts of extra stuff on it that people weren't really doing on the web back then and you came up we start talking about the web and that was because of my webmaster Andrew Blevins shout out to Andrew Webb creating talking about what we got to do prophetic moment how can we make money off of it now we're here in this beautiful Studio really planted a seed in my head to do something like this online this yours was a big one got done at your house and seen how you had servers is not a sophisticated service provider set up at your house like you could have run like a network in 2007 the whole rack set like it was much more like a sad than anything I've ever seen before outside of a set it would light screwed into those ceiling I kind of trashed my place even figured out how to take video calls from people that was exciting then I guess you and that's that was a bad Corner my living room there to Genie delete all the wires going up to that that's going up into the ceiling. Through the ceiling into the spare room which I turned into the editing room I forget what models is Sony's Witcher so you started with a tricaster and Mister system first I had that for a year then we got this the first person to tricaster that's Victor who was working on the show until you stuck that I'm here today I still talk to Victor quite a bit to shout out today but but still kind of legit oh my God cuz Anthony cumia had a kind of a pretty high-tech set up in his basement that was another inspiration cuz he was doing that while he was doing Opie and Anthony and you know they actually is important I'm wanted him to stop doing it they decided something or another it's not he shouldn't be allowed to do an extra show karaoke with machine guns in front of green screen haha he was always really funny and just like like a comic but he never did stand up I mean I'm just making this up right now but I think sometimes people that have never done stand-up who do radio or afraid of it because and that went out and it was defining what's happened in our world you were just saying you know like what we do we don't need the advertisers anyway we do you need the Network's anymore we don't know we can cattle go straight to the advertiser that video available anywhere I think I saw it on the internet about how this internet stuff is played out since then so I remember I got a call this is one of those like you know when you think about syncback user kick yourself I was so I mean how far in the weeds the guys from Denver is San Francisco San Francisco and Barrett Lions did he do some stuff with some guys from Denver that was that was sort of around the same time they were that was Mania TV but TV was the only people that were really doing live streaming and I said hey you know like I want to build this TV studio and the studio but I wanted to I wanted to be autonomous of them as well so I got my own servers through this company bit gravity where they basically invented the technology to upload video and then serve it up so I would link that to my website on green.com completely autonomous of the other website Mania TV so made a few mistakes all the stuff to be on my website and then YouTube started now what's this will YouTube all the school they're still doing things out of an apartment in Sanford on the member one point somebody called me from YouTube said hey man we really like what you're doing be on your server right so you have those fuse not thinking okay we could have it out spread it send it out but it was it was exciting everybody thought that ya done now it's like comparing two of them because all those other video things it's like yeah you'll get some views but it's just YouTube for whatever reason captured the day I have the market could never became my space you with your phone or camera development you can upload it like real simple anybody can do it and then anybody else I can get views like that is amazing that one company has that locked up in technology and they got the fun to be able to stay right on top of it just make it the strongest platform possibly I don't know I don't even Twitter like how they do that just like one Twitter I mean there's Facebook on Instagram but if I if I go to your page and I'm reading one of your caption someone will say something in response to someone that like a f*** you dick boy or whatever and then I try to click and find out what they were talking about and someone will say something in response to someone that like a f*** you dick boy or whatever and then I try to click and find out what they were talking about and I get to the beginning of the comments and then I got to go through all the comments to try to figure this out like why can't I just click</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> and you start thinking about all the possibilities what could happen and then this Panda happens and then you know I still live in the same place where did the show you know I just started seeing you know I'm here in Los Angeles to I was seeing Black Hawk helicopter Apache helicopter do you know I haven't watched it let me know it's crazy Walking Dead Seasons Ross hear about it now but maybe even better is the first season of the LA version of Walking Dead what's that one called couple episodes of spectacular felt like is that what time the beginning the beginning in the beginning it felt touch-and-go when everybody was hoarding all the tooth to toilet paper and I were fighting a gun the gun lines were giant Rife gun stores were creepy maybe it's not obvious enough so toilet papers big ass so because it's big takes up a lot of shelf space who takes up a lot of space so everybody went to the grocery store at the same time and there's probably far less toilet paper at the grocery store then it would appear too because it takes an entire Royal cuz it's big so everybody want but one piece of package of toilet paper on the first day he was instantly all it's instantly an entire empty aisle which is dramatic looking and it was the first sign of shelves being cleared and it was the toilet paper was gone and everyone went on their f****** phone toilet paper and all of a sudden. Compounded it exponentially and I was going to the toilet paper they don't need to be gone for the toilet paper and we had the great toilet paper shortage of 20/20 this is the type of investigative reporting you do when you're alone for five weeks Columbo toilet paper cuz it's big dumb people think about a lot of shiting write wash your ass with a washcloth back because s*** is going down alrighty that's the last thing you need to worry about is my toilet paper you need to worry about consuming food and staying alive don't think it's ever going to get to that and those the ones that stock up on toilet paper the ones who buy like rice and beans and stuff like that those the people that are planning their legitimately planning ahead you want to stay a lot corn and rice that's what I was a subsystem enough vitamins and everything you need so you don't get enough protein that way but you get some from being overly not as available sun is bioavailable as it is in other Foods so protein you just going to eat a lot of protein vitamins and everything you need so I'm sure you don't get enough protein that way but you get some from being overly not as available bioavailable as it is in other Foods so protein you just going to eat a lot complete some forms of protein</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> watch the movie about the free free free climbing movie that's playing on the plane but the guy that climbed Alex Honnold besides like I said earlier we're going to make pants I want to make tents I'm going to climb that you get to meet so many people like that yeah that must be fun well it's it's very important for me as a person trying to figure people out is to be able to see this insane spectrum of exceptional people right to see some like Alex Honnold has a really fascinating guy very fast really smart is really to India and he's really mellow he's got hands like saucing ass right you realize he didn't bring his chalk with him so he found some other climbers that were on their way out there were on ropes and said hey do you think I can borrow some chalk and they gay I have an extra bag here take it so he's f****** thousand feet up just hang it on finding other people were connected to the ropes with and they give him a bag of cherries over he leaves at the top of the mountain cuz he passes that cuz he's in he's not your man don't show me on freaked out food bro. Down to that wow holy s*** dude f*** all that look I know it's together with a group of people and I'd always said I'm never going to jump out of an airplane that was always my thing parachuting because we drove out there together group of people and I realized on the drive that I was the only person that wasn't coming out the airplane OG's and for whatever reason my competitive spirit that the best of me I said there's no way I'm going to be the one that didn't jump out of the airplane on the way back so we suited up and I just in that movie Charlie's Angels okay and there's a lot of parachuting in it and the stunt coordinators from that movie were taking the cast out to jump out if they wanted to so I went and Jared Leto was there you know my friends were there and I did and I didn't regret it but I'll never do it again it was amazing it was exciting you're you're strapped onto a guy doesn't your back right doesn't your body is getting a lot further away and then you're now the weirdest part about it was 20 years ago now but or 18 or whatever that you're now you're doing this right and you kind of realized control because there's another guy over there he's kind of far away and all sudden like you lean into it and you fly up to him like Superman this far away is far away I don't know what a papist you looking at each other and it's amazing and exciting and then nothing was weird about this then you pull the Chute or the guy on your back both the shoot and now you're hanging from ropes and you would be the time where it's you can relax but to me the one time I've done it talking about parachuting like I know about it the one time I've done at 18 years ago that's the scariest moment that the only thing preventing you in your face looking at your feet now you're looking at your feet hanging below you and your feelings ropes you're holding on holding the ropes gun these ropes gift like nothing nothing but amazing experience will never do it again surprised you haven't I think you got a contact high song there's no reason for that I think you would I think you would if I lived yeah yeah I'm pretty yeah I get it I get it but I don't I don't think I need that my life now I don't that's what I always said to where you end up going out to parachuting thing with a bunch of people unless you know here in a relationship and the person when you going to be that the chickenshit you got to do what you got to do save face ya almost. One of those things that you kind of you do it and you think I'm going to be okay and then one time maybe you're not and that's all it takes one of red bands dad his friend worked with a lady was little it was really in the sky diamond she's always trying to get him to do it and then one day he showed up at work and she wasn't at her desk and so what happened last night all that f*** all that dude</div>

These guys race runways out here now that's like the thing now is run Runway racing so they go out and they go side-by-side half-mile they're doing like to 2230 and 1/2 Mile would fly through the Air Jordan Fly you would drive the number being more than normal car that doesn't fly yeah I would drive something then by the way after that they changed the they read sculpted that section of track Brianna yes they for a. Of time Shane they impose the speed limit even during races through that section to prevent that from happening again they changed I believe the rules of the racing series to unload the cars down and then I believe they re did the track there is well after that incident like that or at least to make it substantially less likely scary crazy place at every every reputation that it every bit of reputations are ended it deserves and it's but you going to doing it is like one of the more unique experience of your life and you don't have to like you know like you said you have to go for time you can just go and drive it as a fast fun road which is what I've done as Americans we should be ashamed that the Germans have the Nurburgring Amelia but it was a Hitler it was a fourth Reich superiority thing right alongside the Autobahn best race tracks best race cars best highways as part of their deal and it is how to figure out speed people run speed and they're giving it to the pilot at a speed probably was doing speedballs like f****** John Belushi I mean it was it was crazy and yeah yeah yeah submarine base leaders of floating coffin and they sent these people out with like 10 tablets of meth and nothing else and this little submarine that had a little gun in like none of them came back just can't. That I have sympathy for Nazis but messed up soldiers and death submarines maybe a little bit is that what it was that little thing oh my God yeah, it's the picture I saw had the bubble somewhere in Columbia is a dude with a thousand pounds of Coke in one of those right now that a great idea anyway knocking on the bed early do they open up the jumped on top of a goddamn submarine and made the guys open the pulse open the sub bro it is Bonkers a submarine holyshit looking this 25 footlong sub so these guys are following behind it and he jumps off we was bad motherfuker so we do you think you think this sub is capable of fulsome urging or this is the closest to sublet it gets stops and filling them up with Cocoa FL in that made any way to another country in that big ship in Philadelphia that cargo ship that was supposed on by Chase but I had 200 or 400 million dollars worth of cocaine really Paris to Dakar Rally is the car race like cars like my Safari or like built for that and it's Grace and then there's these support trucks right and they they race the trucks to since like he's like, pause and like man trucks big off road tires huge engines and the trucks are in the race and so these Coke Smugglers that the trucks the bat in the back of the truck is enough parts to like rebuild the whole car and the truck has a racing driver and a v mechanic screw and they chase the car at the car brakes right and so Smuggler's bought one of these Dakar race trucks did it up like The Livery and just like couple miles after the start just like enter the race 13000 pounds I'm sorry it's like seven and a half times that is crazy and 37 Bales million pounds worth escape the built the sub Ray Liotta and Kevin Dillon invention No Escape with her on the prison Island they get the</div>

I'm all your babies I'm all your baby that is very kind of you to say I'm sitting here on your incredible show with everybody is riveted by your show when you say something it matters which is different than when you do a show on your audio podcast now I got a few people listening but it's not like it doesn't matter right that's responsibilities out but you're when you say something here it will affect the entire Society you have people now who don't believe in the stay home order there but they should until the actual scientific experts that they should go out but here's the thing who are the experts and are they different in different states and I think that's one of the benefits of having 50 states when I'm talking about the different styles of living Arizona lets you have a gun just carried on your hip right you can't do that in San Francisco right this different styles of living let's find out what different styles are right way to reopen the world we know the world got to be reopened okay we're not going to just stay Oscar winning run out of food I have to do things so do we have to do things after the vaccinations and can our society survive that do not many people are committing suicide right now my Suicide a week now they're doing a day this is something that needs to be factored in the drop in the economy equivalent to a loss of a certain number of lives and that every time the economy drops a certain percentage equal to x amount of life we might get to a place where it's conceivable that more lives are lost because of the ensuing depression and economic shutdown then we would have been lost if we didn't open up we didn't close anything and we just let everybody get sick it's a complicated thing and this is one thing that we have to really rely on the people posed to be in power to address accurately and honestly no one knows the right way to do this there's some real good protocols and replaced for 4p keeping people healthy and protecting each other and staying away from each other as much as possible and wiping things down and using hand sanitizer and stopping the spread yes for sure but no one knows how to get this thing started again no one knows what's going to happen and in the meantime what about the other diseases that are still around but about the colds and flus and what about all that stuff that kills more people than any of these things including covid-19 projections attacks not knowing I mean you don't know if you can prevent this right you know you know you eat well you can you look after yourself you'll be less likely to have a heart attack but you don't know if you can breathe can't breathe in a heart attack thing is all dependent upon your genetics as well as some people that have a predisposition to heart attacks but I'm wrong and it's so you must I'm just kind of curious how much time do you do spend research and cuz you know you know so much information 99% of the time you Jamie Google things to correct me in Midstream Instinct sort of the the you know the truth through the b******* and then you kind of cuz cuz I mean because everything is so polarized oh I've got to choose to say this because that's what everyone saying and they're just kind of saying it cuz everyone saying it was you definitely straddle that line in a way that to me seems incredibly astute but also must be some pressure to to make sure that you're right tell me about it this is b******* Go music is my daddy is being he's being like a real elf have a hard conversation things I make mistakes too if you're doing 1500 whatever the f*** shows plus by Companions and shut I don't know JRE MMA shows another 50 those at least write a hundred Jesus number of interactions that most people have with each other are positive right otherwise the world be a war zone on hey what's up hey this thing is podcast the vast majority of the stuff you do is going to be good this going to be moments where those some guy you were taking a left turn and he talked to you and you said f*** you need to know f*** you in like how do you decide to not and I don't feel like you do have an agenda to change or change things in it and it's premeditated Direction you just you're trying to be honest yeah yeah I can tell you just want to be real I wanted I just want to be able to talk to friends about stuff that's actually happening that's it but if you have any at all cuz I want people to do better included do martial arts really think about how you're doing it and More You Realize are others like a lot of stuff I could learn here that's what I want to do I want people to find things and try to get better at them doesn't mean try to be the best does it mean to be obsessed with it there's something that you get out of trying to be better</div>

A lot of sleeping do you not love your neighbors do you want to get sick or is there any been any evidence that that is happening now that there is with our phone specifically to do you know the phone tracking who destroyed like are they to the concept of it is definitely available right the concept of it of contact tracking is being talked about openly and then if if a company Shores figured out I say it's like there was a place to go right this is becoming interesting so say there's a place you go Tom Green you go and they give you a vaccination what's a vaccination comes available and you know that you now don't have to worry about getting this thing so we can track all the people that have been vaccinated as long as you sign up for the app and all the people not be vaccinated you see them and see them on the app well before we stepped in this mall will see what kind of shity f****** citizen through have been vaccinated you're not allowed in the mall on a map and it will get real weird yeah it's another step a really quick step in a dragging us into the machine and to take away you know the nuances of just human life they were accustomed to and it would become more more digitized and organized and people need Freedom man and if you don't have the freedom to just be somewhere without the government knowing that they're like it if you haven't committed any crime you're not a criminal and if they can just monitor you and you've never committed any crime that has a weird place that's weird things getting weird is supposed to be supposed to be following criminals only and I know it makes it easier for you to follow criminals if you can follow everybody but you were changing what everybody is you change if you follow them all the time everywhere they go if you listen to everything that they ever say through the microphone and they're f*** changing what they are and you're making up scared and everybody knows it and no one wants to admit it you're making people scared of people do things because they don't want censorship they don't to be censored then we yell at they self-censor they don't want to be not in compliance it changes their behavior we all know that we all know that it's dangerous to creativity dangerous to authenticity is dangerous to so many things it's not it's not a good way to be as a person like looking over your shoulder people to watch you all the time 2 we're just too weird too weird to force the hold and then who's got control that the government like what some people that got elected to a position the only one to get the look in and everybody and then would have that opens up with you know everybody can look in and everybody f*** it the information act what is kind of given to the evitable tell me to watch this s*** I'm going to watch you s*** from your toaster cuz you toast yeah man it's not going to be pretty but it's almost like we're taking a step closer and closer towards the digital world with this and that's I don't I'm not a conspiracy theorist in the sense that I don't I don't I don't think that robots are out to get us I don't think that the electronic world is looking to consume us but I am concerned with some steps that we could take that make our life more digital to take away too much of what it means to be a person some what it means to be a person is like fun is this find the weirdness of the world there's fun in the danger of the world you take away all that s*** with apps but and and alerts and you know and like where I can't go down that street there's a guy down the street that was arrested at one point in time s*** to do for safety and then we become what would have become his unromantic boring bulshit digital things that are locked in the pleasure sources it pumpkin pleasure to they taking the place you know me really they could do that if they could get to a point where you wear an implant it just keeps your dopamine levels up at a very high high note you get augmented reality glasses were buddies hot and be pretty cool do you like The Matrix member when the one dude was given into matrices like luck I just want to be an important person or Duncan actor some memories writing he's</div>

I like what you can't believe sometimes people I out there that don't do that that are in like the media that are in this that sort of video loves this s*** more than I mean how to hate Trump when it's like 90% they're f****** fault part is there's a lot of different things going on in sports you want your team to win that's a huge amount of that you know that movie Annihilation with Natalie Portman where they buy the same people can see that movie now alright well when you see the time to watch it it's pressing against the door she's fighting it and then she stops for a minute and then she gives it a grenade and pulls it in and gets away by being the more she would fight it would give equal reaction back at her reflection and you hate it the more they fight it the more it presses them back up against the door and that's that's there's nothing I'm never going to figure out how to just like give him the grenade and pull the pin and walk away cuz they can't like a Uzi he definitely makes mistakes but they are also so wrapped up in everything that he does in a way that they distort even things that probably turn out to be a good idea anything you like I'll do a thing every f****** day and what you going to do and people like there's like a bunch of us don't follow me they like his genius all the time you see Fighters talk s*** to each other right one of the reason why they talk s*** to each is it trying to get the other person emotionally invested in the fight right to try to get him angry and pissed off we're going to do something irrational they're not going to be logical right that's what you're saying front and he was like the people that vote for a feel like that Obama feeling that's what it's such an offense it's anything Obama did or didn't do its the feeling that it's send it right when you want that back always said about him I forget about his policies like he was a great Statesman the way he would talk that's because he was reserved and he was articulate and smooth and when you would hear them talk but that's an excellent representation of the United States where's like the thing with Trump is that he's you know like you said he's not really a politician so he's just being the guy who's always been there but it's like I thought you were going to be a president though I thought you going to act like we need cuz you want to be called POTUS people got him for specifically the opposite of that it's done now so people still want that The West Wing or whatever the f*** like that's what it is it's like your West Wing kind of people that you want well I think it exposes how not rigged it is cuz it's only controlled it no f****** way to know you don't like trolls some of it well this is one of the reasons why they're so scared of Tulsi gabbard cuz she doesn't lay down like that you see that moment was Kamala Harris in the debates they haven't either the internal thing you got to settle with all the people that are actual left that are like mad and they want their Trump so they're not going to go along with the same cuz cuz I think a lot alike just liberals don't get that the the lefties hate you more than they hate or not they hate you more than any right-winger just a regular liberal that's who they want to get them that's why they turn on Eleanor whoever the f*** cuz they're waiting to have a reason to turn on you cuz cuz I think a lot alike just liberals don't get that the the lefties hate you more than they hate a Nazi they hate you more than any right winger just a regular liberal that's who they want to get them that's why they turn on Ellen or whoever the f*** cuz they're waiting to have a reason to turn on you</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> has there been discussion it like as anybody brought this out like a Dan Crenshaw was not aware of this when I discussed it with him when they were talking about federally legalizing marijuana right it's not just about saying it's okay for kids right it's a it's about mitigating these problems that you have with cartel sure is when there is an illegal opportunity to sell something that there's a demand for than the criminals going to sell it and that's what we have now exactly and it has there been discussion like to someone to bring this up like this is one of the primary problems with having marijuana federally illegal with California having its state legal that there is this massive confusion in this you know diminishing of penalties in California with growing illegally there totally is and you know you got the opposite ends of the Spectrum in and here's what we're learning with regulation I've always said this I said look if we're going to regulate and we need to regulate to stop this black market let's do it smart you know let's for one everything we we we really try to push here in California was regulate legitimate cannabis the correct way keep people safe child it tested make sure those pesticides cartel pesticides are absolutely man and other people they're not destroying waterways when I get in gunfights over it great you know no problem but for like that you know the outdoor trespassing with these cartels let's take that funding and put more effort into stopping that you know that's not water down to misdemeanors and infractions things like that and you know it's an even if we keeping take cannabis out of the equation show from the standpoint of I remember a few years ago as quoted by the Associated Press of saying if cherry tomatoes were so desired on the black market or illegal and people were paying $4,000 a pound for cherry tomatoes we haven't gun fights over cherry tomatoes and having band Poison Sun cherry tomatoes that are kids are being in the salads you know because of the black market so you can take you know cannabis even out of the equation and look at the environmental in and look at the public safety but we have to do something to regulate this thing uniformly over the across-the-board and we have to break the black market but what I've seen and I go into the last chapter of my new book hidden were extensively on this is what are the challenges moving forward after seeing regulation in play for 2 years boots-on-the-ground watching it and having a great relationship with legit legitimate cannabis Growers and I'll tell you a few stories that really open my eyes and and got us unified right cuz the whole thing is we the unified on this concept non-polarized left to ride anti cannabis grow cannabis let's get you to fight environmental safety Public Safety all of it but because of how we regulated and the licensing fees and the protocol and everything else we've had all of these you know Black Market growers in the 215 days that wanted to get legal and saw everything coming into cost to do it and being on Big Brothers radar or law enforcement's radar and they backed out like in Humboldt County we had it like I want to stay in the better part of ten to fifty thousand Growers ready to regulate and we barely got a thousand you know and they went you know I can't afford to go through this permitting process I can't afford the delay so I'm just going to go back on the black market I'm not going to be on the radar and that has to stop if we're going to regulate right now the thing it was what was really interesting and I never saw this coming but win and we're about to roll out prop 64 and you know it had been voted and recreational and in the medical laws were tidying up how's the first law enforcement guy being from a marijuana enforcement team to to go into these California Grower Association hosted grower meetings in Santa Cruz right over the hill from my place right and I mean I'm in the oven be to use the camo bottoms the polo I'm going in might you might rain attire for met and the look on 500 Grovers faces when I walked into that meeting just like what you doing here tell your story I'm going to show you a powerpoint it's going to be graphic I'm not here to work anybody you know I'm here to unify just hear what I have to say no judgement and so I was on these guys aware of how big the situation was before because bite but anyway I explain that literally would back in hundreds and hundreds of yards of pipe and tubing like roses on their back other tough yeah I've got I got photos in the new book on trail cam with felt on their feet covering their tracks with the sea bags 100 + pounds and a split pipe they're tough and there I mean to look at the environment they live in for 6 months man they're all Outdoors but I was at this meeting and I gave the presentation I talked about it and it was crazy to see look a shock on these these groups faces I mean some women were in tears some of the guys were just like pissed off and pump in their face and they're like that's b******* we are not about that we're not about doing anything bad with our water we like our wild life we just want to grow cannabis we want to be regulated you know and it was such a turnaround you know from the traditional relationship between law enforcement and a cannabis world and has to be the one guy there with all of the growing Community there and then go from complete horror that I was there isn't a berseria judgment or anything of that or you know to to do anything negative from enforcement standpoint to suddenly haven't real talks about was going out and and I could kind of see the authenticity but genuine is on some of their faces reacted to my slides to the videos and so when I left that first meeting I remember I just got flooded in my patrol truck and I had Apollo with me my little lab and she's an icebreaker I thought well could be an interesting meeting I should have the dog for pets you know and she jumped in and I always Growers were coming to my truck and I'm packing up my stuff and while this is weird and was always you know farmer supervisors from all over the state Mendocino County of the Emerald Triangle Santa Cruz just give me their cars and I have work I have resources we will hike and clean up a grow with you let us help the Met team let us help the Cannabis program whatever we can do and no no charge and and that was genuine man I was really really taken back by that in a positive way and I realized if we get the legitimate Farmers on her side and they're aware of this they will help Market that message nikhil they have money and they have money Cochran campus as it is right but if we could allocate that taxes absolutely to you guys would be incredible where's the money going let's have a certain percentage of it designated for wardens that's starting to happen to because what's now that we've had a couple of years and we're seeing some of the regulatory funding on the taxes trickle back I'm in contact with my team all the time I still get to see him periodically and train and do things like that and really give him a shout out for amazing Risser taken in the work they're doing and promote their message with her out there doing but the money starting come back to us now we're starting to get equipment we start to get more bodies or starting to get like overtime funding so the ridiculous long hours are small Teamworks are compensated for that just happened literally you know within a month or two of Abbey on the show with you so we should have some positives it's great stuff makes your mouth smacked out gives a little it does a little more problems they still have a black market you know and anything right now because we're not regulating federally and so every state anything that's grown stays in that perlot right but every all the demand is back east in these non-regulated states are I don't grow it sew Colorado has you know when Interstate Black Market that's done by the you know quasi legitimate Growers as well as the cartel element so they're still that black market thriving within you know the black market cannabis industry that isn't cartel public lands we got different mixes and we've got a different kind of a problem in Colorado so they don't have as many Epsom I talked to those guys work with him a little bit and they do have some but again they're kind of like where I'm at Montana now tight little growing when do you know early winners late father's plea don't have a very good growing season Outdoors the conditions aren't Prime like they are here in Cali this is a giant issue that is largely undiscussed and it's one of the reasons why I was so fascinated by that podcast isn't it and this is one more one more piece of the puzzle when you talk about border control somehow or another we've gotten into this state in our country this this place our country where some people want to control the border and some people don't want any borders right and do you have to understand that this is the number one problem with the border the number one problem with the borders cartel violence cartel violence cartel crime that's the number one problem and the giant percentage of these people that are coming over and doing illegal activity or doing it because it's profitable write a reason why profitable is because it's illegal and so they can do these things and then sell marijuana Friday all over this country illegally because it's illegal and if it was legal we could regulate it we could tax it the money go into schools and pay for guys like you and and go to fixing this problem instead we're playing this little stupid game where you know some states are legal in some states are and lets lets you know and it's federally it's still schedule 1 time when there's millions of legitimate law-abiding taxpaying citizens and enjoy it and crazy it is and into that point you know you you look at you know the discrepancy and just the inconsistency on cannabis regulation some states I'm not federally not but when you go to the Border issue you brought up that good point of it's not just that cartel element for Discount this poison cannabis stuff for this toxically Tina canvas as a better way to phrase it it's the smuggling traffic in this all those other crimes I may have sediment production so I'm not sure I get asked a lot like after you know what you had a great conversation with the with with my Baker on this was no are open borders going to work and no again about some regulation it's just not going to work does not even so that's why I open borders are going to wear it right if the world was even then start a dialogue in last week. Yeah boy is he scared the s*** out of you though when he comes to the stories about Maco about how bad I was down there and there's there's just an insane amount of violence it's going on down there and it's insane amount of crime and so much of it is connected to the illegal drug trade and it looked that you're not going to kill at all if you make marijuana legal but you would kill a percentage at least it would make it a little bit better and Woodstock that yeah it one of the things we we we get from from getting that regulation if we can stop that black market for you know cartel weed we're going to save a lot of wildlife we're going to preserve a lot of water weighs right because all those other crimes are very heinous and very destructive and I hate to see the human trafficking and all the meth problems and and anything related to violence or by deterioration of a soul but you know I love the wild man was Irma Church yours D I mean what you do for conservation the elk hunting that you're doing all those different things it's magical out there and it's just most people just don't even know I don't think know but I know you don't get a chance to experience what it's like to actually be a real Woodsman the real woods Witcher but what you're getting shrinker smaller and smaller and smaller even here in Cali that is so much Beauty but I look at it this way I said look if we lose all over open space to a problem like this and a compound the problem and we lose our wildlife and good water you may not be in the outdoors right now you might be a preservationist you might be you know on your freaking digital ice all the time and looking at Wildlife through through screen but if you ever do go out and you get that peace and Tranquility to get Center like we do run a trail hike Aveeno LA County Mountain Trail open space don't even get that far in the woods it's just soothing you know brings us back to our Center in you know if the new generations that aren't getting that from the cities can get that or they get their kids doing it with our grandkids are here about it but it's not there to go do that to me man we're just we're just not paying for it this is this is something I got to stay on and I really appreciate you and what you stand for because of the message I think just some people don't know yeah I just think that's a big part of it I said I don't know what's interesting to me to is that the allocation of resources that it's it's so when you have something that's illegal you're not getting any of that money no and if it was legal there's an enormous amount of money that could go to schools and fix the roads and we can allocate it to a bunch of different big time you leave ways to spend it and we're not doing that and it's it's the reason why is because that illegal and this is crime problem is very similar to what they faced during prohibition with alcohol and you the rise of organized crime and that's where they were getting their money from because there was such a demand it's really a disgusting dumb way to approach problem that is many people's ideas of social problem that money could go to so many. positive things for perpetuating it true that reason and many others we're basically you know we're basically embedding a problem in our country and Ed said this called romwe our dialogue in earlier this week and he said you know he's kind of look at things from the border and South and the issues coming in from the border from the cartel front he said you know now getting into your book and I'm starting to analyze what year you guys are fighting on the ground inside the borders of California the rest of country goes it's embedded now I mean it's not like it's just coming across mean the Enterprises in here in the nation because they have the pipeline they have the distribution they have a market and they don't have to deal with border issue and round for bull because of exactly where we're at and when people aren't aware of and in California that it's just a misdemeanor which is even more so yeah it's that's got to change a background and crime especially violent crime and you get caught doing something like that I mean it should be severe severe penalty it should absolutely severe the same Grace that is when we get the environmental crimes that we bring from the fish and wildlife standpoint to those charges for these guys we get it back to felony status because we had an interesting thing happen as soon as all that regulation started two years ago and the water you know those trespass programs or water down hangover talking about District Attorney's all throughout the state said oh man we're not going to be able to prosecute these crimes I mean we're not going to have you know we're not going to have a jury that's static to these issues it's not worth it some Sheriff's departments were saying hey we know how violent these guys are we know your team's been in like six gun fights man and your partner was almost killed in 05 in the first one you guys take these guys head on you know you want to protect your Wildlife whatever but they're not stopping and it's a misdemeanor and we can't convict him so we're not going to play so a backlash of those crimes be watered down Joe was team stop working it except us and like the feds you know and not only that. execute so I remember speaking for the California District Attorneys Association on this and saying guys are the solution everybody no matter where they sit on the Cannabis Spectrum everybody hates to see Bambi dead water poisoned everyone has a little bit of environmental passion in my both sides of the fence and that's why I say here we get to the you we can unify and not worry about where we sit on the performer against and if you take these water code enhancements if you take the felony in the penal code from the band you take these water code enhancements if you take the felony in the penal code from the band toxic Carlos here in if you take a streambed alteration diversion or dead Wildlife or littering close to estate Waterway you stack all those up you get all these penalties and you can convicted on that you know even in a sympathetic jury on Sia cannabis issues so we started to prosecute these cases and it started to come back and it's an arduous and around it's more work than we should have to do but we're doing</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> Sears man we are just tested on yes apparently it's been some controversy about this so just let me let everybody know right away there's no shortage of antibody tests and what were using there's no shortage of them people say white people in the front light and it's just misunderstanding and confusion these tasks there's no shortage of I understand some people in some places have a hard time getting access to the test not the case here so I take it upon myself to test everybody as a coming to the studio is not taking away from anybody that's on the front lines cuz I'm taking test away from any medical workers that does the test they would use for them particularly that they're using swabs I mean look man those f****** people that are working in those hospitals in the medical workers those people are legit hero yes you know and if I found out that there was something we were doing that was somehow another taking away from there would you be tested I would never do it so people got upset apparently because people writing articles about things cuz you know it's like it's Hot Topic right and their own people like posted some story making comments from Instagram and using them as quotes just some random mcgough that's posting something in this one of them said that we were low-key flexing that we had tests higher time I just shared with you earlier today there was a new study that Jamie Siri pull up that study it is out of I think it's out of UCLA is that what I do it's it says early antibody tests indicate far more cases and a much lower mortality rate Ryan so they think there's at least four hundred. people have been infected in in California so the mortality rate is way way lower than they previously thought it was at least in California you know it's obviously varies there's a crazy disease if it's raised doesn't make any sense it varies depending upon your physical condition whether or not you've been smoking with a night is apparently up a great benefit to exercising regularly even while you have it if you cash it exercising but then it was his f****** what is that guy's name the fox thing we'll do the first there's a there's one on La, look at you indicates far more covid-19 cases lower mortality rate there's a decrease in number of deaths study indicates that there could be hundreds of thousands of people could be infected without knowing it that's what's so weird about it the only time they think that if they catch it before the symptoms set in you survive survive but if they don't catch it for the symptoms I didn't like you just get rabies you don't get over like I do every black person I know always cross the street the only time they think they if they catch it before the symptoms set in you survive survive but if they don't catch it for the symptoms I didn't like you just get rabies you don't get over like I do every black person I know always cross the street when they see a random dog</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> but to share that with everybody nationally in my world in the thin green line and for them to start having it happening on the refuges and even just a know this stuff's getting back to their parts of the world and poisoning there are cannabis users you unsuspectingly horrible information right but we need to know a lot of guys didn't know it and so that was one thing to see hey what we need a baseline training in the way we do it here in California is we all go through a really strange an academy everyone gets their basic tools arrest control defensive tactics and firearms training all of that and get good at being the traditional game warden doing all the traditional stuff and they get you know get get their feet wet out doing their own thing for a couple years and then we start to find the people that have the motivation I want to get onto a specialized unit like our met team or one of the Watershed teams or Wildlife trafficking team very seldomly do we put a fresh person there because you know I think to really be a good game warden you got to cut your teeth on all the traditional stuff Google just how how to check guys with guns all the time you know most cops look at that and go that's crazy I mean everybody you check has a knife or a firearm 99% on work I want to see a game warden and game warden wants to see us but for that one felon it's on parole and he's in the woods hiding out and we run across that a lot and I ran across a ton of that down here and So Cal at the start of my career and I'll get some interesting stories about that but so guys who are like Ben skip bail and then hide yep and they've got like a no-bail warrant their wanted on some warrant somewhere and so they're efficient they have an illegal firearm maybe there a felon in possession of a firearm they can't even have and now they're out and remote area where no cops going to find me here and then on the new game warden the Riverside County you know all freaking motivated really green I don't know totally what I'm doing yet and I'm in that truck cruising and something I got into down here that was just crazy but I will say this was a heck of learning curve and I'm really blessed it went out the way it did and it was definite but we would gang banger something from La here and they would go over in the Riverside County and get into my kind of rule Foothills on the edge of the national forest and they have AK-47s and they have you know automatic pistols and they would Spotlight through these Canyons gun in for everything they kill rabbits that kill coyotes they kill deer they get to the end of like a canyon that has like a an outlet of a damn bro Gill night out and spend all night or just gillnet fish turn freely and shooting and killing everything with the spotlights grab their gillnet grab hundreds of fish pack up and then head back you know back to the LA basin I just retired with what you and Marshall Ave Apollo yellow lab English lab she's amazing never to buy a bad guy but you can't lick them to death and try to shoot right you know turn them our way but I didn't have a companion dog the time and I would go and run into these guys and go okay this is what I learned in the academy that you know that that head-on spotlighting stop that you never want to have her get in behind and blacked out and track them down and next thing I know I got a case and I got all these freaking prohibit exotic weapons and I'm going this is crazy Tony's guys that alone I don't have a lot of last year it was just me how many guys did you run into some time to be to one. I pulled like eight people out of a man and I was alone ocean and they were all armed and it was one of my heaviest most intense cases and I've been on one year so this was 1994 and what we were doing in the Riverside Squad as we were just Saturday in the area cuz we're getting everybody from overlay side here spotlighting all our games are like okay with saturate this and back. Joe the game was to catch a spotlight a right-handed cuz they're so deliver his light spotlights all yeah I should I should have done that but there's a handheld Spotlight flashlight whatever and you going to remote areas and you look to find animals at night because they freeze the really relaxed their eyes glow and then you shoot him that way you kill him illegally at night after dark which is never allowed you know it's usually in or out of hunting season any ones go Spotlight a deer nine times out of ten they're they're not lice they're not going to do it during season like we do so they're doing that so in the in our world is game wardens that's the ultimate Wildlife criminal because they're going to kill those you know that have that unborn trophy Buck for good genetics they're going to kill a trophy deer weigh in the right you know that you know needs to go another year or whatever so that's what we focused on that was like if I can cut my teeth and get you know become a reputable game or in a going after the hardcore is that was the game then it was 94 and I'm pulling these guys out call him Alan Ladd I've got my weapon on him and I'm like oh man there's a lot of guys out there I can't get him to jail I'm calling back up I got Riverside County coming and I'm even have the Sheriff's Office helicopter come in several nights once we got to know each other and they realized who is this game or an order these game worms Riverside County going out and dug just crazy areas by themself they monitor our traffic and they come in on the helicopter and light it up and call them I'll call these bad guys out on loudspeaker system make sure we were okay and feels good when the calvary comes on those nice man let me tell you they just didn't know that you would ever run into someone that's that arm that many guys and a van or what have you ate people but it says hold there was a reason why your Patron by yourself because they didn't anticipate anything like this well and we do know the bodies right this was one of the things that was crazy we get back to the thin Green Line concept and realize it one game warden is responsible for 200 to 250 square miles give or take you know so I squat a seven-game words to put in perspective check this out brother so when I was supervising traditional Patrol before we started the special ops met team in Santa Clara County we always have vacancies because we always alone bodies we couldn't hire game Words fast enough we weren't funded for it over the case maybe so we might have for 5 game wardens for 7 positions and we had to cover all the Santa Clara County which is everything from the city to all those Foothills and there's a lot in Silicon Valley people don't realize all of San Benito County which is huge Hollister Gilroy right where I'm from in Gilroy that whole area down to the South that is just mass amount country full of Wildlife and then like part of Monterey County and I had five people in myself as Lieutenant that is insane I can't believe that so to go out on a spot to that point and have a partner with you just one other game warden that stuff you know you're basically pulling a whole other area you can work 9 or so is spotlighting common it is still going on in the state and its going on a lot back then here because we've been so little presents here in Southern California it was off the hook it was crazy one week in 1994 I remember I was at a really good ride along with me a wildlife biologist social Savvy Hunter great eyes he became kind of like my right-hand man Brian and we I said we're going to catch spotliter every night this week just think so I was a crazy let's see if we can do it and so we went and worked all night long you start Monday night how do you catch a body look for a spotlight like what you give me an appointment glass it's ya just like the glass in a big Basin for help write in a really good OverWatch you get the most visibility in a pie the truck and you watch and you find areas where it's likely to happen and it takes awhile to learn where that's going to be just because you got this huge district and you could have 20 places where guy spotlight you get into the areas a new war normally get to figure it all out you don't know where to be in it it's a trial-and-error but it took me six months give or take adjust just going out and it's gotten hard and in seeing where this road goes and how does that canyon look what type of water do I have down there what am I seeing a low light in the evening when animals are coming to Waterloo I got to hold her to healthcare I got a whole herd of deer got some bucks you know I'm seeing other animals run around this is going to be a hot spot because guys can get to it and if you just put the time and you just kind of lion wait you don't come up with tied together just like hunting big game eventually starts happening and by 1994 and I've been in District a year down here I pretty much had my spots figured out my partners in other parts of Riverside did too so we'd all be out alone so we can cover more area and talking back and forth I mean and I'm a date myself here but cell phones brand new so I'll have those flip cell phones and we're it was the flip phone you have the Star Trek Communicator, partnered really love those where you at their crate Haystack type thing you know but once you get into it you get really good at it but it it always is difficult because again just the percentages of catching a guy on the right night that he's going to be out there and then you got the guys are kind of get Savvy to North game warden lives driving by his house looking for his patrol truck to see if he's out that night where's the truck parked we start getting into that problem so we always kind of you know kind of maintain as covert as we can you know we're known in the neighborhood in the thing is we live at home we work out of our homes home crossword clue store Community because if we kept our truck in a field office we have no response time all spread out so we get very community-oriented in in community functions and conservation groups and everybody knows us whether it's a big city or small little town in the mountains so you got guys doing the cat-and-mouse thing looking for us and you know making sure he has his truck there or is he out patrolling I'll maybe I won't go out tonight but that would show in in 1994 was was off the hook I didn't get a spot lighter every night that week but I got 6 out of 7 at 1 a double so it's crazy Mom Season the time guns and you know some guys were going to jail somewhere but a lot of wildlife would say that night because they wouldn't they would it would have done a lot of harm you know most of these guys are they doing this recreationally forefathers unit for food like what are they the group I was getting into down here it was it was recreational it might have been to sell the meat I couldn't prove that or it was just to go kill stuff you do get people that need me you know that do Spotlight after dark because they need the meat and stuff like that it's still a violation we still deal with it as such but if we ascertain that we're going to be fair about it you know we said okay look you're poaching I know you're starving it's out of season since season you have a tag but you just really got to get that meat I mean there are certain cases we just kind of feel for that person to go I see what the motivation was you know and a very small percentage of poachers are that way but some of them were just you know they're just trying to feed their family and it's a whole different game we're going to be fair about it or we should be fair but most of them gang Bangerz are most of them criminals like what there's it was there a felony she Ridge down here seventy 80%. Criminal histories had illegal weapons associated with gains those almost like Recreation for that little boy that was practice guys pretty inebriated pretty liquored up and I'm as a head-on stop and one of them had a like a $50,000 no bail warrant for cocaine trafficking phone case down here that was a pretty crazy one it was it was three guys pretty inebriated pretty liquored up and almost a head-on stop and one of them had a like a $50,000 no bail warrant for cocaine trafficking out of Mexico and that was in that week that we had you know crazy Spotlight things going on so it was just the demographic of down here we're up north it it won't it won't be necessary that fell into that guy that just wanted a trophy buck and to get it cheap to get</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what is the is there an estimate of how many cartel members are growing in this country right now if it with you save there's 27 28 States is that what you said what is the is there a rough estimate of how many cartel members are here right now doing this kind of this comes to it you know it's it's a real approximation because you only know based on who you catch your driving ability breathe but like in California when you're from the amount of grows we we deal with every year just on the trespass you know cartel front number of operatives it takes to run a grow and get it started and then harvested I mean conservative estimate 10,000 10,000 very conservative because it's such a kind of a silent Enterprise and it's really hard to get some of this data but we've we've just validated it through the numbers of things we run across you know when you look at the fact that it takes to skill Growers that are vetted because they cut their teeth done do do it effectively under the Federalist nose and they grow well in and you mention this weekend Mike Baker on the show which was interesting and you hit on the head when you said man these guys are really resourceful you know if you got to respect their work ethic and now you have to because they're there hiking water line of hiking infrastructure in their covering their tracks they're out there for 6 months at a time whole lot of photos in that book about things we've seen on trail cameras and they will put felt-lined line soft felt on their shoes time of tight and if they're walking like an Old Forest Road you know that's got a gravel base you'll never see that track I mean you know you've tracked a game I've done it you know it's the same type of technique and if you don't have any sign I mean the really good at disguising to actually found a guy and I have a picture of this in the book and also in the PowerPoint when I when I teach this throughout the country actually carved out of wood because a couple years ago we were in the u.s. forest service a lot of this grow problem is on or national forest you know Northern California Northeastern California not so much Silicon Valley where I started but the rest of this day even down here and what these guys to do with those cattle leases on those properties were in a Rancher can run cattle and part of the forest and you know originally on private property and we were getting tips on a bunch of crows you know where you seen from the air or Hunter Wrangler would report them or we do suspicion cuz of water weigh and we get see some plants from satellite or whatever and we go try to find the screen we weren't picking up tracks and we're we're pretty good at finding these things now we've been trialling are in it for a lot of lot of years but we're sitting like Halifax cuz we're running around with cows and sure enough they were putting on calipers and strap them on top or underneath their their boots clomping around to disguise themselves as cattle clever right and then once I get way up into a deep Canyon where they're going to put or they just take them off and throw my backpack in the light bulb went off with we better look at you know our tracks little more carefully so how do you guys try to go about finding these things do you do rely on people reporting them or do you have like aerial surveys how do you it's it's a mix of all event we get a lot of reports from people in the ground and are our best reporting parties or we call our peas are Hunters &amp; Anglers I'm going to come to the outdoor public but across some butt Hunters &amp; Anglers especially because where do we go when we when we're going to find a good water hole for Elk or you know what hunting black-tail we're going to go stay on the beaten path man we're going to go down to the headwaters we're going to find a pristine area we're going to get away from people so people that are going the deepest into the backcountry absolutely absolutely in their finding the water you know source and then maybe they're following it and it's dry or it's diverted like what I found in 2004 that started this whole craziness and running to aggro we also do find it from the area now we do all agencies it's no no secret and no tactical reveal we've we fly look for the stuff from the air I have a friend of found one on Tejon Ranch really yeah yeah a few years back and I didn't think anything of it I thought it was just some crazy person decided try to grow pot his back for is recreationally legal okay and it was no shootout or anything crazy like that they got there after realize that their grow up it been compromised and they took off but you know Tejon Ranch has enormous thick 270,000 Acres yeah and just the gall of these guys to go deep into that ranch and set up this grow site right on the guys who work there they I guess they just stumbled upon it I think they stumbled upon it because of garbage to if I remember correctly yeah that that that follows track in the thing now you're talkin about private hunting ranches got a catalyst and all that tones huge we've done a lot of good stuff supported you know good hunting programs are but an interesting statistic when I retired last year in December 2018 you know I mean we keep stats ever since one of the cool things about the are specialized team start in 2013 as we solidified all the documentation to be spot-on you know reporting was kind of haphazard throughout this day we weren't sure what other agencies were doing but we knew what we were doing now and so I'm keeping that data and there was a real shift in just public land presence of these cartel Growers and by the time I retired last year I won't have 50/50 split so ranches like Tejon Ranch a private hunting club in the Silicon Valley one up in Shasta County so you know where they're doing big-time conservation projects to get black tail and mule deer in Tule elk and everything else up and numbers and now they've got this presents on their hunting club hitting one of their sensitive waterways you know so so it's it's not just a public land thing is really good for everybody listening to know that you can find it anywhere in and you stumbled on it and it is 20 mm reporting parties a cool thing after I did Stephen show on a mediator and talk to those guys was hard to get tips actually got a tip and you know when it's it's in play and I won't say too much more about it but will definitely be talking when it's all over and done but it's it's going to get handled and it's so cool to see the guys like you and I didn't love it and love the passion of what's out there are out there stumbled on this stuff and getting out safely and and were fired up enough not to wait you don't work for calling people to say it's out there can you help us Ritz award a mediator and talk to those guys we start to get tips actually got a tip and you know when it's it's in play and I won't say too much more about it but will definitely will be talking when it's all over and done but it's it's going to get handled and it's so cool to see the guys like you and I didn't love it and love the passion of what's out there are out there stumbled on this stuff and getting out safely and and were fired up enough not to wait you don't work for calling people to say it's out there can you help us with the warden Sheriff's</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> don't these dogs that your training know Phoebe was like there was very interesting listening to how effective is using Belgian Malinois that were using your permit earlier main dogs Belgian Mel and Powerful dogs they are amazing so smart and I can't talk enough about it man cuz no matter where you sit everybody loves a good dog story and you know some people say well Dual Purpose you got a bike guys what's what with that is really aggressive and look at it's a lifesaver for everybody it's a lifesaver for us Lifesaver for the suspect to because it usually involves a potential gunfight at the dog basically you know alleviated because she or he was there so we got our K-9 program in agency going kind of full speed around 2018 I'm at 3 we have three levels of canine we have like the companion right along canine the kind of does everything with you she's never going to bite anybody unless Apollo that's like my lap right then we have the detection level dog eye muscles are Labradors like Marshall like Apollo because Labs have such amazing noses they really can hold on sent you know that they can trained it to Tech many cents and we certify him and different things and then there's the feebies you know the bells romells or the Shepherds and really it's become mostly males now in our age why Mount horse shelters in the heat you know Shepherds have longer hair and 100° weather we're on Long hikes you know or unsupported those dogs might have to sit quietly after hiking 8 Miles and sit in a prone quietly while we're watching observing and stocking it on suspects to make an apprehension in a rest safely and hopefully avoid a gunfight so and we also found with the with the males it's like I said they just hold up better on average and they're certainly exceptions to that but when we got our Dual Purpose program back on track these are dogs that will buy 22 on command but they have great noses so let's still detect wonderfully you know Finding evidence fine in tainted weed whatever the case may be a firearm a bear gallbladder all of that but they'll also you know like Phoebe was nicknamed the fur missile because when it was time for her to go to work and some guy was going to pull a weapon on us she was all business and cool thing about a dog like her in the end and Michael and I got into I'll hit you especially in he was going away he said I've never heard of a dog in a domestic law enforcement team that's had like a hundred sixteen apprehension bites in her career and she has 216 know JoJo Diaz on the cool thing about that was a stampede of life she saved and she also arrest another 8 to 900 that she didn't have to buy in her career why how many of you guys arrested when I retired with over thousand and in five and a half years yeah and we ran against all grow-ops grow-ops are related to grow up so that they are all guys that are armed all gussied up knives or guns you know that you're not getting bit unless you know you're a deadly force threat on some level or significant threat so yeah it's been a lot of guys so that number that you talking about 10,000 I think it's very much so yeah that is so insane because if you fly over like Humboldt or any any of these areas I can particularly medicino Northern California the density of the forest of the the the public land out there there's a lot of land there's a lot of land in a lot of potential we're not seeing so and that's still still thriving so when you you know when you when you look at Phoebe has a canine and you go well let's see if she was in the field doing these type of operations for about seven or eight and yeah that's great for my records standpoint and numbers in the life you save but it gives you a like a like a snapshot of the issue how many guys did we not catch that were out there or that we weren't involved in and the dogs are just say lives man they have saved this in the new book especially in 2012 but right before our team started Phoebe save my life Brian's life and all these other operators in Santa Clara County in Silicon Valley right where I grew up engage the guy that was pulling up a Russian automatic pistol on me and I was the support for the for Brian I was basically a k9 Handler or support guy and Brian had to deal with this other Growers partner that had a big Taurus Judge revolver on his hip and he was pulling it so he goes for that guy and says John just take my dog to be something by it and he's biting this guy in the calf and yeah this guy's nose down and we don't know he's got this weapon and I start to see it coming out and I get on him and I do what I need to do some physical control and Strikes and whatnot to get the gun Christian but had she not been on that guy in a bike show. Guns turned on me at 5 feet I'm engaged All The Rifleman behind me on you know I'm in a gunfight again we've been in too many of those already how many gun fights in 6 and I've been on the ground for four out of the six there guys have been involved in and they've all been around this particular problem we had a lot last once the team about formalize and so we started using dogs but we still had two during the window of the team being operational that we could avoid and dog four out of the six other guys have been involved in and they've all been around this particular problem we had a lot less once the team got formalize and so we started using dogs but we still had two during the window of the team being operational that we could avoid and dogs played a big part in that as I go into a new stories</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> Trump like even Trump like as much as he hates it he has tone down a lot of his rhetoric because of the criticisms he's faced you know and that's it's important it's very important to him and he has the that's one thing as viruses making everybody have to do their job everyone have to actually do their job wondering if you would do it again all over again if you knew how hard it would be and how much you would get s*** on I don't know I think it was so funny when he presented to me was like it was like like the hot new nightclub you know what I mean like everybody was in there you know what is like like a nightclub and you can pretend to be who you want to be and you can just in the coronavirus comes and that's like when the lights come on in the club and you get to see you know I have fuckedupshit really is and and so was when the cold country just kind of like I said I was going to go with your biting regardless of how loose if you feel he is or how sharp you thinking is when the whole country is like his Uncle Joe just let me think like Trump is like a fancy a nice resort like hotels is the number one thing I want to do that but after awhile you get tired of spending $21 for internet and $40 for pancakes and you just want to go home and enjoy his kind of sent it felt like he represent home you don't mean like people I kill all the kids dementia but I think he's going to be propped up by so many different people going to motor like President Obama's going to come out in the door soon and if he doesn't listen that's crazy what I'm saying because he's familiar he was dead next to the guy that we all felt more comfortable with especially in situations like this endorsement video straight up gaslighting matter whether or not I think he's going to lose I do think is going to lose record even if I thought he's going to win he shouldn't do the job he there's no way you can take the pressure of that position with the cognitive decline that he's already showing but there's no but you just want the Democratic party to be back in control I get it how much time does Michael open the damn trying to give you an example to me just the way that Trump is handling having any kind of criticism is anything it's unsettling it's like so you have to have degrees or whatever but to be in charge of everybody else that guy who's in charge of everybody else is just it's like man I just wish he didn't cost so much just wasn't the way he he was you know what I mean I wish you could just take the kids seriously once again into office and Uncle did expect him to yeah he's always been the guy that if anybody says anything about him he talked mad s*** about that person wonders never lied to you or respect all of that but it's just like in times like this one is required some empathy and say I feel for the people that are dying not give me credit I come over it so I feel like so what I'm saying is I feel like having Joe come up there and play those notes it feels like he will everyone just all of a sudden overnight goes Joe Biden's our guy it felt like everyone together but what is going to be like after a year in office dealing with International Politics the economy the environment for all these different things people how quickly who's going to be the vice president Elizabeth Warren who's going to put in there the country or would it be a good thing for the country because it's the best person for the job both both best person for the best person for the job I feel could be a woman of color in the Best Western Plus country could also be a woman of God because a lot of policies kind of stop before Consulting the people of color in a woman of color can see what we're leaving out this group male of color who's better qualified for the job I don't but that's not my point what is what are the qualifications for this job is is what I just said there's no test you have to take is just a popularity contest remember she just she just did a whole thing about something on Netflix and she was like we aren't even on Ellen's that we just like it was like yeah you probably should I think I'm not the right person to be talking about this but I feel like you know what they say Stacey Abrams is in the running and I don't think he'd be a bad choice but why she just puts things in context and she is very smart very sharp and she is not thrown like she would be extremely qualified she could be president she was the first lady so she's accustomed to the public eye she's accustomed to speaking publicly and that's why they say Joe Biden was the best bet because Joe Biden so Pennsylvania it was a is a swing state and Joe Biden is the only person out of the democratic nominees who did not say he was against fracking he was like you can't you can't be again you can't you can't do it all at once and then they have to have the clip of the fracking protesters at CoCo for somebody else man and he also supports he has an in with you know the coal miners and the fracking industry just like you know Trump so when it comes to Electoral College votes Trump doesn't knows he can't beat them Sy hence the whole Ukrainian get some dirt on them just announced something's happening. I think that was kind of like The Narrative of that and know when it comes to electoral votes that whole Midwest game that whole Michigan Michigan to buy in his right there and that's what I'm saying like them yes man oh no I don't know but what's going to happen once people start hearing him talk on the campaign Trail but I don't know I don't know how I don't know how brilliant or a ticket at Trump is like I don't know I think I think everyone it's a matter of being able to control crowds and have these exciting rallies he does Arenas dude he does sold out Arenas and he kills you want a woman of color to be the vice president wife and I would love that I would love for I'm not saying I would love for things to feel like that I want to say back to normal but I would just love to feel like when the president speaking with it what I'm talking about is his ability to excited base in the ability to get people behind him he's a unprecedented ability and depending upon how he handles this coronavirus crisis they could swing left or right it really depends entirely upon who Biden pics because remember when George W was president is really was like President Dick Cheney doing everyday and Cheney was consistently in the bunker he was in the bunker for like weeks of time they were saying he's an update demon told us he was in a bunker but just in case anything happens like why isn't Bush and government will you have a guy who was the former CEO of Halliburton company that countries after we blow them up getting no-bid contract to rebuild a country that we blew up while he's making the decisions to blow up his country powerful speakers someone who apparently and if they pick someone and I'm sure the groom and someone right now who you get excited about yuto okay this person this person could step if Biden lost or find lost it right or find died which is also possible bro there's a there's a photo of him that was on the New York Times yesterday we can see you like where they gave him the f****** the face is that like you know and just just just how the government works well what the what was it the pandemic agency was closed down in my pantry what's the his lawyers fight what can I do what can I do Shore what can I do what can I do and he just goes you know then he takes his stance based on what he is known he's no he's going to be protected legally and he doesn't equate that he's present of all of us you know I mean it so I just feel like that's what's missing and he is incapable of doing it I know when Prince had the Mike Pence was getting popular at 8 at Trump music you want to talk about advice but I don't know what that guy's voice sounds like somebody so emotional right like nnnn I feel like Trump's a businessman so he he's not approaching this if any emotion and it's a good thing that he did was blocked travel from China that's a good thing that probably saved a lot a lot of people saying you're crazy for doing that but so what do you mean you actually didn't I don't know I just heard that's why I'm saying that I was saying conflicting with Mikey block travel because of diplomatic reasons to go out and go to Chinatown with no worries bullshittin the way out of this while she was blaming the present it look everybody got this wrong everybody got it wrong everybody did fournette 30,000 people of travel from China to u.s. Sister coronavirus surfaced the coronavirus surfaced in this is just a this I think this is just an article about yeah I know but this is an article about when the coronavirus surface which was in January that's just letting people know how I made it over to America that's not how many people came to America this is since Chinese officials disclosed the outbreak on New Year's Eve in two months after the president impose restrictions arrived in January at airports in Los Angeles San Francisco New York Chicago Newark and Detroit all places fuk by Coronavirus what kind of restrictions were they the bulk of The Travelers who were of multiple nationalities arrived in January at airports in Los Angeles San Francisco New York Chicago Newark and Detroit all places fuk by Coronavirus</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you seen all the s*** that point to the fact that this came from a lab viruses there are a ton there's a ton of of scientists that are pointing to that just one French virologist Gmail send you this there's a French virologist who identified HIV and this French virologist was looking at this disease and it's like this is not a disease that came from nature know that this is a disease that came from the lab on Netflix the series on Netflix that takes place in China that like two or three years ago they called the coronavirus in Eli played the thing really yeah there's like episode 13 season 3 or something like that of the show Jesus Christ than they knew this stuff was happening while people knew that it was always a possibility TV industry like it feels like everything is becoming YouTube you know. I mean like all the time or I'll just I'll send you this right now Jamie hold on a second Bill Maher has some great f****** rants I mean these are tweeted twice to him that where I said Bravo yet are you playing it you know he's he's pushing all the buttons you know he's he's doing, he's doing like real edgy comedy while he's pointing out how crazy this all is I appreciate him right now is so sad guy who's on the left that I really I really like the fact that he doesn't give in to all the craziness he doesn't get given to the the lunacy of of left-wing policies he still he still like rational about it all although clearly left-wing bias he still rational goes with comedy but it was well yeah I want some I don't know man I like him a lot and I watch you like a bunch, I want to know cuz I watched some of his stuff and I feel like it's two things you should have me on this show basically cuz he's always talking about kids or he would be talking about he did his whole rant about why can't we call it the China disease and stuff and I was listening to a chinese-american on on The Daily talking about her experience of a feeling like being an Asian-American he was always like a probationary experience as long as I did the right thing and stay out the way people left me alone but when this came up just for going out why people like you f****** Chinese detective you know and and it's kind of like so it is it's me I love watching them because it's because it's also these blind spots that he just his whole rant was really about stop these wet markets you can do it you didn't have to do these but here the other like you know SARS or murderers are two middle eastern respiratory did make that point he was the head of China you know he would say that and then the Chinese guy was saying hey this is the whole world's problems whole world pandemic but yeah kind of but it did come from a f****** if it did if it did come from a lab you know we should call the lab-created Wuhan virus how do we know that this guy's correct it says analysis indicates the virus has a natural origin it was not engineered the so-called unique protein sequences her since found the 2019 coronavirus can be found in many of the organizing not just HIV but that doesn't mean it's organic or natural in origin I think that we are right now in this. Of conflicting information and you going to get it bouncing back and forth from con but I've read multiple sources that seem and end from respected scientist to seem to indicate that there's a distinct possibility that came from that lab one of things they're saying is the actual bats that they sequence The genome when it when it when they found the genetics for this virus the bats that tested you know that we're this originated from where the same exact they're from the same exact locations the bats are they do research on in this lab and Elizabeth form I mean it's not it's not outside the realm of possibility we're in the Wheelhouse what they're obviously I'm a moron I don't know s*** about viruses but when China says all definitely wet Market nothing to see here yeah well the web markets are f****** gross you know it is but that's also a sad thing about you trying to feed a billion people and you feeding them Wildlife a lot of what they're eating as Wildlife they're so cool it's like squirrels in</div>

He's got to go to that got to go to that but that's very important for everybody when people get sick it spreads to all of us now we also we don't want ever to know anyone that you love is going to die because they can't get Healthcare that's available for people that have money that stop that just stop with fire department Fire Department EMS fires on fire how to help Healthcare we should be we what is the what is the what is Covered California what the f*** is that all about that I don't know man I don't mean if you think about how much money gets spent on things right with her it's computers whether it's cars whether it's houses whether it's with his it seems that people by how much of a percentage of that if you could escalate just a little bit and all that money goes into just Healthcare not just taxes worth no one's accountable you don't know where the f*** is going to go everybody's dollar cost $2.05 for most things you buy up to a certain point all that money go straight to healthcare wouldn't you be willing to pay instead of a dollar a dollar five or something if you knew that $0.05 going to go towards Healthcare Ben billions and millions I mean after while it seems like it would be better for everybody and it would be better for us to not worry about what happens if you get sick cuz you don't know if you can deal with pay for it sometimes people get hit with crazy medical bills after the unexpected injury worried about what happens if you get sick cuz you don't know if you can be able to pay for it sometimes people get hit with crazy medical bills after you do an unexpected injury</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> stories crazy it's crazy and I think it's also a really important part of human history imagine if the Whistleblower had not come forward and we didn't know about MK Ultra and and then all those documents didn't get but they didn't find a warehouse for the documents fall back on you know we signing I was with the agency if we talk to you without permission and they're not going to give us permission we could go to prison imagine what life must have been like for them knowing that this is what they were doing people that such a strange way to also these people are agents for the federal government and what kind of precedent does this establishment most of the people doing the research were subcontracted researchers at medical personnel at prisons and in the case of Jolly West he was first in the Air Force and then he was in university settings and jolly was once it got to University of Oklahoma he was experimenting on patients and in one of his letters to God leave asking for more funding he's saying working with psychiatric patients actually benefits us because people can't not quoting directly weird behavior wouldn't be noticed by anybody at the hospitals because they're psychiatric patient so these people are getting LSD which is a pretty powerful drug and Other Drugs he was using and he was hypnotizing them and some of it many of his experiments without without their knowledge and their psychiatric patients I mean that it's worse than Nazis your mind is you know the next most important thing besides your soul and they're tampering with it you know one of the jollies take the guy who actually took over the department when jolly and 69 came out to UCLA from Oklahoma said to me cuz I would show them all the documents and he said he always has one of his best friends I think 45 years when West died in 99 he said what he said to me Jolly it doesn't surprise me that he would have done this this is the Jack Ruby stuff which I guess gotten to yet Jolly was Jack Ruby psychiatrist Jesus after Ruby was convicted of shooting and killing Oswald in the spring of 64 before he was going to testify to the Warren Commission he had never told him never testified at his trial about why he he killed Oswald his defense argument was that he had epilepsy and he had had an epileptic fit and shot him and was amnesiac of the of the the shooting yeah so that's right into the narrative like a key well it's gets better so West inserts and shine through his connections to Ruby's new lawyer you were Winston Smith his old other kettle of fish but anyway goes to the Dallas County Jail in thing was April 64 to examine Ruby in preparation for not the Warren Commission testimony when she was giving in a couple months before his next trial cuz he had you got a new or an appeal for a psychiatric review and West who had told Sidney Gottlieb and in these early letters from the 50s that part of his experiments were inducing insanity and a person without their awareness West goes to examine Ruby emerges from the county jail and there's press weight for him and he announces that within the preceding 48 Hours Ruby had had a psychotic break that was a irrevocable couldn't he couldn't return to sanity he had audio and visual hallucinations during the exam he said Ruby hit under a table cuz he thought they were people in the room trying to kill him told Weston he could hear children's screams outside his jail cell as juice children as they were boiled alive and West said he's completely insane that was the day I mean there was no evidence of Ruby being mentally ill prior to West exam West was alone with him in the cell and then treated him for about six months when Ruby finally gave his testimony the Warren Commission so Earl Warren chief justice Warren who was head of the commission down the Dallas with Joe Ford who is Congressman and on the commission and Arlen Specter the young while inspector who was an investigator for the Warren Commission to eventually came up with the magic bullet theory he called it the Magic Bullet anyway on the three of them Ruby Underoath and Ruby battle was incoherent grabbed on inspector who was like him. cities that don't you know that killing Jews and and that they've killed my brother and cut off his legs I hear them being tortured outside my other good news anyting West that was one of his objectives and his uncal to research was to make people into sinsanity without a person's awareness was there any contact with Jack Ruby before he killed I won't again that was one of the things I can't tell you how hard give me Western movie anyone anyone could have done something to get out to kill to organized crime and federal he was part of which later emerged the anti-castro Cubans effort to overthrow Fidel Castro which was Ron it was Operation Mongoose by the CIA with an illegal assassination program Ruby tonight in the book I found out that we can through West papers that I got access to Ruby admitted never that he stalked and killed Oswald on the orders of anyone but that he was working with these people who were suspected of being involved in the assassination if there was a conspiracy and he had never admitted that to anyone it's only an in West file and West with how that the the the primary theory of who was responsible if there was a conspiracy to kill Kennedy and one of the thoughts was that it had to do with some sort of us CIA operation to overthrow Castro yeah well there was that by John F Kennedy was second-in-command to judge Warren on the commission Richard Helms who was actually Jolly West employer for MKUltra was the liaison between the CIA and the commission so Helms new that Ruby who they call their most important witness in their investigation the Warren Commission investigation because he was the one who silenced the killer there could be no trial for Oswald cuz he was dead so they try to learn everything they could about Ruby to see if he had had any meetings with Oswald prior if he had connections Beyond The Superficial ones to organized crime was there something deeper the commission which I believe was you know a joke from the beginning it was set to determine mean they said in the beginning their objective was to prove that Oswald acted alone they came up with that conclusion but after the first Intelligence Center in what is hearings in the in the early 70s that exposed MKUltra chaos cointelpro primarily that the Frank Church hearings are they found out that fellows and Helms and others had lied about the cia's involvement with Oswald and and with their own agents who have had these peripheral will not their peripheral not but definitely encounters with Oswald they withheld all that so the house voted to have they call the house select committee on assassinations that began in 77 and 78 they released a report which they concluded that was all a probable conspiracy to kill Kennedy that Oswald didn't act alone and you know it's there's lots of books about that and in their findings and then later the to the head of the committee Robert Blakely wrote a book where he said that that Ruby had acted on behalf of The Conspiracy to silence Oswald that he had stalked him premeditated the murder and that the whole thing was part of keeping the secret so was West apart of that and you know again I can't prove it I wanted to find out if what I said had any encounter or any interaction with Ruby prior to Ruby committing the murder couldn't find that and that's the kind of thing that maybe no evidence maybe it happened but there's no evidence but I wasn't going to put it in the book and I exhausted every resource I had you know cuz that that one is always been so puzzling for me cuz here's this guy that's not connected to the murder allegedly and then steps forward and shoots Oswald in front of everybody in himself mean like there's no doubt about it and you're the guy who did it go to jail forever report which was fabricated by his first lawyer who admitted this years and years later he told Ruby to say he did it to spare Jackie Kennedy from having to come to Dallas for a trial of Oswald that was made up and then Melvin Bell I was assigned to the case was I mean really fired like three lawyers in the first couple weeks and I took over and took it to trial and his argument was that he had had an epileptic fit and didn't know what he was doing when he was grabbed by the cops after he shot Oswald he said hey I'm Jack Ruby what what am I doing here what are you doing to me don't you know who I am cuz he knew all the cops my argument of my book is this important my most important finding is that a CIA contracted agent or researcher for mind control became the most important witness to the Warren Commission he came this is doctor right before he testified and told his story I go that should have been disclosed obviously to the commission but they're not going to say it cuz it's a secret program and then he goes crazy crazy by a couple of people who were nobody on the commission would talk to me that was alive when I started pursuing them Joel Ford wouldn't talk to me or I think I mentioned that to you before there's an interesting I approached inspector who was running for re-election this was 2002 and told him I had new information and he had all he had always maintained you know he would he made a lot of money off of his books about Justice and hit in the magic video defending is magic bullet bullet theory he always said if anybody comes to me with new evidence I'll look at it with no open mind so I had sent him a persuasive letter while his people they finally said all right if you have these documents showing this is Doctor Who treated Ruby you know within the 24 hours he lost his mind Specter will look at them and then decide if I'll talk to you fax them to us and at that point that was 2002 I lost a magazine story and I didn't have a book deal so I was operating entirely on my own I said I can't send this stuff to you because it's my Smoking Gun the letters between got leading and why scribing off the experiments so finally Spectre agreed to talk to me on the phone for a few minutes and it was amazing he called me from the senate floor while they were waiting to vote on whether or not they were going to invade Iraq this is 2002 so we were only supposed to talk for a few minutes and when I explained what I had and what it showed West had you know been involved with at the time he treated Ruby he said well if you're not going to send the stuff to me I don't know you know I need to see it and I go well I can't send it to you and he said where you want to meet me cuz I told him I was in Philadelphia visiting my folks and he he was from Philadelphia to he says I'm there in the weekend I'll meet you Saturday I have a squash game at the Wyndham Hotel meet me there squash so we had a meeting set up for like 3 days later and this is something I'm always second-guessing about I made a decision I don't think I got to I don't think I've ever really got paranoid doing this but it's factory been a long-term Senator he was running for re-election and it was the first time in his career but the polls were against him that his opponent was they were predicting that he was going to Spectre was going to lose he had also you know defended this magic bullet theory forever I mean more people knowing for the Kennedy assassination than anything else I thought so if I do meet with him and I show him these documents Maybe diosa me too I thought he's going to go my God I need to be part of their you know exposure cuz if he didn't and walked away from it I thought they were important enough that he would know that that would you know once they were publicized and he had the opportunity to say hey we need to look into this and didn't he was like bass and I thought well maybe he's going to two things he's either going to use it for to get publicity have a press conference and help him in his re-election or he's going to use it to be the hero of it and run with it before I publish the book and then I'll just be a footnote you know to all those cuz he took it so I cancelled the meeting the morning of I called up his press secretary and his cell phone like the three phones I have for my said you have to tell Senator Specter I am so sorry but there's an emergency I've got to go back to Los Angeles actually was scheduled to go the day after on Sunday so it's a lie and I didn't talk to anyone I just left a message and I said I'm so sorry but I obviously I've worked so hard to get this meaning it's embarrassing but I have to go back so I left my parents place to go to the post office cuz I've been there for three months I was actually writing the first version to proposal at their place to get away from my friends and you know all the distractions in LA and I was only going for like 15 minutes ago mom if that press secretary calls I told him I was leaving till tell him that I'm I just went to the airport and I and I apologize so I can't lie to a press secretary I got to go to the Post Office and I come home 15 minutes later she's like this why does it goes I go watch Senator Specter called himself he wanted to know what happened why you changed your mind so I don't know if that was a mistake on my part I think you know 20/20 hindsight I should have done it and taking my chances I did all those what that would have done come up with that whack iron without ya ya ya and the fact that never gets brought up if there were more bullet fragments in Connelly's body then there were missing from that bullet in the fact that anyone who knows anything about guns and if anyone has ever shot a gun as seen with a bullet went on what it looks like wood look at that f****** bullet and think that bullet went through to human beings Siri in the first place is because the guy was hit by a Ricochet on the underpass don't know the whole story behind that I did I tried not to lose myself anymore than I had two in each compartmentalize area I was going to so with the Kennedy assassination I just did a superficial like Manson I was never interested in any thing so called conspiracies yeah I never cared about Kennedy or that's was connected to Ruby and again that was a moment that I was like oh no I mean first it was West in the CIA and then I'm like and Ruby how can I not look at the Kennedy assassination so I kept my focus narrowly just on Ruby Oswald West Spectre I look a little bit of the Magic Bullet and agree with you but I never did a deep dive into a lot of that stuff first it was West in the CIA and then I'm like 10 Ruby how can I not look at the Kennedy assassination so I kept my focus narrowly just on Ruby Oswald West Spectre I look a little bit of the Magic Bullet and agree with you but I never did a deep dive into a lot of that stuff</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I would do without Iowa seduce people into the story and get them as I would love to. I was like pretend I'm a guy and you trying to pitch me this book in the beginning of the first years just that the trial that had occurred that have been prosecuted by Vincent bugliosi had a lot of malfeasance in it by the prosecution I was able to document that they planted former prosecutor on the defense team to sabotage the defense I doubt that two or three of the principal Witnesses including Terry Melcher who played a big part in this and will probably talk about that at some point lied on the stand you know supporting themselves and in a murder trial and if you commit perjury in a murder trial you could be convicted of murder I mean you could be sentenced to a motor if you get up at murder sentence to because of that so there was about a thousand of those and none of them happened all at once. surgery during a murder trial you could be sentenced for murder for the same amount of time that someone would get sentence if they murdered somebody are subject to an actual Capital you could be elected you could be sent to the chair wow and the five people who were convicted of murder in the first trial once had I been around and able to prove this in the early 70s Vincent bugliosi and the three people who lied on the stand in a material way you know I'm a very important way they all could have been tried for that perjury and sentenced to the same or given the same sentence of the people who have gotten the Destin I told you that I just got to the 11 chapter of your book right and essentially what I'm getting so far I haven't finished the book what I'm getting so far is there was some sort of a CIA program where they were explain how they did it they they infiltrated these hippie communities and they allow Charles Manson over and over and over again to get out of jail they knew that he was committing all these crimes and instead of an operating careful required for the first year after Manson was released from prison and 19s Rodgers Matthew and he was a criminologist in the Bay Area Manson violated his parole the day that he was released in Los Angeles and this is one of the you think it's a little lie but it's an important lie that been fully OC presented not just a trial but also in his book a trial it's much more serious he change the narrative he said Manson have been given permission to try San Francisco from La when Manson was paroled meth and hadn't been giving that promotion he just showed up there they originally were going to violate them set them right back to prison and someone stepped in and took care of that and let Madison stay in San Francisco and he was assigned to Rodger Smith it took about a year-and-a-half but through a Freedom of Information Act process I got his Federal parole file and those with a kind of seeds of how I found out that Manson has its immunity prosecution for the two years he was out of prison from 67 until the murders occurred in the Summer of 69 who was Smith doing this for who was giving him the instructions to continue to let Manson out and they needed a modern well that's a problem I didn't get the whole file and the file I got had weird actions he would report to the head office and they would give him instructions and then he would violate those instructions and there be no repercussions for him Warframe Manson for instance Manson was arrested in July of 1967 three or four months after you got out of prison when he was under by Christmas supervision for interfering with an officer who was trying to arrest one of his first young followers Ruth Ann moorehouse who was 15 and he was put in jail plead out so he got a 3-day sentence a new probation sentence as well all that was hidden like this not believe she's booked the parole officer Rodger Smith a week later wrote to the head office at Mattson was doing fine and he actually recommended that Manson be allowed to go to Mexico and work in Mexico and the head parole office in the United States census Federal wrote back and they said that's insane he was supposed the job that he was going to do in Mexico was surveying soil for insect insect the size and they had nothing to do with it documents showing the who is hiring Charles Manson to survey soil it was a company and Nevada which disappeared a couple years later it was a b******* company's I believe so yeah 1959 the last time he free man he had violated his parole then he was arrested in Mexico right he was arrested in Mexico and brought over by the federales and and given over to Federal custody for I was a drug violation and then some other stuff so why would his parole officer send them back to this place three months after he been released and how do you supervise somebody who's in another country can I make a summary just for people who like what the f*** is going on right now what you're saying is that Charles Manson was a part of some sort of a program yes and that through this program they were using him and using but with LSD and all the members of the family they were turning them violent and why why do you think they were doing this together so I got to reel it in a little about not saying anything that I have been able to prove what I proven is if he was getting leniency from the federal government and the law enforcement first in San Francisco that year the person who represented the federal government there was his parole officer Rodger Smith Federal parole officer was getting him leniency Rodger was also doing drug research at the Haight-Ashbury free medical clinic which opened in June of 67 Manson during that period turned the Manson that were familiar with today you know the monster the embodiment of evil as been fully OC call them the guru who could control the minds of these followers so he would come into the clinic to see Rogers when he went for two reasons but it was a free clinic it was at the height of the summer of love summer of 67 and he will come in with a women two girls here about five or six followers then and they would walk behind them they wouldn't speak unless he spoke to them the man he issued towards then they would follow and they became very well known around the clinic and they were there principally for Manson to see Rodger for his weekly parole appointments and then the girls were going in for STDs and there was some pregnancies and stuff never getting free treatment that was the summer that the Manson family formed and then they left in late 67 early 68 and migrated down to Los Angeles and became is Killer caught it's crazy how quickly this all happened it's insane in Haight-Ashbury 69 the tate-labianca murders and then the trial and then everything else was basically just sort of a two-bit criminal who would spend most of his life inside the system and had been incarcerated for what half of his life his life when he was released about 8:32 and 67 off Federal institutions to which was interesting even pelillos he pointed that out in his book first of all his mother was a prostitute kind of she would get sent to jail for petty theft or prostitution and she had them off to her parents or other people and by the time he was 10 11 12 years old he was stealing cars committing petty theft and stuff so that he was sent to adult detention centers in schools reform schools are run by the federal government and then when he committed his first crimes as an adult which was again car theft the first crimes require that but when he stole the cars across state lines so then it became a federal offense and he got in prison but with much more serious sentences if it's a federal offense in if it's state and he do these long sentences back-to-back-to-back and then every time he was released he either violated parole and probation and they were actually strict with him in the 50s and early well still 60 when he finally went to prison for 7 years it wasn't until 67 when he came out that all the sudden with hands off and what do you think happened in prison did they find him in prison again I'll go there with you okay which we know was a good possibility as I lay out circumstantial evidence for a case with proof of each circumstance but when you put them all together that's the hardest part is linking them finding the bridges what I do is show what the objectives were either the federal government's case to MKUltra than other programs cointelpro and it and chaos and the enforcement in Los Angeles and San Francisco at the time so MK Ultra began in the in the federal prisons experiments on prisoners famously or notoriously Whitey Bulger I don't know if you heard about this but a few years ago it was revealed that Whitey Bulger had been apart of MK Ultra experimentation the fifties when he was incarcerated and after he was convicted he was claiming that he believed that all of his violence was a product of what it happened to him in prison when he was experimented upon with LSD through these scientists so theoretically Manson was in the pine place where the experiments were occurring in prison before he was released in 67 in federal institutions they couldn't do it in the state of Mo is federal parole file which was an accident never been released from 67 to 69 but I also have the one prior to that from the 50s and the 60s and all the correspondence and he would talk about these doctor's coming in to examine him and he didn't trust them and didn't know what they were doing and this was late 50s and unfortunately he never had the first names for the doctors over to one of them was dr. Hartman I can remember the other one's name that was in Hartman in Los Angeles who was one of the early psychiatrist using LSD and in the 50s Cary Grant was one of his patient so theoretically he could have come out of the program or the experimentation that began there but you know I hate to even I rather all this without showing all the documentation and stuff what was going on where he was and how everything matches up but you see that when you get through chapter 11 okay so far so 1967 he gets out of jail and he how long before he hooks up with this clinic so he got out in March of 67 the clinic open in June of 67 so just a few months it Will Rogers Smith he was a living in Berkeley Manson was and he got his first follower Mary Brunner and then two or three or four more and then Rodger was the one who suggested that he go to the hate to absorb The Vibes he thought Manson my benefit from the love and peace five that were happening in the Summer of Love Smith was his parole officer in 67 that gal Sedalia told me she was his assistant at the clinic at the Haight-Ashbury free medical clinic when he was running his amphetamines study in in 68 she said that Rodger had told her he met Manson when he was doing probation work and Illinois and the early sixties eventually interview Rodger several times and Rodger denied that and when I went back to jail she doxycyc I can't believe he's denying that that was a connection here. That's why I meant was able to leave Los Angeles he was sent to Rodger Smith so Rodger could be his parole officer I was never able to document that Benson had been in Illinois except for 3 days for in 61 or excuse me in 60 when he was brought from Mexico to Texas and then they brought him to Los Angeles to be violated in front of the judge there he did spend free days at Joliet prison where Rodger Smith work but he was there a year or two later know that was one of the one of the many frustrating moments where everything makes sense except for one but one very important whole which was will they weren't there at the same time at least as far as the official record shows so if Smith was a part of these experiments in Smith was also his parole officer and did know him before he did this 10 years before he got out which is when it's speculated that Manson was possibly experimented on and Smith might have been aware of the entire process of it and was supervising him upon his release they would just let him go and give you a little background on Smith is he told me he called himself he goes I was at Rock rib republican from the Midwest and I came out he went to Berkeley to the school of criminology to become a criminologist I think I'm 65 or 66 he was getting his master's and his PhD and his special area of study was in the beginning gangs Collective behavior and violence and then how drugs would make some of these gangs that he had people he was working with infiltrate students infiltrate mention that this isn't an Oakland in the ghettos and in like 6566 on the Panthers were forming then and 6866 he decided to become a federal parole officer while he was still writing his dissertation and he got assigned to something called the San Francisco project which was an experimental program run by the federal government to see how different numbers of parole clients caseloads for parole officer where you know supervision it was about recidivism so if you had the lowest low was 20 clients the largest was like 50 or 60 were you able to supervisor you wouldn't think that 50 or 60 is going to be a lot more difficult but it always wasn't so Smith join that program where he's supposed to be paying much more attention and care to his clients because are the special program called the San Francisco project and in fact you was I mean he was he was seeing Manson more than he was even officially supposed to thinks he's stopping his parole officer was actually removed and he said it was voluntarily so he could focus more on his drugs and violence research at the clinic Manson three or four women followers got arrested in Mendocino they had lured a cup young boys into a house giving them LSD they're advancing it sent them out up to Mendocino to recruit people for the family the three women were four women were arrested one of the Mary Brunner had the first baby with Manson in the group and Rodger Smith and his wife Carol went up to Mendocino and petition the court to take Foster custody of the child until Mary was until her case was resolved so they were the foster parents of Manson's son I mean nothing was irregular about this that actually that case is pretty interesting so Mary Brunner and Susan Atkins two women who actually killed for Manson in 1969 were given they were convicted of contributing to the delinquency of minors illegal drug possession and without a trial a plat out and then there was what they called the sentencing phase where a probation officer is assigned to decide whether or not they should the prison are given probation supervised probation so I got access to their files Brunner's and Atkins and in the file with recommendations to the core by Rodger Smith and his wife saying these are good women they shouldn't go to prison Susan Atkins who you know stab Sharon Tate and is that proven cuz she said it and then we went back and forth and back and forth murder she couldn't do it but this was later on that she did it and then when she testified to the grand jury she said that she didn't do it she held Sharon while text abdur later in prison she said that she did do it then she changed again she go back and forth that she was pretty brutal and probation instead of sentence partially based on Rodger Smith recommendation Rodger Smith identified himself as a form of parole officer you know what this expertise and he said he had known both of them for two years and which was also a lie I had only known Susan could have known Susan for 2 years but he knew her for about a year he did not marry pretty well and he never disclosed that he was Manson's parole officer a Manson hide in the same files as the person who lured these women into crimes that they were his communal wives that they would steal for him prostitutes themselves for him and the other people that they interviewed the probation officer are good against it saying they're going to go right back to this guy who's down in Los Angeles and continue the life of crime but the judge released them what they were trying to do was people into the family so they would offer them drugs and and and sacks and lot of women and bring them to these parties and where they screwed up is they got an underage boy who was Rick out right and he was the son of a sheriff so many of these instances where Charlie or members of the family were arrested and then it seems like the police officers who were holding them we're being told hey you got to let these guys go the others this is a higher the situation is above your paygrade and saw that I mean I think describes to arrest that Manson released on a technicality you know the shoddy police work or something when he should have been violated but what he didn't do was talk about three or four more and if you've got enough to chapter 10 you seen all that stuff laid out so when I got this record of a pretty substantial record I took it to someone in Lewis walk neck who was a retired judge and retired district attorney from the valley at around here Van Nuys cuz I needed somebody with the expertise and the knowledge how things work have to look at everything in context things work out differently today than they did in 2009 or 2100 him but he was there and 69 in the DA's office I brought the documents to him and we lay them all out on his kitchen table and he's looking at them in the poor guy was very sick with cancer and the recorder going and he's looking at all the documents and he's seeing this pattern of catch release catch release chickenshit chickenshit this is all chickenshit because he shouldn't he should have gone back the first time because they wanted him out he said he thought he was more important to somebody out than in he goes you got to find out who it was and I go out how do I do that and go you're not going to be able to that's using informant I go but who should I what should I look at because what he was working either for local law enforcement the federal government the FBI somebody wanted him out there doing whatever he was doing so that was important another turning point was a bunch of years later was when I brought similar materials to Steven K who was blue Yoshi's co-prosecutor in the case was an informant that's not just informing on crime and also can be doing the police's bidding that's where the CIA are the FBI part of a program where they're allowing this and also there's speculation that the the goal was to try to diminish the anti-war movement and that this guy was a part of the hippie movement and then so now people with associate hippies with violence and drugs and murder and all this horrific stuff and also there's speculation that the the goal was to try to diminish the anti-war movement and that this guy was a part of the hippie movement and then so now people with associate hippies with violence and drugs and murder and all this horrific stuff</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> so you brought up MK Ultra MK Ultra was a government program run by the Central Intelligence Agency originally started as something called Blue Bird and 1948-49 morph into artichoke and then in 1952 became MKUltra was a mind control program a brainwashing program the CIA was trying to learn how to control people's behavior without their knowledge now this is all came Senate and Congressional hearings in the 70s that was exposed but nobody knew about it until 1974 when Seymour Hersh the New York Times Reporter ever put it on the front page of the paper so their main objective was to commit to create what they called Hypno programmed assassins people who would kill on command popularly known as with Manchurian candidates after a book that was written 1962 and later became a movie movie again the people would be through drugs and hypnotism the objective was to get people to go and commit an act of murder against their moral code and have no memory of their programming and be amnesic even of the ACT after-the-fact often that was just one of those are mango but they were also trying to create careers people you know military people that they couldn't plant messages send them you know dangerous areas where they were at that time was the Vietnam War and deliver messages and then have them wipe from their remember in case they were captured that all kinds of objectives so Rodger Smith was supervising Manson when he became exactly what are he was able to do exactly what the mk-ultra program have been trying to create and do for at that point about 15 17 years when it was off supposed in the seventies and there were these hearings first the Rockefeller commission hearings and the church hearings and then finally Senator Ted Kennedy and Daniel anyway held hearings the CIA admitted that they had done this but they know one would say exactly what they did all the records have been destroyed when the two people who ran it Richard Helms would become the director of the CIA in the sixties and dr. Sidney Gottlieb who was kind of the mad scientist 2 had supervised doll that all the plants safe houses in San Francisco New York Los Angeles where they would experiment on people that were lured into these apartments and houses that were either look like brothels or hippie communes or whatever and the people who are working at the Haight-Ashbury free medical clinic that was run by another Smith which makes it a little confusing but dr. David Smith who founded it he had given and what's to a scientist name Jolly West Louis J West who was when when the killings occurred in the seventies identified as a top and kale to researcher he was an academic come out of the military have been at the University of Oklahoma University at University of Oklahoma sorry and that UCLA running psychiatric division he denied ever being involved in MK Ultra and this was one of the moment. 2001 when you know things really kind of shook the course of my reporting was I learned that West had been at the same place of Manson was in the hate in the summer that Manson became exactly what the CIA was trying to create and I knew lactide interviewed West about 7 years before for a story I did about celebrity stalkers with people who are obsessed with scars and then only to kill them or try to kill them is an expert and violence hypnotism brainwashing and he was a chair of the Psychiatry department at UCLA at that point he was dead when his name came up in the Manson story and there wasn't a lot of I mean I guess it was a lot of Google then or a little bit when I did a little research I found out that there been these allegations that he been involved in MKUltra he always denied it he was never prosecuted never even investigated he went to his grave threatening to sue anybody that said he would have anything to do kind of a program again through another long story but I got access to his files which is been left at UCLA and never been never been processed when I called and went when I made the request it took him two or three months to process the papers I went through them to the whole summer looking for a needle in a haystack and it was intuition God I just thought there might be something there and sure enough I eventually found it it was correspondence between Jolly West and Sidney Godley doctor that ran MK Ultra beginning in 1953 about Kentucky conducting experiments on people without their knowledge to get them to have a musics Asia of the ax after they were programmed and everything that he had been accused of and denied he did not only did he do it he created the blueprint for the whole program of God lead the fact that all these kind of interesting research problems emerged at the hate at the clinic and then Manson came out of it with the power to do exactly what the mk-ultra have been trying to create up to that point I thought was worth investigating further and that's why I kept going and going and going and a lot of crazy s*** back then do you wear of operation would like midnight climax that does with the safehouse play Lordi John's and fees brothels and then dose them up with LSD and studied them yeah George Hunter white was ahead CIA get guy and he would sit behind a two-way or one-way mirror and watch the the John's will be dosed with LSD they try to aerosol or just drinks different things and then they would study their behaviors aerosol sprays play The Wreckers are so scat because Helms order gotlib to destroy all the records in 1973 when the two men left the agency and the only reason anybody ever discovered that it existed was a whistle-blower somebody who used to work for the state department who remembered that there were records in a warehouse and they were just Financial records from the beginning of the program and 52 until the end and the possible and in 73 and it was just Financial records of where research took place how much was spent what kind of equipment was bought but nothing about the content the guy that found that ended up testifying to Congress and working with Seymour Hersh to expose it was named John Marks he wrote the first book about MKUltra that came out in the mid-to-late seventies called The Search for The Manchurian Candidate and after he wrote his book he never you know he spoke to the little bit of a tour and then retreated Into Obscurity and never would do an interview again until I approached them in the early 2000s and when I told him what I had what I had found West files these documents he agreed to meet with me at his townhouse in Washington DC and he told me he said the reason I stopped talking or writing about this is people were camping out on my front lawn you know telling me that they've been victims of MKUltra because I couldn't go anywhere in my whole life became crazy cuz everybody thought that they were subject to this cuz nobody knew they did these drug test on prisoners hospital patients John's hippies people that had no idea this was going on for 25 years so marks became the authority so he had never given an interview till he met with me and when he looked at my documents at that point I think I had about 10 or 12 or 15 pages that grew eventually cuz I kept going back to the files and get him or he said it was the unredacted uncensored account of what the real objectives were and what was really being done had never he said if I had had that my whole book would have been different so that's one of the problems about saying how much did they do or how far did they go there's barely any record and that's another reason it took me 20 years cuz I was trying to find out whether or not West it actually interacted with Manson and was a girls I know he was in the same facility I know that everybody that work there cuz I interviewed everybody that was a lie there most of them were still alive back in the late 90s early 2000s when I did this they all said oh yeah Charlie was eating them we knew it was Charlie in the girls they come in every day or every few days to see Rodger and and West was their recruiting subjects now west while he was there that summer had opened something called what he called the Haight-Ashbury project and in his correspondence and papers that I found he called it a laboratory disguise as a hippie crash pad and and just like the operation midnight safe how they calm safe houses which were disguises Bethea Cordello's and that type of thing or brothels these this was an apartment that was decked out or is he called a tricked-out to look like a communal hippie places six graduate students and I have his letters to them before they came to does grow your hair long wear jeans dress like hippies and lure people in there so they ran that for the summer of 67 and West was getting people from that Haight-Ashbury free medical clinic on Clayton Street and sending them around the corner to Frederick Street to participate in that and and they said idea what we're really supposed to be doing here we feel like this whole thing as a cover for something else what is Jolly want why is he making us bring these people in so I can do to bring people in and drugged programming go on to do legitimate work the ethical foundations of your career or set up in such a strange wife you're manipulating people against their knowledge will they didn't know who they were doing it for that's why they were always questioning at so you know I don't know how I found one or two of them after and they were very careful talking to me I'm sure that yeah that there's no statute of limitations on murder right I mean that's one of the biggest disappointments of my book is that people like West aren't alive you know that to answer for that to answer this and it was really frustrating for me because his name was on the front page of the New York Times in 1977 when they had the major hearings about MKUltra and it identified him as the head of the Psychiatry department at UCLA very prominent doctor researcher and he said he had nothing to do with that he never used LSD on humans and he wouldn't he said they had asked him and he said no I have all these letters between him and the guy who was running the program describing how they're going to do it hide it from his colleagues when he started at he started at Lackland Air Force Base he was running the Psychiatry department at the hospital there 1952 when he was there running that hospital that's when he started his prisoners human subjects and one letter to Gottlieb he says eventually we have to take these experiments out to the field of Jesus exactly does that mean well if you haven't gotten it through a chapter 11 yet you haven't gone to the Jimmy shaver a year after maybe Jamie did a year after I was contracted with the CIA to do these experiments July 4th 1950 for 3 year old girl went missing from the parking lot of a bar at about 11 or 12 at night and her parents with a heatwave they couldn't sleep they went to the bar they brought their two kids they let them play in the parking lot at midnight the little girl disappeared they organize a search party about three or four hours later they went to a gravel pit and two Arrow to Airmen itinerant guys had called the police the local sheriff and said there's a guy here that wandered out of the brush with scratches and blood no shirt and he doesn't know how he got here who he is the police came his name was Jimmy shaver he was in Harriman they did a search and they found a little girl's body not too far away and she had been raped and murdered by this guy who had no memory of doing it the guy no History of Violence had a couple kids and he was a flight instructor at the school he been in the military for a number of years I think it was in his early 30s well guess who became his psychiatrist in preparation for the trial Jolly West who inserted himself into the case and then extracted his memory from him using sodium pentathol where he admitted to the the murderer now in the context of what we found out west was doing and what is detectives were at that same time it raises huge questions about this was an experiment gone wrong you know that he was part of one of these experiments at Lackland Air Force Base where he was signed up during the trial it came out that he had had treatment for severe migraines experimental treatment at Lackland that's another you know smaller subchapter in the book but is it described what kind of experimental treatment he received nobody I mean I have all the testimony of there was actually a treat a trial or jury trial and sentencing and every time it came up it was really frustrating because he never testified so that it was either his wife or his mother who would talk about it was mostly his mother saying well all I knew it was they wanted him to be involved in this two years study to try to relieve his his migraines he would have such horrible migraines he would put his head in bucket of ice water the people who described encountering him that night when he was arrested and immediately taken out of the sheriff's custody by the military police and brought the Lachlan and then back to the Sheriff's he was in a trance the doctors tested him for alcohol cuz he's drunk Uno out just a little bit of alcohol in the system but he wasn't drunk and after the fact they found out that he had I don't want to get into this cuz it's really getting into the weeds but he had hallucinated that this little girl was a cousin who sexually abused him as a child and he was trying to kill her name was Beth rainbow all the stuff came out at the trial Jolly West in 1955 send a report to Sidney Gottlieb which nobody had seen it was another document I found in his files and now it's saying that he had learned how to develop the technology to remove true memories and replace them with false memories and a human subject without their knowledge which was one of the main goals the biggest goals of the MKUltra program it again when the CIA when they have the hearings in the 70s the CIA said nothing was successful everything we try was a failure it was a waste of money we shouldn't have done it and most experts think that that was a cover that they didn't want to admit they that they had developed these technologies that were effective they also claimed that they had released everything they had I found the same report where West said that he had learned how to replace true memories with false ones without a person's awareness but they had remove that from the report and then release it to Congress so that's a crime right there you know there's a lot of that stuff in the book is that this guy through these experimental treatments that they do stuff up with LSD and experimented using these MKUltra techniques and did that to him and then do some sort of this is speculation. I'll go there a History of Violence never been arrested upstanding citizen is only problem with these horrible headaches and he shows up by a small girl's body who been brutally murder with no memory of doing it a year earlier doctor West who became a psychiatrist within a week or two possibly had experiences with them before but there was no record when I try to get the record from the medical center at Lackland his file his name was shaver I think it was essay was missing so where shaver would have been in the medical records it was gone so I couldn't find out whether he'll actually participated in any kind of experimental program that so is the speculation the Genesis speculation that he did commit the crime that he was somehow another induced into committing this crime will go out and do things not even necessarily what to do things against their will against their moral Cody but how would they know that this child would be there how would they do know she wasn't targeted so was it just that they put it into his head to go and downplay anyone was one of the Premier Research new to it he had actually come out of here first gained national attention for being one of four or five doctors who treated Korean prisoners of War who were returned to the United States after they had made confessions of spraying the Korean Countryside with you legal biological weapons the United States so that we don't use that that's against the Geneva codes and these guys were brainwashed by the North Korea Chinese Soviets so when they were brought back after the war West and four other psychiatrists were assigned to de-program them what a lot of researchers believe is that they actually brainwash them into thinking they've been brainwashed by the Koreans where they actually were telling the truth because there's a lot of evidence has come out as recently as 5-6 years ago that we did use these weapons in Korea is that they actually brainwash them into thinking they've been brainwashed by the Koreans where they actually were telling the truth because there's a lot of evidence has come out as recently as 5-6 years ago that we did use these weapons in Korea double cross</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> other big eye opener for what's kept from us at one point 2011 I had a researcher at the Washington Post a woman there who has been there for years so I can get myself in trouble for this to I won't say her name but anyway she's very well known and she's their intelligence researcher she works with all of the reporters at the post on intelligence stories National Security stories and she had someone at the CIA fashion Department who would confirm or deny stuff with her and she said I completely trust these people I've been working with him for 10 years I'll ask them about Jolly West and see what they have on them and I said before you ask them don't tell them cuz she had the documents I share them with her don't tell them what I have proven that he was part of MKUltra just say you're working with an author of the book who wants to know whether there cuz I redone request we can neither confirm nor deny then she said they don't they'll tell me the truth like they're not going to give you another confirm or deny we'll just say we have something and we can't tell you if we can or we have nothing but we'll get the truth to see what they have so a week later she lets me know and she said they said there's nothing he never participated in the program there's no record and I go up and want to say her name I go well I don't think you should be using them anymore because they're not liable and you know that cuz you've seen the documents so she we think that I don't know we know what you did after that's the way they can embed themselves with reporters by letting me know that I'm your friend like I'll tell you the truth it's a complicated world where I keep people safe discuss three Woodson he's the guy that claim to it he'll infiltrator the Manson family no no no no is that after 11 chapters are there 13 including the apologue yeah yeah yeah what's a spook and unfortunately was dead by the time I start a record I wasn't interested listen to some of his close friends he lives in Los Angeles and then he disappear for months doing undercover work and he said we never he would even tell us who we work for but his wife and daughter who were in Sweden and other people who said it was a CIA he told before he died a couple years before his death three or four of his closest friends including his attorney that he had worked on an operation and he wouldn't tell them who but he had infiltrated the Manson family prior to the murders and it was. His dying regret was he could have prevented them but didn't he also said that he was at the crime scene after the killers had left before the police had arrived which was like a four or five-hour window and I was able to confirm not that he was there those five hours but that he was missing and that the police set up watch at his father's house he was living with the try to figure out what was going on he ended up helping Colonel taejon Tate's father who left his job in Military Intelligence to help police in the investigation even dressed up like a hippie dress up like a hippie and soda Reeve and Ray was a really hardcore right-wing guy I mean he was racist and and his daughter sent me pictures of him and she said once he dies in fact this is how serious this guy was he divorce read divorced his wife was a Swedish model first he sent her and his infant daughter back to Sweden from the United States in 61 cuz he thought there was going to be nuclear war and then in the mid-sixties he told his wife he had to divorce her and he couldn't have any relationship with his daughter because his daughter this is only vulnerability because of the work he did that would be how they heard even if they lived all the way in Sweden so the daughter Liza who I've never met but we started talking on the phone and she started sending me materials didn't meet him until a couple years before his death he reached out to her that I couldn't have any relationship with you because of my work but I want to do that now so he Florida Los Angeles introduced her to all of his friends and he died she went to his apartment and went through his things and found a picture of him dressed up as a hippie it's in the book and I mean it's hard to tell but it's in the parking lot and the cars are always late 60s models so this is one of the parts of the book where I work so hard to try to prove that the definite link interview probably 12 or 13 Manson family members and I show them that picture and they say he look like any number of guys you look like any number of guys that that came in and out of there they come for a day to screw us women would say Charlie would bring guys in and we didn't know if they were the ones we're providing drugs or who they were but yeah maybe or maybe not you know and they were all high most of the time too</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> the block there's a murder in there that I think the Manson family committed that was covered up by the law enforcement cuz it's screwed up it would have screwed up the prosecution I want that looked into there's also at the end of the book there these texts Watson audio tapes that I found out about in 2008 when Watson turned himself in when he found he was alerted and in Texas he was at his parents house so they call the police call the local sheriff who was Texas cousin and his parents and said he's wanted for questioning in is unsalted murders this is November 29th nobody had been identified publicly as suspects the police were just starting to figure out that these people that killed their victims so to LAPD flew down to Texas Watson was brought into the station question by the LAPD put under arrest they had to extradite I'm so that the sheriff there Texas doesn't put them in a Cell the family call up a lawyer Bill boy who would actually Arizona tax on a college case when he stole a typewriter from a college and a prank Bill Boyd told me an interview in 2008 that that day he had text tell him the whole story or Charles is he called him about how he met Manson why the murders were committed how they happen he said he spoke to me for 20 hours and he goes I've got all those audio tapes in a safe in my office he told me that in 2008 he said he also described other murders that the family had committed that hadn't been connected to them so right away when you're on 2009 working on it that long I thought other murders that's important to me but more important did he tell his attorney why the murders really happen you know why they picked those houses you know this was the first account that was recorded the next one was Susan Atkins about a week later after she had gotten her new attorney that the prosecution planted they audio taped her telling her version which became the official version so Watson's would predate that by a week and when I found out that they were in that safe and he's telling me this on the phone I thought he can't play that to me because that would violate Watson's attorney-client privilege but I thought have to ask is there any chance that's what I could come down and listen to those tapes and he said that's when he realized he shouldn't have told me that all will you I couldn't do that without Charlie Charles Watson Charles permission I go you still in touch with me also I write to him every now and then he writes me he didn't represent him a trial after he was extradited and I thought what you please ask so that began three or four months of me pestering and he would never take the phone call and then finally after 4 months I call open the secretaries and I'm sorry mr. Boys in China on business today and I said what you have to tell him I'm not going to wait anymore I'm going to write to Charles and tell him what he told me I go if there's other bodies I mean I didn't let them know that I was more interested in the motive story but I said if I was interested in the other bodies are victims out there who've never been connected or even the remains were because there's a lot of evidence that there might have been people killed out in the desert and buried there I need to know that and she said okay I'll tell him my phone rang like literally 30 seconds after I hung it up and I had caller ID it was from his Texas office cuz this is Billy boy you cannot call Charles and tell him I told you that I sent mr. Boyd you haven't call me back before Monday cuz why I'm telling you now you can't do that I go well are you going to get his permission I can't wait anymore he says if you do that and you tell him I'll deny ever telling you I said it's all on tape you don't have permission to tape that cargo yeah you gave me permission at the beginning and that's on tape to the goddamn they hung up on me bankrupt and then it was until two or three years later and it's all in there the backstory but I finally went to try to get the tapes again and found out he had died found out that the tapes were in the possession of the trustee who was waiting for the bankruptcy to be evolved over resolved and it took me three or four months of back-and-forth and to try to get them to release the tapes to me and I made an argument for why they weren't protected anymore again long story short I was sharing information with the deputy da in Los Angeles who I thought was friendly he was until he wasn't and he was handling all the parole hearings of the Manson family guy named Pat Sakura the woman who was in charge of the tapes the trustee said it's secure calls me and tells me that it's okay for me to release them to you and explain how it's not a violation I'll do it I said Alaskan so I absolutely I want to talk to her and I said great a day later I got a call from security cuz you're not going to believe that she's releasing the tapes to us I know you because you don't worry I'll let you hear him when we got them then I have lost any kind of control and sure enough number one the trustee had to notify Watson's new attorney Watson put up a fight in court and it's in you can read about the other times I reported on that the year for about a year and one from the local Court of the state supreme court for the judge finally ruled that the LAPD should have the tapes they sent two officers down to get the tapes in 2013 they came back and then nobody at the DA's office would talk to me anymore the promise that have been made that I would be the first one to listen to them reneged those tapes a million journalist have made a Freedom of Information Act request for them they won't release them to Locked Up less mountains attorney want some he thinks it'll help her at her parole hearings because he thinks there's information on there to show that you've been telling the truth all these years he's gone to the state supreme court to other courts they block them down 20 hours first account of how and why these murders occurred and they're not releasing them I think it's because the truth is on there information on there to show that you've been telling the truth all these years he's gone to the state supreme court through the other courts they blocked them down 20 hours first account of how and why these murders occurred and they're not releasing them I think it's because the truth is on there</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> is the speculation terms of gliosis connection was he given a narrative was did did you do think that they want to answer that he was compromised when he was given this case in 1969 it's in the book he has family out there but they know about this he was involved in a couple cases the first one before the trial that are crazy I mean when you see the stuff that happened between him and I you know all those years later it makes sense when you see what he was like before he became famous so in 1965 he had his first child Vincent bugliosi junior he decided that he wasn't the father that the Milkman was the father and back in those days you're too young to know people used to deliver milk to home remember hearing about it so he believed that the Milkman was a father he was a whopping coming this Deputy district attorney in Los Angeles and for about I think 12 or 16 months he stalked his Milkman trying to get him to take a blood test to prove that he fathered his wife's child it got so bad that they had to they stop letting their kids take the bus homeschool their two young kids they didn't know who he was he wouldn't tell them who he was all he would say was I was on the Milkman has left the job a month after his wife found out she was pregnant then says why then send his delirium decided that he was fired because he gotten you know clients are people who delivered milk to pregnant so he was writing them Anonymous letters following the kids I actually this is one thing I did hear I heard from the two little girl sent one who's now a grown woman read about this in my book and she sent me a letter and she goes you only got half of it he said he terrorized us he said my father she said my father than what we had a nervous breakdown she said he came to my school and pick me up and and he took me to a toy store bought all these toys me whatever I wanted brought me to the house and he had a driver and he met at the end of the driveway my mom came out and I was like so happy I was like five or six years old I had all these gifts and she goes get into the house getting to the house so what happened was Vince got caught I mean he eventually what was stalking and he sent his wife to the house to beg the milkman's wife to get her husband to do a paternity test and I've done all this from all these civil depositions when it came when the man sued him later Vince that the milkmaid eventually got his brother-in-law to follow them from one of his Steakhouse Pennswoods put the car outside the house he sent them letters like they changed her phone number he goes I noticed you change your phone number that wasn't nice I mean not so the Milkman followed Vance brother-in-law that got the plate number found out who he was and that he was at the DA's office called his personal attorney and the personal attorney called Vince and they meeting between Vince the Milkman the milkman's wife and this is Julio C and then admitted that he had been stalking them because he thought it was his wife here Tuesday as investigators calling this guy a material witness in a murder case to follow him get information private information on Lake big so Vince said he would pay them $100 and never do it again and the Milkman said we don't want your money just never bother us again so that way all about the end of 68 or early 69 the DA's office knew about this he should have been fired immediately instead he gets the biggest case at that point in the history of Los Angeles the tate-labianca trial this is where we get speculative you have a guy like Vince whose compromise he'll do what the hires up tell him to do and if you read in the book Apple younger was a district attorney at the time he was a shady guy who died OSS which was the predecessor to the CIA trained in Espionage don't think too much it's in the book that's where we got speculative it since was answering for something the explanation is because he didn't go into this case clean he had to do what he was told and to this day is the best selling True Crime book of all time and it's a wonderfully written block I mean I could take a page by Page and show your stuff is completely fabricated and made up and that contradicts the real record but you know best seller and that same year then was going to run for district attorney and the Milkman and his wife had never told anyone I guess outside of their family what it happened for 5 before but when I saw that fence was trying to be the most powerful long first person in the city of Los Angeles they went to his opponent and said you need to know this this man cannot get this job so they told the opponent and they had a press conference so the Milkman and his wife went public Vince responded by having his own press conference and telling the reporters here's here's what happened the Milkman We Believe call $300 in cash on my kitchen table when he was on the route so I'm just doing a personal investigation and through reporters that will did you hire let me did you contact the Pasadena Police cuz I know I just wanted to do it on my own and then it's other people pointed out later he was doing this this was 65 he was doing it through the end of 68 the statute of limitations on theft burglary robbery is 3 year it would even if he found out that he had someone the $3 they would have been able to prosecute it so the whole thing went with a live-in slide to the media and he lost the money lost that election then he ran again after Health escape this culture came out for Attorney General of California at that point the Milkman and the wife were going to go public again at the hey we have even more to tell about the Hoosiers I think of what the daughter wants to tell me she actually hasn't gotten in touch with me after the first email I said I want to hear what you have and see she said she's all these. but then a woman named return your car well that she was going to go public to she came out and said excuse me after Vince told the world that the Milkman has stolen $300 for him the Milkman his wife filed a civil suit against pins and Gail his wife because Gail also publicly said with ants in an interview that that's a true that was all about it at this petty theft they sue them for defamation and they settled and then pay them I think it was $12,000 in cash and hundred dollar bills and you know part of the agreement was they weren't allowed to talk about it they couldn't say they've gotten any money and he would only give it in cash so they couldn't trace it to him I ended up getting all the documents that took a long time but I got them then when they went public again when he was running for attorney general they were subject to you know being in violation of that but they said he can't you know them will tell everything he doesn't want to tell he lied under oath and deposition so did his wife about the stalking so in 73 Vince had an affair with a woman named Virginia Cardwell Virginia Cardwell was Catholic she got pregnant she told Vincent that she was pregnant with his child and then said she had to get an abortion and she said I can't get an abortion on the Catholic she was a single mother he said he would set it up he had a doctor it was still illegal and I he he gave her the money to pay the doctor and then he called her and she said she had gotten a abortion everything was fine then he called the doctor violating HIPAA rules the doctor said actually I've never heard from this woman I didn't give her the procedure so Vince went to her house and beat the hell out of her and I've got all those depositions to he he just according to the her Story 2 she reported that he dragged her across the hair about the four by the hair satin her and punched her and punched her again in the face told her she had to get an abortion she miscarried after that episode she went she went to the Santa Monica Police as soon as he left and reported it and nobody would have known about it but the reporter saw it on that you know the police wire service or whatever so the next day it was on the front page of all the LA papers that vents Puleo's he had been accused of battery of a man who said that he wanted her to have an abortion and she wouldn't so Vince went to the police told them she was lying she was a client that he had had one phone consultation with never met her face-to-face and she was trying to embarrass him because he wanted her to pay him two or $300 he defend her like he did the Milkman he he made up a story and worse this time he told that to the police this was an in their investigation of the battery he lied to the police that it did not happen but here's what happened the next day after the newspapers reported it and then said it was a lie and he told the police that Ben's went back to her apartment with his secretary and a typewriter and he held her hostage I know that sounds crazy it's in the book at the end held her hostage for I think three or four hours bagging her and then bullying her like he might hit her then so I can't remember to go to the police and say that she had made the whole story up his secretary was there cuz once he got her to agree to do it she wrote up backdated bill the bill for the money and had Virginia sign it so Virginia finally agreed to go to the police said look you're going to be charged with filing a false report which is a felon it was a misdemeanor but it could go to a felony and you I can take care of all that I've got the connections to the DA's office in Santa Monica what you did and he did take care of it so she called up the Santa Monica Police Department to say she was coming in to report that she had made the story up because she was angry about this money and the cop said right away he knew that something was wrong in the Tremor of her voice is it what kind of got you and Vince was on the other line he said no no no they can't come here this is no no no I'm coming and they said okay we'll see you when you get here and then they dispatched two cops to her apartment now this endeavor in public before I found a did become public about what happened Vince got away with denying it the cop that went to see what was going on in to get her Sunday Michael Landes he was retired in Santa Monica I got his name from the report he said oh yeah pencils at the house he wouldn't let us end he said he and his partner Steinberg were there and she's cowering behind them crying and we got her out of the house prior to the station and she told the the store that it was fake that and he said what we saw him there she goes you have no idea how dangerous he is I didn't I made it up please it was a false report so she got charged the next day's papers reported that this woman to come out and admitted that the whole thing was made up nobody said anything to the cops didn't talk to reporters about fence being at the house and then we know he prevailed he won then when he ran for Attorney General of California and 76 Virginia Cardwell went public and then then said told the same lie about her he'd never seen her face-to-face she was trying to get two or three hundred dollars from him for a phone, do not pay the money for a phone consultation he lost the Attorney General's race when she went public and again with the Milkman and mistress then she sued then dang he lied in the depositions and then when he got caught with the cop the other people who could show that they've been together and there was a history of that had an affair for like six months he was all that and paid her a substantial amount of money to go away so this is the kind of person who when I told Vince I was writing about this in my book he's like the number one I can't talk about either of those cases because they were resolved and there is non-disclosures and I do the things you know that's not true because number one Virginia is dead she had died so she can't see you and she went public and so did the wise owls that the Milkman in the mistress and I wouldn't you know I'm not interested in your sordid you know personal life but it's relevant because I'm arguing that you committed crimes in the prosecution of the Manson family suborn perjury hit evidence you know manipulator the defense by planning an attorney so I if I'm going to you know try to make this case and everyone's not going to believe it because you're Invincible EOC you know this prominent prosecutor author will I have to show that there's a pattern in this Behavior not only that you are lying under oath in the depositions in these two cases before you settle but you also lied to the police in the in the Cardwell case and you lied to the papers and both if I have that in my book then people be more prone to believe that you do the same thing in and the tate-labianca but you would break rules to win your connections did he have a Ghostwriter for Helter Skelter. Collaborate call Vince's wife came to her house and knocked on her door and said please do this my husband's making me crazy we know that he's your husband. Man isn't the father of my my boy but just do it to make him stop and the milkman's wife said we're not we don't want anything to do with you people just leave us alone and go away if you cuz you don't understand my husband is mentally ill he goes he'll never stop that's why there's nothing I can do to get him to stop at the end of our 6 hours I don't know put in the book I might not have he said to me no kill things I have some psychiatric issues and she's been trying to get me to go to a doctor for ever so you know I'm not saying that this is a reason some of this stuff might have happened but I do you know I don't even know why he would tell me that but yeah so I think that he was able to be manipulated because of these vulnerabilities compromised daughter and a mistress for the next 30 Years I interview the mistress I didn't put it in the book you know I didn't think it was necessary I guess now I'm telling it but it actually got reported after he died cuz the Mistress of told a few other people I'd known about her for years and I knew he had a daughter who was you know at the time of Vince's death she was in her thirties I think are you the mistress I didn't put it in the book you know I didn't think it was necessary I guess now I'm telling it but it actually got reported after he died cuz the mistress it told a few other people I'd known about her for years and I knew he had a daughter who was you know at the time of Vince's death she was in her thirties I think</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> so these groups were trying to incite violence now we get to the motive of of of the official Narrative of the Manson Murders are the tate-labianca murders which is what the prosecutor vincible EOC presented at trial which was the famous Helter Skelter mode of Manson believed that there was going to be a race war and he wanted to incite this race war because he had convinced his followers that through messages he received from the Beatles White Album from there lyrics from Biblical Old Testament prophecies that he had been told that he was going to be the savior of the world and once a race war started he would hide his family in a bottomless pit in the desert and when the race war ended with the blacks winning the blacks would be frame for promoters they would the Manson family would emerge and repopulate the planet with their perfect top Offspring and dominates the blacks but whether or not it was the motive for the murders is I raised serious questions about the mansard would discuss it in that way that there was going to be a race war and that they would emerge and then their offspring yeah yeah except for the fact that I was questioned so the way Julio C was able to convicted Manson Manson wasn't at the Tate house when the murders happened he had in the official story dispatched Susan Atkins Patricia krenwinkel Leslie Kasabian and tex Watson to the house Palmer House of Terry Melcher they didn't know who live there but just to kill everybody and has mansinthe allegedly said leave something witchy he wanted it to look like blacks had killed these all he did was they were wealthy beautiful whites and he wanted to ignite the race war because of the Panthers got blame for these motors then the police will crack down and then they Revolt the revolution would happen they would be it would spread across the whole world and then when it was over and the blacks had prevailed they were too dumb Manson believed to be able to run the world that's when he will come out with his followers of their hole in the desert and take over the planet now Julio C said in interviews that I didn't have until after he and I stopped speaking which is when he started threatening me with lawsuits and other things in the in the 2006-7 I discovered two or three interviews he gave in the early seventies where he was asked if he believed that Manson really believe this craziness and Lucy Lucy said I don't think Charlie believes in it he got his followers to but he never believed in that he was too smart he was a con man what the interviewers didn't ask him in the follow-up was well if he didn't believe it why did he send his followers to kill these people the first night at the Tate house II night and was valassis the upper middle class the labiancas then you know what was the motive and that's one of my biggest regrets is that I slept and they were kind of obscure when was a pan house interview the other was original newspaper but that I didn't have them I thought I had done all the research I thought I read every interview he'd ever given but I didn't have it at hand to say all right then. I get that cuz I don't think Manson believe it either then what was the motive for the murders why were they sent there to kill and that's what the book Explorer so do you think bugliosi was operating with the knowledge that Manson was apart of these programs that's the big question yet he invited me to his house and Pasadena April of 99 we spent Lily 6 hours together he was so kind and generous time I thought I scored I had the prosecutor hadn't given interviews of he always gave interviews about this but he hadn't for a number of years agree to do it for whatever reason and during the course of that interview you know I arrived at his house went to Kitchen his wife gave me Italian cookies with coffee and lemonade then he and I went out to lunch in the valley somewhere he showed me some of the sites connected to the murders then we went back to the house and cocktail Sunset and towards the end of the six hours I did realize that even though he was talking Non-Stop and I'm recording everything he hadn't given me anything new or different I mean I just finished Helter Skelter I read it for the first time so I never been interested in the case till I got the assignment so I took what we call the Hail Mary pass in journalism which is you ask someone if there's anything they could tell you off the Record not for attribution that will help them to get something fresh cuz I was still searching for a go to the first month of reporting and then kind of thought a minute and then goes turn it off turn it off so I turned off the recorder and he did I could tell he was debating but then he told me something which I'm not sure if I don't think I reveal it to the last chapter is off the record with salacious pretty shocking in the larger picture and it doesn't change anything really but it showed me that he is a very count of something very important in the narrative and I took that away and I thought wow I'm going to delete it was off the Record in 2005 when I interviewed him for the second time and all things went to hell and he started threatening me and with lawsuits and writing letters to my publisher trying to get them to stop the book he wrote about what he told me and he claimed that I had dragged it out of him and embellished it and all this but once he put that in the letter the lawyers at the Publishers that was not on the record anymore because these documents will all be in a Civil Trial when he soon as you what you said he was about to do not off the Record by the police the first day after the murders they found it hidden up in a loft videotape videotaping home video taking was relatively new at that point not a lot of people had cameras but Roman Polanski did and in Helter Skelter Vince says in the book that the police took the tape viewed it and it was just Sharon and Roman making love and returned it to The Loft Roman was in London at the time of the murders he came back immediately and then about a week later he went up to the house and one of the first things he did was he when I pull off and he never even knew that they took it allegedly that that's a story found it and took it Vince told me originally off the Record that the tape wasn't of Roman and China making love it was Sharon being forced to have sex with two men against her wishes and he said Roman was the one who's making it cuz you could hear him in the in the background you know if you ready to pull you read those chapters when we did a lot of bad stuff to Sharon yeah he seem like a terrible person when you hear what he did what the reason why I can never come back to the country go well okay it makes sense it makes once I have that that's kind of the first rabbit hole I went down cuz I'm like well if this was different in the official narrative what else might they have changed so Vince and I were talking on the phone about every week for two months he was so accessible so I'll be interviewing people and one of the first things after that that I found was the perjuries by Terry Melcher on the stand I found I got access to two separate files and found that Melcher Doris Day Saint record producer youngboy wonder who lived in the house with his girlfriend candy Bergen on Cielo up until January 1st of 69 then moved the Malibu and Roman and Sharon moved into the house and February melchior was the part of the motor for why the house is picked and again this is getting into the weeds but it's hard to talk about any of this without the sex position Manson sent his followers up there to instill fear in Melcher by killing all the occupants of his former house who were strangers to them I don't believe that that's the official narrative but melchior testified at the Grand Jury and then at the trial that he had three fleeting encounters with Manson one of these boy drummer Dennis Wilson's to there I think and then one there and then to when he went to the Spahn Ranch in April and m69 to listen to them play music with the possible possibility of recording them and he didn't think they were talented enough and told the trolley that in so many words and then again this is the official narrative that's my man some kind of spy role in one crazy cuz he been rejected by Terry Melcher so he decided it was time for Helter Skelter the race war and again a lot of these things don't add up when you back why did he kill Terry Melcher at the house in Malibu cuz he knew where he had moved to widen just go to this other place and kill strangers maybe Terry wouldn't connect it all that bottom line was Terry on the stand and then all the official Accounts at this case of which there are many nights is helter skelter but lots of books his relationship with Manson ended in May of 69 he said he never saw him again when the murders happened at his former house it never occurred to him it had anything to do with him wasn't Manson I stopped believing that a month or two in and then I found these documents showing that meltra actually had gone to see Manson twice at the Spahn Ranch after the motors and then once all the way out at Death Valley where they had the Barker Ranch where they were hiding when they were finally captured in in the fall of 69 once I could document that that changed the whole I mean it didn't change that impacted the mode of a Mauser was app witness the camp is Charlie wasn't at the Tate house Manson Hut Arbolitos he had to come victim of conspiracy and other words ordering people to go up there and kill and he had to have a reason for that house at Terry provided it by saying yes I did go out there and try to record them and then eventually the question that came out but I never had anything to do with him again I had no idea I never saw him or heard from him motivation was Revenge she was using but it didn't make any sense because Melcher saw him after the murder several times I think you could get away with anything then because the antics of the family at the trial and everybody was so horrified by what was going on nobody was looking at this critically and questioning stuff cuz everyday you know Manson and the girls are getting thrown out of the courtroom for screaming for singing for dancing for mocking the proceedings so all this stayed under the radar but once I could prove that melt relied and then two or three more than I knew that I had to question the entire narrative so fully OC started monitoring my interviewing this is all laid out in the beginning of the book so by the fall of the first year of 99 I got a call from one of my sources Rudi Altobelli with another important witness he was the man who owned the house with murders happen he was traveling he was actually in Europe with Sharon who would come back about about three weeks before to have her baby and Rudy it told me from the very beginning he was very close to Terry Dennis Wilson in the third guy Greg Jacobson Craig Jacobson was another important witness who lied throughout the whole all of us that somebody in the trial just did a narrative needed Rudy had told me that that's called him what are you telling this O'Neill no one was supposed to know about that means promised me it would never come out so at that point I knew that I was onto something even even bigger and then I got a call from Vince and he left a message on the machine saying he wanted to talk to me what's important so I called him back and he said you know I'm hearing can't remember who told me another little game of his he would never be the guy said to me or one of my friends events that someone told her that you're questioning my tactics in my choices at the trial is that true you're not time with what's going on here I go I'm looking at stuff missing you know you knew where this was going I mean I know we haven't talked at that point we hadn't talked for about 6 weeks I think you have I want you to assure me that I'll be given the opportunity to answer any of these questions because what might appear irregular to you as a lay person can be easily explained by me as well of course not definitely swing back around to you before you left and I thought this was going to be out in August and we were in like October I think it'll yeah I got an extension it's a booking that you lied that it's not a magazine so I don't know I'm still getting paid by Premera cuz I was at that point and I had no idea it was going to be a book cuz we're still in the first six seven months so at that point we stopped talking Vince and I and it wasn't until 2005 when I got my book deal that I went back to him with these questions I thought hope naively that I would get him to break down and say yes it was all the CIA operation I was Opera stupid as really freaked out by how deep you got into this he's going to hurt me like I've never been hurt before and he's going to sue me $400 hundreds of millions of dollars is crazy or when you get to the end of the book you'll see the outcome of that day and what happened when he's begging me he's saying he'll give me a quote on the cover of my book if I don't publish this stuff and and then when I wouldn't agree to anything then the lawsuit sweat started happening so I naively I didn't think it was going to break down and say I was working for someone else I had no choice friends but instead he was evasive threatening screaming denying here to recorders I had two recorders he went off the Record every two minutes so we have to turn off all the recorders and then switch not turning his attention in Turner's back I don't know you didn't turn it off wait no that's mine is yours so woman and he's screaming and cursing at me going they were already on because we couldn't keep up with all the off-the-record she's then when I got home that night so I walked out of the house 6 hours exactly almost six hours just like the first time 6 years earlier he's grabbing me by the arm of this isn't quid pro quo this isn't quid pro quo but if you don't put this ridiculous nonsense in because you know a blur from Vince Polly always refer to himself in the third person 1020 times a day mean the man Z goes you'll see that in the book when I get home that night there's messages, call me and he called me I think it's a week we can have almost every day the next morning a few days later trying to he would believe me and then he said this is going to do to my family my kids and all that went on and on and on unless you have them I know I know and then he knew he said when we finally goes at the very very last phone call which is the week and a half later he goes so you really going to go ahead and do it this then I'm going to report what I have I go if you want at this point I thought I had sold the book so he knew I had a publisher I told him who it was and he asked for Hooters name there he said because I will be sending them a letter because I will work on this letter for hours it's going to be a complete rebuttal of everything you argued all of your arguments all your points it's going to ruin you they're going to cancel your deal cuz they're not stupid so he wrote the letter they got it and I think it was June or July after February of that that year 2005 and I got a call from my editor he said you got to talk to our attorneys I hate those we have a letter from fence I go I told you it was coming it's 34 pages single-spaced with 50 pages of attachments and I've never seen anything like this so he said talk talk to the attorney so they sent me over to the attorney and he said my first question. I never met the guy before he was my first question for you O'Neill is is he suffering from dementia I was a law student during the trial and he goes I follow the trial everyday in the paper I've read Helter Skelter he was brilliant because I can't believe the person that wrote this letter wrote that book so maybe you were dealing with somebody who is impaired I said he's mentally ill and have a lot of proof of that in the book he is not the match I go he's finishing his magnum opus a 20-year effort to write a book The rebutting the critics of the information about the Kennedy assassination I was got a book coming out at or and sure enough you know he wrote I think two or three more books after that I go he's just I caught him all of his arguments don't make sense he's contradicting himself that letter goes off in the directions that it sounds like it's written by a Madman I go to going to inhibit us because I don't know where we're opening the champagne 50 pages of attachment of the first letter then about 6 months later another letter I think there were four total I quote some of them in the book it was not and unfortunately he passed away in 2015 or 16 and I get a lot of criticism by Demi to get it from her when he died I know he was sick off and on for a couple years but I've been accused by my critics of not publishing the book until he died because of these threatened I wanted him to be alive I wanted him to be accountable and have to answer to all this the reason I didn't publish it when I was going to polish it was penguin my publisher canceled my deal in 2011 date motive do to get back to the house the main motive is to ignite Helter Skelter race for the sub motive was to instill fear in Terry Melcher because he had rejected Manson so you're saying well then if it wasn't those then what was it all right if you look at the cointelpro objectives which was to to diminish the to neutralize left-wing movement and make them look horrible evil bad and this is what drugs are going to do to your kids the kind of outcome that this these murders had was to make the hippies the boogeyman I mean the biggest Boogeyman in the United States history I don't know forever but at least until the 70s came Charlie Manson and when Manson was and his family were identified as suspects the first week of December 69 I mean it was like Earth shaking because all of a sudden nobody knew who had committed the murders that the case was open from tell first of December you have photos on the front page of every paper in the world of these hippie women you know nursing children living communally who are accused of these horrible brutal slang and the argument was that end with the reporters were reporting was they had gone crazy on LSD and free love and and and the hippie ethic and that was same thing Johnson Control power trying to do their trying to damage the youth Revolution the youth targeted that house though he saying what we have to do this is when they were mostly battling the panther, trying to neutralize the Panthers and La was go after the whites the elite White's the Hollywood white or supporting the Panthers or something called a white panther party that began in La 67 or 68 Jane Fonda Warren Beatty Cass Elliot those three were actually under surveillance by the FBI they were part of this group Donald Sutherland and they were basically a support Leonard Bernstein they supported the Panthers they raise money so in this one, which I think it was the winter of 68 it's got the date said that what we have to make the whites think is that when the revolution finally happens when the blacks rise up they'll be lined up with everybody else and slaughtered so if you look at that memo that was part of their operation which was to they did it by sending letters making you know the whites carrots or if you read the book that this could have been okay I'll Circle until Pro operation to turn you know the world the nation the culture against hippies the left-wing the Black Panthers and they picked that house because it was high-profile because Sharon Tate bought it actually they were like the social Center of Hollywood it wasn't just movie people who was the music people Terry Melcher and Candice Bergen live there for two years before that was a party house everybody went in and out of their kind of represented the elite of movies Music Hollywood you know white people so that would have been a very high-profile place to hit Target Joan Didion wrote in her book The White Album that the morning she learned about the murders and she knew most of the victim she goes it occurred because I knew that the 60s attended they were over I mean there was also Altamont and I mean not a whole lot else but that was like a cultural watershed moment that the morning she learned about the murders and she knew most of the victims who goes that occurred because I knew that the sixties attended they were over I mean that was also Altamonte and I mean not a whole lot else but that was like a cultural watershed moment</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> and in the middle of all this isn't do f****** this the lady who said that Biden did something to her now she's saying it was sexual assault yeah but if they're smart they're going to swap by now right now they were wrong before like that here's why they're right now and they're wrong before anybody could come at anybody with an allegation for anybody could come in any high-profile when you say believeallwomen you have to live by that you got to believe Amber Heard tip of his finger on his pictures of the finger and is the audio recordings of the doctor looking for the fingertip they're looking for the tip the can't find the tip like where's the f****** fingertip the room oh my God look at the blood and you can hear them talking and she's like violently sobbing in the background, so they decide to give her three times whatever antipsychotic medicine there aren't that she's on so she's on this this dose they decided jacket up to 3x whatever the doses but meanwhile this I've had him me to do Mustangs to leave all women that's all anybody can can approach something you know the Press with a unsubstantiated allegation but somebody's high-profile I mean I understand that women aren't just willy-nilly lying about something but the picture changes when there's somebody is a politically divisive high-profile figure where there is a huge incentive to knock that person off right Brett Cavanaugh weather is Joe Biden is a huge incentive to derail that person so I think in that instance because I do believe that like most women are not just making things up that being said when you introduce politics there's a whole nother level the whole nother letter for sure I mean man who sexually assaulted women also for sure women have lied about being sexually assaulted those two things are they they're not mutually exclusive they go hand-in-hand right people are liars the people lie about the past on April people also or delusional people are also psychotic and schizophrenic people that try to get out of jail rapist you can't believe all people right you also can't believe all men will you also can't believe all women that's right you been Casey Anthony maybe just as bad as Fulton to pressure right close to the finish line that's weird Lady Gaga thing today with him and Lady Gaga where he's talking about how no one should ever put their hand on a woman and I'm watching this with the cuz I guess Lady Gaga was sexually assaulted but who the f*** is ever going to watch that and say you know what I was going to put my hand on a woman but now I'm not going to go back to that thing looks like Hillary Hillary haircut at look at it, looks a little I was just coming out now I guess people throwing it around now but if you were thinking about hitting a woman and Joe Biden is what keeps you from doing it I guess maybe if you're a woman who's being abused it could perhaps encourage you to go to the authorities right they couldn't perhaps I mean right but I would imagine but by saying but him saying no man should ever put his hands on a woman thinks they should disagree Public Service Announcement all that kind of s*** like okay who you doing that for like who who's out there going out. Joe Biden and he's like don't rape me like the people that we have ruling us I have been exposed as like Creations Rana these people everything they say scripted you know all of them are are in the pocket of big business interests and like and and these people have been exposed so now we don't believe anything</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> do all of us in the political world Joe Rogan's political leanings are like the great mystery in Franklin over Biden all these people I just don't think it's a good idea to take some and put them in one of the most propositions the world has ever known that's what I'm saying is not an endorsement of trump is it is a me saying you shouldn't have a man who's clearly clearly in the throes of dementia I mean I'm not a doctor but when you can't form sentences in public and you forget what you're talkin about and you you're you wander off into these conversations if you're not smoking pot if you're not high do not pills like what's going on well there's cognitive decline he's an older man that has mental issues and you know not to be cruel to him he's he's suffering medically this is it is the real issue and the Democrats want to sweep that under the rug and Trump is already to animal parties already dismissing him I mean that there is a recent thing that Kyle kulinski posted a video on his Twitter talking about this is what happened when you don't discuss the elephant in the room and Trump saying used to do it and ask him a question or something to bind Rodeo I didn't write that he's like that's a democratic operative he didn't read it he probably doesn't even know what's going on right now and he's going to he's going to continue to do that and it's it's such a vulnerable point and I I don't know why the Democrats thought it would be a good idea to take someone who's clearly got a problem and this is the guy we've all seen it that's not normal it's not normal to get like when he's talking about the Creator and he literally loses what he saying he's like you know the thing like the Declaration of Independence and the idea that he's going to be able to get through this and be okay on the other side to run the country for for potentially 8 years is crazy here's a better one Epstein FC's killer nobody thinks that if you have various theories are various stories that people come out and talk about with that one yeah and I just actually yesterday listen to Eric Weinstein solo podcast Jeffrey Epstein I love you listen to caught it he he talks about his kind of conspiracy view of it I wish I was there I would have been faster because Eric is too smart he's almost like to smart is one of those guys you talk to him I call you poor bastard you're burdened your burden trying to make sense of the world around Apes you know and all the trauma of an idiot like we were talking about he still also the 13 the twenty-year-old kid so you seeing hit a few run-ins with authority which makes it which makes him suspicious of authority and I think the r life experience defines that so you can see I've seen in a lot of different ways depending on how you've experienced but if you were there quite a lot of people that have met Epstein basically she took a picture with him your reputation is Tainted he was good me know how many people I don't mean to make it sound positive or negative it is what it is is the devil's going to be Charming so the other thing is he genuinely showed curiosity towards scientific ideas even out there big scientific IT specialist but maybe just look at it from the perspective of is the big Theory the big Theory right is that he's some sort of a intelligence operative right so he's an intelligence operative his job to try to infiltrate the scientific communities and there must have been a directive if he really is an intelligence operative is not like they like hey interest Big Love of science just feel free to do that in the side know what what what the f*** was he doing if he's an intelligence operative what is it that the intelligence having sex with underage girls we can't be that you know this is one reason people believe conspiracy theories is because a lot of them were true with you with the Epstein case like you were one of the first people that mean as a literal you're a professional skeptic and you looked at the evidence you like well you know what this might be a conspiracy you know I might be a conspiracy it's probably a goddamn conspiracy there's been enough of them about that one because after I posted something about the other two cameras broke or whatever somebody wrote me from that prison saying all those cameras are always breaking inconsistent with hanging and much more consistent with someone strangling you include including the actual area where he was hanging from supposedly like it is consistent with someone strangling you from behind not consistent with you hanging by your own weight after Weinstein got his is Harvey Weinstein got his conviction I thought they better have a real suicide watch on this guy play more incriminating to him though you know I think what he's got is probably hey I had sex with all these starlets and turn them into big celebrities and is I bet he probably doesn't want that out especially at this stage of the game nothing I don't think I'm going to make him look good and I think the thing with Epstein is he knew way too much about too many powerful people there's just some so many connections it could be made with that guy and that you know what to do gay people are asking questions that people like Bill Gates don't want to answer prince Andrew or any of these people they like to get you know I don't want to talk about this yeah by Gage but prince Andrew of course find out if it's true Bill Gates flu in the Lolita Express cuz that's what I was reading today there people trying to ask Bill Gates but it's so hard to know what's true and what's not true today that's the thing is there's so much data and so I mean one of the things that's really sad about the loss of respect for mainstream journalism and mainstream media is what we count can't count on them and who's regulating the independence who's regulating these websites who's regulating his people that are just you know so called independent journalist they're just tweeting things and finding things putting things up on their website says it's so hard to tell who's telling the truth and who's not do you want to see people piss in America fuc with football f*** with LSU football or Georgia football college football see what happens you think things are bad now f*** with the college football you know this is a weird time to because right before the election you know election comes in November or imagine if it was going on right now and elections like next week your boy Bernie dropped out yep Rap by Nate Bean Trump know that's your bath that's the guy it shows you how crazy the system is that they wanted him but they wanted Vidant it to to be there guy that they don't they can't admit that he's in cognitive decline all the time I speak for a living I f***** up all the time phuckable time to but we're also talking Library hours and hours and hours at a time if I had a prepared thing that I was doing like I stand up I don't fuk up in a sharp as f*** if you haven't worn those conversations they're asking you if someone wants to ask me questions about things that I understand like MMA or like comedy like if you want to ask me questions about things that I think about it and talk about all the time if you're blocked on but yeah I can talk to you and really clearly about those things and make a lot of sense he can't dad about politics and he's been a politician forever and that's your s*** he's he's and you know he's a guy who's suffering is in Decline and they going to try to win them out and whoever his VP is weather is Kamala Harris or whatever, maybe whoever it is but that's who you're voting for because of the timing of this right now we're in the s*** right where the April s*** is the worst time of the corona lot of people are dying this a slight drop off in New York people dying less today than yesterday slight drop off yesterday from the day before so things are looking pretty good California I can be hopefully everything's up and running again economy starts coming back on track Trump makes a couple of great speeches about Biden is more indecline it's not going to get better nose those two face off Trump's going to light him up like a Comedy Central roasts already dismissing him he's there he's like he's asleep Biden saying like someone said Biden said that he didn't write that was Democratic operative he probably doesn't even know what it says destroy a three-year-old is true</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I was a conspiracy not or if I was a country that was conspiring to take over the world this is not a bad way to do it I don't think that's happening right now I want to be real clear but it's kind of the same result that we're experiencing right now we're the ones being forced to shut down with who-knows-what consequences but it's also the right thing to do so we're all like whoa you know it's another one of those things about being a person the right thing to do still feels crazy since I was like all right we're just going to sit around and I guess that's what you have to do you know it's kind of in one way encouraging is so many people are willing to stay home and people aren't rebelling like f*** you this is my country I'm going to work I'll take a chance everybody's going to get it anyway f*** you weigh less people doing that when you consider that the government is controlling 320 million people pretty crazy almost everyone's complying with staying home is only a few essential businesses and we're going to have to I think really have spacesuits to leave the house and work goddamn not going to probably be like this is metal plastic thing that wash off you're sort of saying like I I look into the future to see where we're headed and I don't see a really see much out there cuz I don't know where it is but it's not anything good cuz there's nothing there and I'll see like going to the movies again seems like that's probably close to out movies were already dying anyway they've already opened up the Billy like put those right into your house between bucks perfect way better yeah I don't know that it's just that those are all the fun things we used to do so I f*** it's also once everything's in place where they can treat people effectively and they have the adequate number of ventilators then are we going to go back to the way things were or we going to have new standards and place I don't know I don't know man that they look they did an unprecedented thing they locked down the entire country to save people's lives never happened before we're in New Territory and you know it's dangerous when a moron like me is making sense when I'm one of the people talking about something like this give us your take on how we got here because this is it's been very strange obviously the president completely miscalculated what was going to happen in the way he was explaining it to the news he was kind of saying that it was just a few cases and they'll be gone and now obviously New York City shut down the entire country is separated from each other everybody is isolating at home give us your take on how we got here will let you know that the truth is we knew this was coming or something like it we had a heads-up and and even a even a heads up before last year because this is now our third major coronavirus disaster of the 21st century we had what's called * severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 that started in China terrible epidemic in Toronto and actually took the the Rolling Stones to do a concert to bring the economy back to Toronto in 2003 and then it was mayor's coronavirus infection and 2012 and this is the third one so we actually do realize that coronavirus is we're going to become a new thing and we embarked on a big rotavirus vaccine program a decade ago and each time Parker so the point is this sung fortunately is becoming me normal for the globe is terrible coronavirus epidemics and we saw this one coming up and at the end of 2019 in China and I knew we're in for trouble because that's what coronavirus is do weather to was this the other two SARS and Mayors now we called this new Once ours too so the reserves one than mares and stars to so both stars 1 and mirrors made you so sick and that's such a high case fatality rate that anybody who got it was almost immediately hospitalized and basically out of the community that the difference with this one ironically is it is it's pretty lethal it's about five to ten times more lethal than regular hello seasonal flu but also there's a big group of people who don't get very sick at all and so you have this Serta Perfect mix where it's not the most lethal infection we've ever seen it's not the most transmissible infection we've ever see but it's high enough in both categories that are combined in this very toxic waste so what you have is you have a group of people who are getting very sick or in the Intensive Care Unit like older people those with diabetes and high tension even a group of younger people who are getting it very sick and then a larger group who only getting mildly sick who could still walk around the community and be out and about and stores and restaurants and infecting everybody and so this is what caused the problem it's a it's highly transmissible news on big group of people walking around spreading it and a smaller subset but a big sub said we're getting very sick and even dying in intensive care units what's playing on in New York City right now. What it whatever is stopping people from funding medical research I hope they open up the floodgates now I hope they realize you need more of these guys and then you a lot more money and they need to be way ahead of this s*** we have because this is one pandemic there are multiple different scenarios of how this happens again sure will there was another guy that died recently on a bus that they are identified as having a completely different bars in China but he got a virus that specifically hasn't jump from human-to-human it's only jump from rats to humans in the way it jumps from rats to humans is by ingesting animal feces or animal urine you know animal fluids somehow or Another live bat fluid in his body in and was dying on this bus and they pull the guy off and then you test positive for a totally different coronavirus it's killing him you think would happen I can imagine some guy gets Corona and he's got it f****** bad systems are shutting down this is it he's going to die and he wants to have sex again but he doesn't want to get anybody sick as dogs I think I cracked it and what if it's only his dogs but if everybody has to come to his ass in front of his dog we tried f****** a bunch of different dogs is there's no way to recreate this thing as we f*** Marty Marty but I thought Marty now we're all going to have to f*** Marty people everyday outside to Marty's house killing people to come too many times for Marta needs a break does it help if he blows you have put peanut butter on my deck see what happens no no no everybody's like the pounds or empty every dogs oh my God realize that freedom is itself an export and one of the great dangers is the China has been exporting the benefits of freedom from the United States into an authoritarian system so that they get the benefits of Both Worlds they get the benefits of our middle finger which I think is the secret of American innovation and they get the benefits of authoritarianism where they can do things that we can't because they can order people to do the unconscionable so my feeling is I'm on team civil liberties and team civil liberties have to be somewhat nationalistic more militaristic more command-and-control like who would you take orders from so in a lot of fields I take orders from you you're the big dog in the space you know and to the extent that you wanted to coordinate something I would use my channel I would subordinate to you and I would want sometimes people to subordinate to me if I have if I was taking a lead on something important when we have this fear of leadership because we're all so individualistic that we never want to take a note like whenever I'm training a new assistant or something one of my best practices is can I get your coffee you know it's very important to show that the ability to ask to serve somebody else in the ability to lead art I have to be a follower to be a leader in a liter to be a follower you can't you shouldn't be one of the other we need right now a more war we need more of a war footing we need for President we need we need War Senators we need people of this mentality because the nap is coming to an end and I do think Nancy Pelosi needs to resign and Bill de Blasio needs to resign I think that this Administration you know made some good moves and fumbled the ball and I believe that past administrations made some good moves and fumbled the ball and the imperative is to stop back propagating what you want to have what you want us to do like defeat prisoner's dilemma and come up with a lie that would cause us to act selfishly ration like if you tell me that a mask is actually more dangerous in my hands because it becomes germ-filled then the ideas I okay so I guess I won't use the mask yeah because you lied to me in the idea that that's what you're trying to do to get you to do what I want like if you tell me that the mask is actually more dangerous in my hands because it becomes germ-filled then the ideas I O Okay so I guess I won't use the mask yeah because you lied to me in the idea that that's what you're trying to do your fingers trying to say what would need to be true to get you to do what I want</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> who's originated the Surgeon General right now at Redfield I don't know I'm sure he's a competent physician I also think that there's a whole thing about pretending that masks don't work masks don't work in the general population please don't buy them or Healthcare people need them that is nonsense it's deadly nonsense deadly physician killing nonsense everyone I mean what we have is a situation in which we knew that the mask and personal protective equipment supplies are wildly off to say nothing of ventilators in ICU beds and now what do we do about it so we have rules like please don't bring masks to work because it's the patients or please don't wear homemade masks because they might actually be more germ-filled virus felt so you're back propagating what you wish to be true to get the action that you're looking for what we have is a prisoner's dilemma for everybody runs and buys up masks who like the people we need to be protected most of the heroes were actually dealing with covid patience and taking huge amounts of viral load so there's no question in my mind that those those are the people that is a society if you would level with us like there's a speech to give which would go like this my fellow Americans as Readiness are I am forced to Tender my resignation effective Friday this week I have failed to heed many of the warnings in our academic literature because our reserves are severely depleted imperative that we not suffer further loss of life and therefore I am forced to make an unusual request having failed you I'm asking everyone who stockpiled masks for personal use to think about doing something sacrificial for the good of us all our heroes are currently exposed to the coronavirus and taking huge amounts of viral load and I'm asking you to donate any unused masks that you have to this population as we are desperately trying to reach how much are stocks please continue to shelter-in-place and recognize that the benefit to you is minor in the benefit to us all as major and this will be following your heroic impulse to bring us back together as a nation this is it if that's where we are then it's time to revolt revolt I'll let her know what we need people to visit civil Civil Disobedience to put our Healthcare people I have not been off my property for weeks the reason I'm here in part is to do what little I can and it's very little to support the people who we who are literal heroes are life-and-death putting this out themselves In Harm's Way idea for Hospital administrators abusing our physicians and nurses makes me apoplectic with rage the fact these people are told that they can't talk to the press and they write to me in there their family and the children write to me my mother was asked to do this my Uncle Works in a prison he's not allowed to wear a mask is not allowed to bring a mask I send a message Baba blah blah blah for us to remember that we have the ability to turn over government this is we are so unprepared as a nation and we've been sold out for so long by our self-appointed leadership class who nobody wants that we either remember who we are and how this game is played at me this is like this is a pre-war footing and this can easily lead to war the transmission mechanism is you have everybody stay indoors because you're worried about deaths of accountability which is you know I don't think they're worried about the number of deaths I think they're worried about debts that the result from triage and that would result in career-ending action this is what you would say on the phone that you think that's really what's bothering them yes and then but if y'all have to stay home while they replenish our supplies then the economy goes into recession recession can become depression depressions the darn conflict in our armed conflict leads to war that would be a transmission mechanism from these stupid masks something that nobody can handle and my here's the thing we are coming up on Passover and we Jews have a tradition that I wish everybody had which is that we read one stupid story every goddamn year just a drill it into your head to make sure it's always fresh and this is when it's time to leave when it's time to change don't wait for the bread to rise this is what I say to every Jewish person like are you sitting around waiting for the bread to rise because they all know the story which is you eat the goddamn that's because the people who waited for the bread to rise are no longer with us their descendants are no longer with us and it is time to revolt this leadership class is unworkable to reason that you and I both came to the word Tulsa instantly. I don't think you took much deliberation is because Tulsi would know what to do when she's also the least encumbered she's at least burdened by everybody everybody in the system hates me yeah you know in the whole point where she would put heads on Pikes this is the moment for heads on Pikes and its importance of Vengeance thing the importances what is the cost to you killing people by failing to heed the academic literature if if a supply was was depleted and you didn't replenish it what is the cost to you there's lessons in how other countries have of you this and how they chose to act particular South Korea South Korea acted quicker smaller population than us but a much more impact the virus they shut things down very quickly yeah yeah and making sure that they visited anybody was known I mean they had a different system and it is people like you and me who loved our civil liberties I believe it in part Singapore's Draconian Society lives off of things that only we can do to our freedom so you have to realize that freedom is itself an export and one of the great dangers is the China has been exporting the benefits of freedom from the United States into an authoritarian system so that they get the benefits of Both Worlds they get the benefits of our middle finger which I think is the secret of American innovation and they get the benefits of authoritarianism where they can do things that we can't because they can order people to do the unconscionable so my feeling is I'm on team civil liberties and team civil liberties has to be somewhat nationalistic more militaristic more command-and-control like who would you take orders from so in a lot of field I take orders from you you're the big dog in the space you know and to the extent that you wanted to coordinate something I would use my channel I would subordinate to you and I would want sometimes people to subordinate to me if I have if I was taking a lead on something important we have this fear of leadership because we're all so individualistic that we never want to take an order like whenever I'm training a new assistant or something one of my best practices is can I get your coffee you know it's very important to show that the ability to ask to serve somebody else in the ability to lead art I have to be a follower to be a leader in a liter to be a follower you can't you shouldn't be one of the other I need right now a more war we need more of a war footing we need a war President we need we need War Senators we need people of this mentality because the nap is coming to an end and I do think Nancy Pelosi needs to resign and Bill de Blasio needs to resign I think that this Administration you know made some good moves and fumbled the ball and I believe that past administrations made some good moves and fumbled the ball and the imperative stop back propagating what you want with what you want us to do like defeat a prisoner's dilemma and come up with a lie that would cause us to act selfishly rash look like if you tell me that a mask is actually more dangerous in my hands because it becomes germ-filled then the ideas I go okay so I guess I won't use the mask because you lied to me to get you to do what I want what he saying so if I say for example let's imagine that I don't want to put seatbelts in cars okay and I say you know Joe a seat belt could trap you should your car go into the water off of a bridge you could infect die from the seatbelt because you become entangled it would not be able to save yourself with this map thing but that masks actually can contain are viruses and they can pull. Can kill you but you believe that that's what I'm trying to do I'm trying to say is a related rate problem let's talk about everybody gets sick and dies from contaminated masks everybody gets sick and dies from a false feeling of safety let's just go through a huge list of every bad thing or in terms of I don't breathe in either aerosolizer droplets whatever blah blah blah The Chew are real but you're focusing on like the seatbelt deaths of entanglement because you actually have a covert agenda and like and you're going to think I don't know exactly but if I had to speculate we're terrified of triage deaths deaths that occurred simply because we didn't have enough resources that was mandated to be stockpiled or talked about in the literature that's one thing that is what is liability which is all we were following the surgeon general's recommendation at the time now somebody suddenly found you know I like all the masks in the world I think that the Surgeon General would suddenly said the science would become conclusive because there would no longer be a worried about liability you just get those masks that meetball you'd get the mask to the people who need them and then you stopped transmission slow transitions transmissions by there's also a lot of just figuring it out as they go along there is figuring this out as it goes along as regards The Mask I believe that everybody knows that masks save lives on balance they know that the people who need the most have very weird rules there's this whole thing that the States versus the federal government there's this issue about price gouging and price mechanisms there all sorts of things stopping the mask problem from being sorted out one of which is the masks that are produced in China in the fact that we may have sent masks and personal protective equipment to China so there's a huge issue of accountability and responsibility and that we're back propagating our response how much we quarantine and how much we locked down what are we saying about about what the why the positions are being told not to wear masks when they're seeing patients A Deadly nonsense structural nonsense and it people like you and me don't call this out using like these crazy channel that we have then the narrative just stands until partially what we're doing is a parallel sentence making operation to the standard media which is Twitter said we will now be removing tweets if you contradict official authoritative Health sources so that's just what I did surgeon general's line sense-making operation to the standard media which is Twitter said we will not be removing tweets if you contradict official authoritative Health sources so that's just what I did surgeon general's lying cdc's line who is lying come at me</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I have not been off of my property more or less in two weeks so it's crazy to see another human being the dogs get close to each other go back like let's say the end of July everyone announces we got this thing lockdown we have a viable treatment it's no different than the flu and get you this chloroquine with the Z pack or whatever the current treatment is tongues were almost like just acquaintances I don't think that's a good idea still cold and cooties and all that but I think I think everybody's losing their s*** they definitely are I've been talking to a lot of friends that are on the extremely cautious I'd say that and you know they're not going anywhere and they're wearing gloves and masks when they step outside their house to go do some in the backyard and they put the gloves and mask down and they spray it with Lysol and come inside and it's not healthy and it is also healthy I mean the idea that we have not been tested in so long it's good to remember also that the stuff is live and real and it is always been live and real and you know if it was possible to live without the stuff that would be one thing but the 75-year nap that we've been in since 1945 is itself the greatest threat to all of us in our preparedness is just a wonderful indicator where you actually get to see this is the koala your experts this is the quality of your leadership this is what they look like when put under stress that's true right that is a good that's a good thing and I'm impressed with the medical community I'm impressed with the people that are recognizing that this is a huge problem not so impressed with the administration of all these hospitals that have them prepared and terms of like masks and ventilators and a lot of these other things not so impressed with politicians but also it just seems like everyone you said was in this nap State and hadn't really been tested and really globally no one has been tested since the pandemic of 1918 like this right 68 which I had I had the Hong Kong flu and 57 we're sort of the best parallels to this you got the Hong Kong flu and I had the Hong Kong flu and was sick as a dog I was like three two from 68 to 70 remember it oh yeah and I was in San Francisco my Grandma had to come up from LA to care for me it was it was bad there's like one of my earliest memories and 1657 I think are the best comprable to this before we go back to 1918 and almost nobody remembers these things because very weird many people that never heard of The Conch conch flu when I started talking vaguely remembered it until you just said it one of my 52-54 remember the Hong Kong flu but I do you know what I mean like I don't remember it personally know you as a health geek are up on these sorts of things that so you understand the ways in which you know for example you can never flew where the I guess the cytokine storm you know is you're either the threat from your immune system is like bigger than the virus itself or all of these various things that happened but I think that this let's call it the big nap the big nap is itself the greatest threat to us in this is this is bad but it is also a shot across our bow and it ain't this what was happening in my mind when I was on here talking with the twin nuclei problem of selling Adam we didn't stop history is not like we're past Atomic were like we figured that out we just we just hit the pause button for a little while we hit snooze and the fear is also that nefarious play will take this opportunity to a road civil civil rights to Road civil liberties and then China to gain power in the US market to gobble up a lot of stocks why everything is down and try to increase their stake in our economy and try to push you know his hands lovingly around her throat because our Elite have been moving into greater and greater States of China dependence right and so with the BDSM community refers to his breath play and I don't like it I run plays like he kind of like half choke somebody how do you know that not that huge hierarchy rules and my claim is is the China is they Supply so much of our stuff we moved all of our manufacturing base into these crazy supply chain and we are completely dependent on a strategic rival and inner China is very careful if you remember when they when they hosted the Olympics to have these amazingly impressive displays that are always friendly what they're really saying is we have our s*** together and you don't and our system was hackable it was open as long for example if you have a company that has Duty twitch shareholders that the directors of the company must do whatever whatever is in the best interest of the shareholders and everything else doesn't matter then you can have a situation where a director has to move things to China because that is in the best interests of the shareholders even if it's absolutely not in the best interest of the United States this is what Ralph Gomery who used to head this phone Foundation once said in an address I was at at the National Academy of Sciences he just said as a director I am incentivized to do exactly the wrong thing for the United States of America so I'm going to put one hat on and tell you as an American we must not move all of this over to China and then I'm going to put my directors hat on I'm going to vote to move everything over to China because I have no choice and so you know Essence the smart good people all 11 of them we're always fighting this thing about you cannot become to China dependent and it's during the big nap there was no way to make this argument convincing you couldn't say look we have a serious strategic Problem by your gate continuing moves to bring China in is the solution to every equation we can't balance and that that is really the problem is that there wasn't any ability to say we are way too dependent on a strategic rival you saw this at the beginning of the pandemic everyone was afraid of what I don't want to be. Is that a phobic I don't appear like Chicken Little until all of our friend the nutcases the marginal weirdos the supposed grifters and gadflies are the people who most got this one right and early and all the respectable people like Nancy Pelosi telling people please go to Chinatown to celebrate the Chinese New Year Bill de Blasio of New York City despite Coronavirus get out there let you know. Leave your lives don't don't let this thing hold you back these people need to resign Nancy Pelosi should resign is one thing to say we don't have enough information about this it's another thing to say take the information that's coming in disregarded and get back in there and keep fueling the economy this is exactly our leadership class there probably think about this in short-term you can Onyx be the long-term implications of us off shelter play nobody can compute the consequences of not one person in the world knows what happens when you run this experiment the made-in-america argument was always like sort of frivolous almost xenophobic like why do you want things made in America what do you care do you not do not like people from other countries do not want to buy things from other countries it was like this made of it made in America thing was like people to disregarded it in a lot of ways but when you realize that all of our medical supplies like Soma Tomar Electronics so much of all of the stuff that you need to kind of keep things exactly the way they are it's cheaper to make it over there because they will like what we saw at Foxconn but they put Nets around the building to keep people from jumping off and eat the weirdest things people trying to argue that the suicide rate at Foxconn was essentially the same as a suicide rate in the general population talking about that's where they work there's Nets around where they work is so many people where they work jump off the building to end their life because their life sucks that bad that they kill themselves at work so rare it is to kill yourself at work probably pretty f****** rare you know, that is where you have to put Nets around the building and look we're getting really tired of people going to the roof and jumping off cuz it's the easiest way to kill yourself they're going to get more creative yeah the problem is we are all hooked up to this or cheap product profits when we can't figure out how to innovate enough to actually create the juice in her own system and therefore we have to rationalize so we've gotten into this idea of every year we have to have a newer better piece of electronically if you had to go the rest your life with an iPhone 11 how much would you suffer not that much although I would say that many of us are not that excited about the next phone that would that that itself is an antiquated rabbit what I'm saying is like to why can't they make it so that you can just fix this I mean like who the f*** fixes their phone you don't fix your phone you bring it into going back to like the questionnaire I think you not depression-era thinking it's like why can't things be sustainable the plants obsolescence in the need to update so that you never a problem if you need growth to power your system then in a weird way it makes sense not to build the optimal phone because if you were to build the optimal phone and then people stop renewing everything your system stay in your system weirdly breaks down so it makes sense that the levels of the phone that you wouldn't want to do that but weirdly in aggregate if you can't start innovate if you can't figure out a restart innovation in a big way now you're stuck with either having to learn to live in steady-state which none of us Americans have no program for living study state we need growth that was the whole point of the embedded growth obligation idea that it's suffused throughout every institution every Pension Plan assumes growth right all right so now we have this problem where we don't have the growth and we need the growth and then in a weird way the planned obsolescence is like fake growth it means that we're going to re-buy our phone even as if they were now highly Innovative so there's like a weird way in which we become dependent on nonsense where we don't have the growth and we need the growth and then in a weird way the planned obsolescence is like fake growth it means that we're going to Bree by our phones even as if they were now highly Innovative so there's like a weird way in which we become dependent on nonsense</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> 2004 have there been plans implemented to clean up and also restore waterways and all the different absolutely absolutely in now there's like a whole they realize this is an issue until there's a there's precedent there's very much so and and that largely came from what we saw you know in those early years the 2004 first stop on down there on Dexter Canyon Creek and then what we had on Ciara's all my partner was shot 2005 about then we started also see the bear poison Cindy's grows like the carbofuran bottles and just to give a background this stuff is so deadly it was made as an insecticide rodenticide just to kill anything that you put on any type of Agricultural Product and it was made originally back and I think like the 50s for legitimate Agriculture and then when they found out how toxic it was NEPA Bandit from you sore even possessions felony to have in the country and use it anywhere without special licenses through legitimate channels Ali banat like 15 years ago cuz I was so nasty but because it does keep everything off the marijuana plants I mean nothing can even get near it without dying almost instantly they still get in third world countries they can get it in Mexico and it gets smuggled across the border with the groups that the drug trafficking groups because it's so effective regardless how poison it is and we were starting to see more and more of that stuff as we were starting to grab more of a specialty to do in this job more you know thoroughly and safely and get into the cleanup of this is one of them I brought this up with Dan Crenshaw the other day and I talked about you and because he's against federally making marijuana federally legal and I said one of the problems with it being illegal is des and I was explaining these grow-ops at for the rest of the country where marijuana is illegal by the vast majority it like what was the number that you said the percentage that was his grown in California that's illegally sold through the rest of the country 70% marijuana population or marijuana product that you're buying if you live in in place like South Dakota went wherever I don't even know it's legal in South Dakota where is the illegal they're buying it from here exactly and it's because one of the reasons because our state laws say that won't first while we're close to Mexico so the cartel members can come up really quickly drive and then the other problem is that our state laws when we made marijuana legal recreationally here weeks severely lower the penalty for any legal grow-op became a misdemeanor correct that was the that was the thing you know when we started the the Department's special team that the spec ops marijuana enforcement team that had more goes into part of my job is being the co-founder of that and a team leader was Outreach so I was speaking to legislative groups before we legalize under prop 64 than the tide or medicinal marijuana laws that that came about that same time and I was talking to conservation groups that you and I would be I'll be part of preservation animal rights groups high school kids new assemblies right watch out you know if you're using weed make sure you're not using this stuff cuz it's so nasty things like that and my whole point was if we're going to regulate guys we see a common let's just regulates Mark let's not lessen any penalties for the trespass grow that the cartels are doing our public lands of private lands and also the other game groups and there's there's other groups you know that to a smaller extent but unfortunately when we did regulate and all that was passed two years ago they did Watertown so public land cultivation went to like you said it a felony to a misdemeanor and if you're at juvenal cultivator on public-private land in one of these juvenile you know cartel members and there's a lot of young ones learning if it's an infraction and that took a lot of emphasis away from that part of the problem and left us out there basically alone with a couple other agencies to fight it for the average person that would sound before you knew about the cartel that would sound like a good idea at will hey if marijuana is legal was probably had a big deal exactly the other problem is these people that are buying this marijuana in the rest of country it's highly likely that they're going to have some of that pesticide on it right and how bad is that stuff is that stuff ever killed someone from smoking this it legal marijuana we don't know if it's killed anybody directly because by the time it gets distributed throughout the country does dissipate a little bit but it's still highly toxic to put it in perspective about three years ago we had two Federal officers back he's not even in California in a public land grow that had all that toxic on it so they have cartel grows out there they do they do they actually Crow we have them in about 20-25 or 27 other states to a much lesser extent and something we need to look at is California I mean we're one of only six Mediterranean climates in the whole globe so we are great weed growing stages like our wine industry man we got great great weather for it so we can grow outdoor indoors I mean February almost December right and that's why it's growing here and that's why the black market Dothan you know the private land communities in the cartels are everywhere across the country with this stuff but they'll go wherever they can until you know diversify the network so we do have it in other states to a much lesser extent and it's something we need to remember is even though about half the country has these grows in mm2 to a lesser extent than California the same groups are under the same Enterprise they're doing human trafficking doing gun-running you know to fuel the fight down to Mexico methamphetamine production and now the new synthetic fentanyl that's just killing thousands especially on the East Coast are coming from these group so it's all one enterprising of course we focus on the Cannabis issue because that's what the factor while Lancer waterways it's right at the Hub so yeah it is it's it's Nationwide it's not a California problem and we may be really really careful even though we're talking about a team in California game wardens we're trying to tell when they the Cannabis issue because that's what the factor while answering waterways it's right at the Hub so yeah it is 6/8 Nationwide it's not a California problem and we may be really really careful even though we're talking about a team in California game wardens we're trying to tell a nationwide story because the nation needs to know</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> first time I went to Japan with house paint until we go home and literally take one set of clothes out of a bag thrown in another bag and leave so we got to Japan and on this particular trip I brought my girlfriend at that time and I think Danny didn't leave his own homie or whatever but I'll be brought a bunch of guests and it really gets through customs and as I'm getting through customs the guy reaches into his one jacket I have any closes hand out and there's this I'm not going to but he's like what is that and I was like what can you speak English cuz he said it in Japanese so I said okay okay what is that was like my brain just was like well f*** man just stand looks like weed so it looks like weed you know I just f****** owned it that's just a little right f****** taping the f****** finger like I have like my my lady everything at the time everybody got the strip search they never strip-searched me they searched everything I had all my bags everything right they tested one nug of weed whatever I end up after several hours the record label paid off whatever their to pay off we got into the country and we're able to do our tour and the point in the story there was a f****** hate my guts the whole f****** Bunch when we get to the hotel I'm unpacking my back trying to figure out how the whole f****** thing happened and looking at the jacket and I reach into the pocket that was as nothing in there I think that's crazy I reach into the other pocket of the jacket I pull out a f****** ounce of f****** weed they never looked in the other pocket of the jacket but at the last tour like had enough left over just throw it in the pocket not thinking about it on one side for a long time but I got it I called the whole I called everybody that smoked in the crew down to the room after that and I was like your check it out man I really didn't mean this to happen but I probably had more good ass f****** weed in Japan than anybody at the time stop and think of that moment that moment if they didn't go in that one pocket and it went the other pocket first and they found that giant bag of weed we wouldn't be having this conversation we probably wouldn't know I don't think so that's a lot of weed who knows though Mouse paint this was like when the only story like it was like Paul McCartney is banned for life because he got caught with some weed that's that was like that when I don't know if it still exists but there was a point where he was banned for life cuz he got caught with weed over there working yeah that's a problem what's the number one problems number one problem with laws against things like we'd like as long as you can buy some Wiz Kids part of the number one problem a lot of it too is why these prisons are private eyes and they don't want to let a lot of these guys go home and get money for the amount of f****** people in their prisons this whole leg urban legend that I mean it's very believable about this letter that went around like a bunch of people in the in the in the hip hop music industry got not don't know maybe it was within the last decade where they describe like this guy claimed to be a member of the Elite Class of like Executives of the music business in there in the mid-90s and whatnot and there was a time when the private prison industry kind came and got involved in our lungs fast and then kind of help direct like things like rap music and then you remember these to be like public I don't know if you have big are you a fan of music you were at the time of Clans and Public Enemy lose all these proactive like you know counters to like the party drug dealer guys or whatever you're there was another side to it that we existed and was successful and flourished you know amongst it you know and that disappeared that begin like they're this letter that went around was I kind of claiming this guy was part of this thing and he left a meeting when they just got through the whole conspiracy thing I could go but it's like totally believable guys with director music and a f****** media in a certain direction to encourage f****** basically a cycle of f****** prison</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> article in the Atlantic about tracking you with cell phones and tracking you in comparison to trusted people that tested negative like that that that could be the way that we can release people from quarantine and this is because if you have to have a health app on their phone that's really do have to keep the app up-to-date there's one on every iPhone already yeah but I think this is a different kind of it's not you know it's a different kind of thing that like you have to have like you have to be certified that you tested clean for covid-19 it's on your phone Isabel certificate just accepted that people can be sick and we prefer Freedom over a hundred percent safety we've always accepted but my point is we've always accepted that and if we decide to keep going further down that rabbit-hole where we make someone carry device we can track their location you have to have a travel weird man up to what have you been partying all night and go to the airport then like I see you have cancer like no no I just did Coke slippery road if you tell people they have to have a phone everywhere they go right now you don't you can have a driver's license and or a passport and you can get on a plane and you're fine you don't have to have a phone you don't have to have a phone right now and I'm not saying you shouldn't have a phone but I'm saying if someone's going to tell you that you have to have a phone everywhere you go things are going to get slippery but what it was going to be able to track you 100% what if it's just like that's what you scanned and make sure you're healthy but that's the problem is this, but think about all Google has done and is not a knock on Google but all Google has done with basically just the information that they give two companies of what your activities are right this is the reason why when you're talking about things needs Google add pop-up why why is that why when you look up something you find those ads and everything was trying to tell you things figure out the modern what you're looking at you try to figure out what makes you tick why would they do that with this to why wouldn't you do that with this to why wouldn't I give if you could track people you could try out who's going to pay for that software and all that stuff would you rather and while they're doing their light you know everything they do what's this app on them but they can't leave behind the checks their health a group that has more power over an individual rather than another individual is not like the thing about having a massive group that can tell one person that they can or can't do something is it can be abused if everyone's even it can never abuse if we all follow the same rules and same laws then okay we all agree that you we all have the same amount of control and power over each other's lives but as soon as you have more control than the person who you're monitoring then things can get weird it's just natural people are weird they they control people they like controlling people they like abusing power a lot of people that have power abused power so if you give the power of constant surveillance and exchange for the freedom to be able to go everywhere you want in the relieving of quarantine we just want to know your Healthy no big deal like okay well let you out more likely what's more likely is a crazy thing happens and people automatically take advantage when they find an opportunity especially the more SoCal tickets at f****** conspiracy I take advantage of things that happen that's more likely what's more likely is a crazy thing happens and people automatically take advantage when they find an opportunity especially the more predatory amongst us</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I want you say it stand up in podcasting really yeah well podcast things right now its emerging as a different Beast see before people joke about it they will we doing like Howard Stern's to make fun of it I wanted you out your window what are you doing and you know what he was coming from you got to think he's a Pioneer and radio and traditional radio and he made his bones radio and he carved his path and radio then I'll send this thing comes along with anybody can do it the threat the threat but it's also see in a way I understand his perspective because in his day when he made it he had to compete against all these other Killers Arts you got all these other morning guys all over the country and then when he goes it's indicate so he'll invade Chicago he's invading Los Angeles trying to take over taking over but there was only a few slots right so you couldn't couldn't listen to his show later listen to it then so everyone's competing during these slots so you have the slot that is 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. that's drive time baby even now he doesn't know podcast and like I remember I used to listen to Howard for a long time and it probably like maybe a year ago they brought up something cuz you s*** on podcasting is to podcasters even make money and one of the guys got on there and I forget his Cruz name I think Joe Rogan if you like Snot long time listener first-time caller well doesn't matter what bum me out and again I'm a huge Howard Stern fan I think you and I think maybe I forget to send it to me by sense to you when Howard Stern it released that to his employees has like a a yearly like meeting with his employees someone recorded it damn it makes you feel so sick f*** did you realize how Hollywood Deuce by the idea of what first of all you need friends you need really good friends that are like you that are in your world I think one of them's is separates us all of us as comics from rest of Hollywood is like goddamn were glued to each other yes we're gluten we should on each other we laugh it would complement each other we love each other and call each other with each other different thing and no one that but also it's not a doggy dog know I know everybody is running out of that room telling everybody that murdered it and when is he Bill Burr Go on stage the main room and crush it you're coming out and saying it and I'm coming out and saying it and count saying it we're all excited like God damn that was awesome at holy s*** about telling people you see a love for the art and a love for each other did the camaraderie like the the wanting people to be good you realize like he doesn't have to just be about you and they didn't I don't think they I think that's what you were talking about competition earlier talking about Jordan and Tyson in the Balkans yes I think one guy like commit suicide news I guess I felt bad for that you know you don't like that that time that's what I had to do well that's what he did right whether he had to do it or not that's what he did what you know doing it it did work and you felt like you had to do and look he's also we have to be everything you have to look into you got to look at it with perspective and in my head would Howard Stern's always going to represent is that guy who paved the way like without him you got to realize there was nothing like Howard Stern before Howard Stern do it didn't exist you had on IMS was kind of risque and then Here Comes this really tall long-haired rock and roll type do doesn't give a f*** and you just want to have pornstars on my girls are riding vibrators and people farting songs in the microphones is madness and he's getting sued by the government man so that the government that their come huge judgements against the company that owns if he keeps going and he keeps Goin podcast all are you know Patrice used to say like Patrice you say about other Comics that like David tell Dave Attell got a lot of babies and what a man is that there's a lot of other Comics that would imitate David tell out of the fact that they were fans and they were insecure and if they're not plagiarist they just weren't good yet when I was young man I sounded I used to sound exactly like Richard jeni really heard myself on stage when I've been doing an open I caught myself doing like a bad Richard jeni impression with my material when I was like 21 or something 222 like, terrible it was such a Richard jeni fan at the time that is like mimicking him onstage purpose myself and a lot of mannerisms like Brian or delete anybody was he created this radio cab he created this chaos we had these these people this wack Packers were out of their f****** mind and he would interview them and and and talk to all these nuts f****** people that was the first one then remember yet but if he wasn't like oh how's your movie but we f****** and then he made it possible people to talk the way we talk and then Opie and Anthony were the next important phase because when Opie and Anthony where where hang where is Howard is The Man Behind the switchboard and Howard is in control of isn't is it is Universe with Opie and Anthony people just show up like I'd be on the air and it would be like four or five other Comics there and we would we would love it and Jim Norton download all the time whatever he's a very interesting. I loved his love of transexuals and he's honest and raw where were the first loose hang you know so I can get it would kind of be orchestrating a little bit we're like keeping everybody making sure you know keep an eye on everything making sure it didn't get out of hand and then Anthony is this very he's a guy who grew up doing construction and that's how I literally how it got in the radio but is also very intelligent very inquisitive since he's got like a regular guy sensibility but he's also very f****** smart and then he would have all these comics and then Norton was great, can South would be there in maybe Colin Quinn and Bill Burr and me and shaffir and all this madness man was nothing like that really know made podcast become what they are because like those guys Comics just hang out and talk no one ever like Comics just hang out and run the show before opening Anthony so the big steps to podcast and where Howard Stern is most important and then after how it's turned these are Howard Stern's babies Howard Stern's babies are like Opie and Anthony were Howard Stern's babies but they became their own thing just like a comic would imitate David Tao when he's a young guy up and then as he gets older he finds his own speed in this a lot of comics right now that are like top-level guys that I bet if you watch them 10-15 years ago they would sound a lot like someone else and then Opie and Anthony open up the door to podcast and cuz they made comics where they could just hang and then everyone's got their own style like Ron funches has his own style Erik Griffin has his own style you and Brian have your own style Theo's got his completely stopped all of us have these different thinks the girls got his style Christina pazsitzky have their Style Spartanburg yes the world is more Bountiful than it was back then it's not like Burt and Burr or competing against Bert was one run by one production company but Burton Barr will run by a different they're both going to be at noon and you have to listen to one of the other and Burton and it's f****** argument you now they're going to take us out of noon and that's that's that was what they had to do with it was a totally different Dynamic now it's a totally it's like we were trapped in these tunnels fighting for air and pop and we got to the top of the all the air you want is free are free are you can just put up a podcast video put up put up a makeup video makeup sketch fighting for Erin pop we got to the top of the tunnel in this all the are you want it's free are you can just put up a podcast video put up put up a make a video make a sketch and then it might get seen by a million people</div>

Imagine that having all these fights that you have to make and having all this pressure on you and you're also like a famous guy like Dana is only two president Family Dollars in the you get used to that you can use the help you do you do compensated well for it a man who doesn't give a f*** he's nuts did everyone Logan just f****** $5 as long as any other disease where we understood it better I would be way more confident you understand numbers though we do but we don't understand Michael Yo okay Michael you almost died almost. But he did it but he was in the hospital for a week but he's fine okay okay people who are less robust than Michael Yo to die so we got to figure out like what the f*** this virus is how is it get treated what's the most effective way and then then then it makes sense that we're a little bit more loose with our regulations 1% Michael Yo he's in this shape compared to the UFC fighter he's f****** Adele you know I'm saying like he's not in shape compared to Tony Ferguson works out alot you really does again computer Tony Ferguson that's fine anything you can do like that in the forest Island that's what I've been cool about this UFC thing if it really did go to f*** Island not anymore remote situation if it's a small island if you could control the whole island test everybody 100 how much money is the UFC and be spending on these private job how much money are they going to be making with the reality show about moving the UFC to the island cuz I'm watching that s*** f*** Tiger King I watching Dana White's with his crazy or screaming and running around trying to figure out a way to product Island international waters and that's what I do like bro that's one episode like this I'm hoping I'm hoping they obviously I'm hoping the current treatment is the one that works but two if that's not the one that works maybe they find something just as good I think we got a lot accomplished people that don't think it's a good idea but I'm not interested in putting myself at risk but my real concern was how do I know if I contracted it and then I bring it back how am I going to know and then I'll be honest to myself like I really wouldn't know so the only way I would be able to do it is to do it and then be in quarantine until I get tested it worth it packed it and then I'll bring it back how am I going to know and then I'll be honest to myself like I really wouldn't know so the only way I would be able to do it is to do it and then be in quarantine until I get tested that ain't worth it</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> that's all very promising you know it's it's really interesting to because it would become such a hot political topic you know there's so many people that are angry at Trump but they were angry at Trump back when he was closing the travel from China which turned out to be a great idea and you know Donald Trump Jr tweeted today a compilation of CNN and all these other different networks giving out bad information way back in January information saying this is going to be fine don't worry Dana it's not as deadly as the flu each worry about the flu you know don't change your plans don't do anything so a lot of people got this wrong and but so many people are trying to make this a political point right now and it's really it's so so useless it's it that you know about pointing fingers and everything at this point in time they need to concentrate on getting mask equipment keeping people healthy if they can and then Edge people on how to keep your immune system strong and lets you know it's try to let's try to get people to understand the consequences of not taking care of your body it has to be the worst job in the world president no matter what you do everyone's going to have two people going to hate you advantage of the of the pandemic to increase their power and civil liberties you know in hungry and and and turkey and Israel China of course Putin in Russia gets lumped in there like in Yahoo so you're something like this I mean you just clamp down on all travel until he would have been totally accused of being an autocrat he's you know he wants to be a dictator look what he's doing okay so he doesn't do that and then he's accused of not doing enough when it looks like we should have done more and then he said well I'm not going to tell all the governor's what to do and then I'm going to honor states rights for now and of course he gets hammered for that it's like you know but that's actually that's not what an autocrat would do in Minecraft would say yeah I'm telling everybody what to do in a drop all the polarisation politically rally around the present even if you hate him and Senators voted for the Warren at univ for the invasion of Afghanistan and including Iraq including Hillary right so maybe we ought to do that I know people just can't stand Trump and then he's at the idea like saying something nice or supportive or not being critical seems hard to do but maybe this is way worse than 9/11 2001 it seems like you just keeps ramping up and Trump is such a naturally polarizing figure that it's gotten another the left vs right has gotten so extreme right now it's almost impossible for rational discourse and this is one of the reasons why it's a good time now to talk about your book giving the devil his due to graph of the people that self-identify as Centrist vs. now which more polarized she had this two-hump camel here and that's from 2019 94 2004 and then close to today when did is that a trump shift that little hoe no no no no about 2,000 it will really under Obama by 2008 the polarisation got worse and worst far-left far-right young strong Republican strong the Democrat whatever and said that that middle ground has been is been drinking the centuries have been drinking in the polls have been increasing some more more people are polarized conservative talk radio and television or media but but in general I think we've just been more polarized in the sense of not just saying while I disagree with you I think you're wrong but that you're evil your more polarized in the sense of not just saying while I disagree with you I think you're wrong but that you're evil you're you're you're immoral you know this is the worst thing that's ever happened to us and so on this kind of ramping up of the cat catastrophism do you know is not healthy</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> identified though just a moment ago was that if people identify with their beliefs that is the specific say political platforms like an immigration abortion civil rights whatever secondary to the deeper core moral values that people hold I defined myself as a liberal and if I mess up as a Conservative Republican whatever and this but you don't need abortion thing I think you're wrong and here's what the impulses well but if I give if I gave up on that one then I'm going to lose all these other ones and then I have given up my identity rights out like when I get to debate creationist intelligent design theaters and so on you know I could tell that if I give people a choice like you have to choose between Jesus and Darwin for your life or not picking Darwin okay because it is sort of belief in their dogmas about Jesus that is their core beans who cares about Darwin and you know whoever the scientist was but if I say keep these as keep your whole religion I don't care what you believe what the science is really good on this and here's why you should follow the facts and you don't have to give up anything for it so I thought okay I'll listen Conservative then climate change is just a proxy for something else like I believe in free markets and free enterprise and I'm pro-business and those guys over there you know they want to attack that now unfortunately allegory success with his film and books and so forth then affiliated climate-science with a left-wing liberal cause there for conservatives have to go against it even though he knows how that much about climate science has become something else that you identify yourself is so we have to take that out of the formula like you keep your worldview that you define yourself as don't give up that but just follow the facts on these specific issues if you're right Wing you used most absolutely certain my skepticism about climate change right so when somebody publicly signals where they stand on say climate change what they're really saying is luck I'm I am publicly declaring my commitment to my team bet that's right in and saw a lot of cognitive science studies of reasoning shows that we we generally don't reason toward finding the truth but defending positions that are part of our team ideology or so Collective whole and in this case we've been talking about left and right but you know there's there's a religious idea or economic ideologies and so on that are part of that is that that's fine Defender team but you know what I try to do in the book has dissed entangle the specific issues let's just take them one by one like why can't I be personally against abortion I don't want to do that but I and I recognized say Ben Shapiro's Arguments for the rights of the fetus but I also think we have conflicting moral values are the rights of a woman and and the history of the way women have been treated and Men of always tried to Lord it order over women's reproductive choices historical this is always lead to bad things like infanticide and and back alley abortions and so on are on one side or the other I recognize and acknowledge your argument a really good band or whoever is a pro-lifer but I still hold this position I think there's a lot of progress that can be made socially to kind of reduce the tension when you say I acknowledge your position I understand it and Steel Man in the argument and then the person on the other side feels like I think that's a that is the best topic when it comes to that because it's when you get to a particular we get to a late-term abortions boy that's a very hard thing to defend morally and ethically and it's also one of things about the abortion topic is that it's so uniquely human in that it's such a messy topic it's not does not like here's a clear one don't murder people right don't guess it'll have to be yeah that's clean that's that's that's a clean subject abortion is not that clean like when is it okay is it okay when the fetus is not a fetus when it's just a bundle of cells most people like you when when do we decide will that such a messy subject and it's such a human subject and I like you I am on the side of pro-choice and I think that it is the woman's choice to decide whether or not she wants to keep the baby but I also recognize at a certain point in time that choice becomes very different the choice becomes very different when is a 6 month old fetus like what is what are we saying there if you if you are just I am pro-choice. Okay are you pro-choice up until the day of birth like when do you back it off when do you back it off and it it is a subject that people do not want to breach they don't want to touch and particular particular people on the left when it comes to deciding when it's okay when it's not okay because they feel like this is angling towards and elimination of a woman's right to choose and it angles towards this is very difficult conversation where are you you recognize that there is a difference between someone who's 7 months pregnant and someone who's 7 days pregnant there's a very very big difference and if we can't acknowledge that then we are being tribal we're being ideologic where's are sticking to our position because we feel like if we concede that this is a complex issue then we open up the door to possibly losing a woman's right to choose and losing these Reproductive Rights yeah I think part of the problem is that we tend to dichotomize most moral issues is right or wrong good or evil and in the problem is it the law has to draw the line somewhere we have to have a law and to get along teenage is this instead of that or the driving age is this the point of which you can have abortion is right here but most most of life is much more on a spectrum a Continuum so here I make the distinction in the book between binary thinking and continuous thinking most moral issues are on a continuum everybody know know where do you draw the line and another Messi human subject yep yep but if you think of it's like well it's a Continuum instead of a binary choice and you know whatever answer it's not just right or wrong good or evil that there's different places to set the the dial so something and hear the comparative method of looking at what different countries do is experiment thinking of those experiments like Japan has a very tight sweat it way down here they let almost nobody in Australia is a little looser but but the tighter than us and so on it kind of look at the consequences of letting just many people in or that many people and see what it does with all countries are different summer more diverse summer more homogeneous you have to account for that and I do not instead of binary thinking continuous thinking abortion you just articulated a perfectly I mean 7 days I'll come on you know it's just a bundle of cells Creed's thoughts on the Nugget place but we have to have a line somewhere so the lies to do that but that been forces us into that binary thinking which is not helpful between these two sides and I think that's so much of what people subscribe to when they do choose an ideology once they choose an ideology they they have this conglomeration of ID did they adopt and they adopt in order to be accepted by the tribe and its this is also a very unique aspect of human communication and civilization that we we have to adhere to the principles in the ideologies of that tribe so you just take on all these thoughts and it's one of the real problems with only having two choices in this country when it comes to politics and it comes to just styles of life you know and there's so many people that take great Relish in switching teams 2 is like I was a liberal my whole life then one day I woke up and realize I was being a moron and now and now I'm a pro-second Amendment Pro Trump Maga make America great keep America great it's interesting cuz those are sometimes the most the most passionate supporters of the new side whether they are there are newly liberal or newly conservative or you know some of the people that are the most interesting to talk to her people that used to be vegan carnivore with almost every style of living you can find a country style the people find appealing noticed people that used to be atheist to become Muslims and they they they they wear you know the hijab and they fully adhered to the Koran really really interesting because I've spent a lot of time watching religious Scholars online talk and watching them preach and watching it since something and as a person who is very agnostic when I watch that it's appealing to me there's a certain aspect of the confidence that they have when they're talking about what God wants or what you know what Allah has in store for you when you die or what you should do because it's written in this particular religious text the confidence that they have describe these things is very alluring even to me it's not like I'm going to join but I'm sitting there in front of my computer and I'm recognizing oh I see the appeal here but I see it I see how this works on people and I find it incredibly fascinating and I think it has two it has to have some sort of an evolutionary reason there's some sort of reason beside some sort of an evolutionary benefit that adhering and being accepting of the morals and the ethics in the ideology of the tribe is that that's how you stay alive that's how you find other like-minded people to stick with you</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> mr. Sherman how are you sir I'm fine thank you I'm still breathing good to see you again we were saying before we get started at the last time we saw each other was we went to dinner about six weeks ago and you're thinking that that might be the end of that kind of stuff that was my last time I've been in a restaurant actually and we made quit shaking hands and hugging to the extent that we used to although I don't think we'll ever ever go all the way to the say the Japanese model of social distancing but modifications like that the change of remote say meetings and education I mean I'm in the studio here in Santa Barbara where I've been recording lectures for my Chapman University class cups is in 101 and I just upload them and share them with the students and and then they watch him and then I said Wednesday take the quiz they send them back now that's not a complete replacement of a brick-and-mortar building with a small class seminar discussion say but but does not adequately replace a lot of traditional education that you don't really need to be in a classroom for do you think this is preparing us for the ultimate where we embrace the symbiotic relationship that we have with computers and become one with the machine and it seems like electronic community happening slowly already and this is kind of a jump starting it I mean already tech companies like Zoomer having to going to ramp up their game because you know the systems are crashing could pretty much everybody's doing Zoom meetings now theaters anymore and I love watching a movie on a big screen but you know that the screens we have at home now big television screens super high-def you know why not just watch movies at all so I don't think we're going to have much of a choice I was reading an article this morning but AMC Theaters might they might have to go under because of the really not good these companies are accustomed to having a certain amount of money coming in every month and I never no one anticipated anything like this or all businesses going to shut down gyms I mean how many gyms are going to go under how many yoga studios mini I mean it's a strange and trying time for people who have small businesses for sure that one of my cycling buddies owns the La Canada theater complex and of course rents out the the space two different retailers including the the theater the theater managers and he was telling me that they normally pay $93,000 a month in rent 7 and 1/2 million dollars a year or something so it's it all balances out but they just told him we're not going to make our rent this month so he has to go to his mortgage company or the bank that we gets pays off his mortgage and so I can't pay you this month because these guys can't pay me in case I multiply that by you know 10 million yeah well of course the government can't just print money and definitely then we're going to get huge inflation and then in that could be catastrophic compared to what we're doing to save people's lives dollar amount you can put on a human life there for total social isolation no matter what does the economy is what we're going to do now well it but at some point you know that you know there's a economic calculation like how many people are going to die saying the next year if we never open the economy we will but what point do you do that supply chain toilet paper stand and the idea of putting a dollar figure on a human life is repulsive to most of us I think intuitive laid in this context but in fact we do it all the time you know in terms of like an automobile company has to pay off the family of somebody who died in their car well there are people who do those calculations like what's the value of a human life and about 10 million dollars the family's got paid off I think it's $250,000 a person X the 3,000 something and you know it sounds so cold like who does those calculations well statisticians do that sort of thing and and attorneys and accountants work on that and judges and juries have to face it and you know that's kind of a normal part of other aspects of life that we're not used to thinking about most of us don't think about it but that's the kind of calculation going to have to do for what we're in now singing and attorneys and accountants work on that and judges and juries have to face it and you know that's kind of a normal part of other aspects of life that we're not used to thinking about most of us don't think about it but you know it's on point that's the kind of calculation going to have to do for what we're in now</div>

Cultural appropriation Tuesday is Taco Tuesday yeah that's cultural appropriation you know that the Mexican Community is being appropriated by these whites eating tacos like we're in Southern California where is there no tacos I mean this is it's like you know what today is and then he shows his talk Taco Tuesday and I was okay with you is he allowed to do it I mean the whole thing is preposterous it's delicious food you know it's not like we're saying white people created it or anything like that is so ridiculous in so many ways but one of the most ridiculous ways it is is that it prevents people from enjoying some amazing aspects of the diverse cultures that we all coexist with especially here in America this is such a illegitimate Melting Pot I think it's amazing that you can go to all these different places and that you know there's a guy I'm trying to remember his name Rick Bayless I believe his name is and he's a famous Mexican chef but he's not Mexican but he cooks Mexican food and he loves Mexican Cuisine he takes all these trips to Mexico to learn with the Mexican Masters and he has a famous restaurant in Chicago where he has a full authentic Mexican menu and people are furious at him because he already is this white guy selling Mexican food like what do you expect him to do like you have to be born a certain patch of dirt to enjoy a style of food and don't you think that he is actually boosting the signal and letting people know that there's some amazing things that come out of Mexico this is an homage to Mexican Cuisine he's not trying to claim it but you know hey this was invented Chicago you know this is not really Mexico PCS saying this is from Mexico we talked openly about the various parts of the country of Mexico where this style of cooking came from and and you knowing how it emanates and it is from the traditional ingredients and he cooks them in traditional ways and it's fantastic like really widely praised restaurant with amazing food and this guy gets hit on for it it's it's crazy cuz it used to be like in the 19th century there was this idea of kind of a pure European culture and other cultures Were Somehow not as good and they Define culture in a very specific way and then back again they're saying no no there's a pure correct culture that only the people born there can you adopt those cultural features that's the complete opposite of what liberals used to RGS the fact that we didn't have as many real problems as we used to and when you talk about Yale with Nick christakis I think this is thing that kids do when they're coming of age they're separated from their parents and they want establish that so many of these older people are wrong about the way life is never wrong we're going to show them what's right we have a new way of living we have a new way of thinking and we want this campus to be safe we want safe spaces and and a lot of it is about in control of their environment and enforcing their ideology and creating something that's in a lot of ways is very ego-driven because they're they're trying to show that they're making a change in the environment around them and they have good intentions while they're doing it it's just their brains haven't fully formed yet and they don't have a lot of life experience and this pattern this pattern shows itself over and over and over again it's a constantly repeating pattern constantly repeating pattern for these kids go away to college and become self-righteous and then try to impose their viewpoints on the older people it's very very comments and it has this these psychological building blocks to add that you can kind of see why they're doing this</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> Trinity College Boy by Meister wrote that great book on evil when she actually went and interviewed serial killers and rapists in prison and said you why'd you do it and discover that they all had this perspective like well this is why I did it I had a crappy childhood or you know how I felt it you know that it was totally justified that guy dismay or she cheated on me or they all had justifications behind their argument if the perpetrator is just pure evil he did it because he enjoys suffering at the suffering of other people now there are some Psychopaths that do that but they're very small and number very tiny percentage of the population most people in prison that are killers they did it for moralistic reasons you know he took my parking spot so I slept with my girlfriend until I had to do something and defend my honor and one thing led to another and here I am in prison they almost moralistic reasoning so the problem is not that we don't have enough morality that actually we have too much morality too much moralizing about other people that are harming us so go back to the Free Speech issue at the moment you say we're going to create a category called hate speech okay what goes in that Ben Brightwell state supreme court to uphold this conviction of this guy named shank he was head of the Socialist Party in Philadelphia in 1918 he was Distributing Flyers to draft age men telling them that the conscription is equivalent of slavery because the 14th amendment protects your right to bodily autonomy and when the government says we're drafting you in the military and we're sending you to Europe this case for the European Great War we now on your body for the next four years okay so this is what so here's the famous lines from Oliver Wendell Holmes Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Schenck versus United States that we're all familiar with the most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic the question in every case is whether the word used are used in such circumstances that are such a nature as to create a clear and present danger but they will bring about the substitution of evils that Congress has a white right to prevent it is a question of proximity and degree so clear and present danger and cause violence or something like that so that's going to be at the time I clear and present danger protesters of the draft and their argument their argument is pretty You can disagree with insano I think in times of national crisis we have to abolish set aside the Fourteenth Amendment and can script young men into the army and send them up toward potentially die that's alright to do it to protect our nation but we should be able to debate that but the moment that happened in 1919 then category creep or category expansion happened where more more things got put into the bin of clear and present danger Community or whatever so that category just got bigger and bigger and then go back to why liberals used to defend free speech and now it's more conservative doing it and Liberals are in favor of censorship begins with this idea of something like in the sixties where we began to become sensitive to the words we use to describe other people so the n word yeah yeah those are all hate speech to the bins starts getting larger and larger then all the sudden you end up with these list of microaggressions I reprint one in the book from UCLA University California system in 2014 issues this long list of things you can't say like where are you from or wow you're good at math to someone who's not Asian or why you speak English so well these are now considered hate speech feelings of being hurt and that is a form of clear danger to the sort of Serenity of our community and I'll send this category is now Hughes where are you from really on that list all the time because she's from Germany and she speaks perfect English has no accent and people go wow I can't believe you speak English so well or well I can't believe you're not from America or something like that and instead of being a Eli paid attention in school</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> talk to you about Michaels there's an article today in the Atlantic which is really interesting it's about technology it's contact tracking technology and this there's a real concern about this stuff first of all the idea is great that if you did this free America from quarantine this is always the risk right the risk is just give up a little bit of your civil liberties give up a little bit of your freedom and we're going to keep you safe and you know what brings you to the old Benjamin Franklin quote you know he who would give up Liberty for Freedom deserves neither neither liberty for safety stocked up that quote but this is very interesting because they're using it in South Korea and then using it in Singapore and the title of the article in the Atlantic is the technology that could free America from quarantine until today and they bring up this conundrum it mean nobody wants to give up civil liberties and civil he's lost her rarely regained and this is the real concern here that if you do allow people to track who you're in contact with and make sure they're okay your testing negative and you're in contact with people that also test negative so you're okay you're okay to travel now like this is this is a very weird thing and it gets very gray area how do you feel about this sort of thing I like privacy and that I do have a right to not be tracked and you know that you can't have cameras in my home or my yard and it's on in general I think across-the-board that's a good principal and Anna follows the Constitution I think there are times I think it is you know we do have a constitution we do have states rights we do have courts that litigate these sorts of things I could see a reasonable measure being taken for let's say we're going to do the following for 6 months until we see what happens with this pandemic and then once that's over then we're going to revert back now let's say the governor or the other presidents has one night going back well then you have courts then we can you sue the state are you sue the federal government for violations of civil liberties and then you can get them back what happened to NSA when Edward Snowden revealed how much tracking is actually going on I mean that's never been yeah yeah I know emails right yes and you know these started abortion so supposedly when Obama became president is like Xena the transparent president so we're going to stop doing that well. That's not the case we wouldn't have known that without. Snowden or the or the Pentagon papers and you know it's good to know what Mutual favorite subjects of conspiracy theories you know we didn't know about a lot of the things Kennedy was doing and Johnson all the way back to Eisenhower line about the Vietnam War for example until the Pentagon papers came out and then in the 90s that church committee on conspiracies from the 70s a lot of those documents were released and there was that that business about the operation Northwoods Kennedy Administration that people brought to him this idea of a false flag operation over Cuba make it look like the Russians were harassing our aircraft are airports as an excuse to invading Cuba or assassinating Castro and so it's like you know like when you had Alex Jones talks about false flag operations and most of us Skeptics doll that's a bunch of nonsense less than a year later right then all the shenanigans of American intelligence agents manipulating elections in South American but he's our son of a b**** anyway how to support the fascist dictator rather than the Communist dictators like what are we doing doing that anyway well that's what we do it's like wait a minute does the public know about this did Congress approve this know okay so you know this is one reason people believe conspiracy theories is because a lot of them were true</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> so you know this is one reason people believe conspiracy theories is because a lot of them are true not all of them with you with the Epstein case like you were one of the first people that mean as a literal you're a professional skeptic and you looked at some of the evidence you like well you know what this might be a conspiracy been enough of them I'm still not sure about that one because after I posted something about the other two cameras broke or whatever somebody wrote me from that prison saying all those cameras are always breaking in a way that Michael Batten the famous autopsy doctor says is completely inconsistent with hanging and much more consistent with someone strangling you include including the actual area where he was hanging from supposedly like it is consistent with someone's trying you from behind not consistent with you hanging by your own weight after Weinstein got his is Harvey Weinstein got his conviction I thought oh boy but they better have a real suicide watch on this guy cuz I had sex with all these starlets and turn them into big celebrities and Cindy I bet he probably doesn't want that out especially this stage of the game nothing I don't think anything he's got going to make him look good and I think the thing with Epstein is he knew way too much about too many powerful people there's just some so many connections it could be made with that guy and that you know to this day people are asking questions that people like Bill Gates don't want to answer prince Andrew or any of these people they like to get you know I don't want to talk about this the gates by prince Andrew of course I flew on the Lolita Express that's the thing is there's so much data and so I mean one of the things that's really sad about the loss of respect for mainstream journalism and mainstream media is what we count can't count on them and who is regulating the independence who's regulating these websites who's regulating these people that are just you know so-called independent journalist they're just tweeting things and finding thinking of putting things up on their website since it's so hard to tell who's telling the truth and who's not and when I was giving the devil his due I had that this was kind of a challenge to me because I feel like there's so much fake news real fake news and bogus theories and in my areas of medicine and cancer cure and I feel like well but I'm a free speech fundamentalist I really believe you have people that short of just lying about somebody or giving away the nuclear codes or something like that thousand flowers bloom and just see what you know what sunlight on all of them and see which ones rise to the top because they're supported by evidence there's a risk to that that is to say no people will take bad information and I'll go shoot up a pizzeria or something that is to say that theory is that 5G is causing people to feel ill to take you out and that the government made up of the corporation's made up the story about the coronavirus as a distraction from 5G stupid and only five countries have 5G Towers why the f*** would you dummies why the f*** is you idiots think that 5G towers are causing covid-19 it's oh yeah you know that was accused with four G in 3-g and you know it is cell phones back in the late 90s and early 2000 there was a scare about you're holding the phone up to your own we all started doing that and that this is may be causing brain tumors and Jay from the cell phone itself or even these 5G Towers is not strong enough to break chemical bonds like DNA to cause mutations in cells to them become cancerous is not a physical mechanism A&amp;B the counter examples that you always have to what about the countries that don't have 5G different options in our Focus tends to be on the one cell so I always use this uristix for my class teaching 2 by 2 Matrix we have for ourselves so I did this with this there's this documentary film coming out about horror films that are haunted or cursed horror films that occur so like the which is the one where the actors died in the helicopter Act of The Twilight Zone The Movie and The Exorcist and the other films were bet you do bad things happen to the actors that are in horror films okay the problem with that is your only focusing on one cell that is horror films that are cursed what then there's horror films that are not cursed nothing bad happened to the actors in those and then there's non horror films regular films which bad things happened to the actors and then none films that are not cursed right someone we just focus on the one so it's easy to find examples that fit it but something like The Shining which is a super horror scary film you're nothing bad happened to the actors and or just take some other film like The Godfather with whatever that's not nothing bad happened you're just bet you just plucking out anecdotes do that cuz they love to believe in spiritual connections and they love to believe in Clairvoyance and they love to believe in haunted things I'm Jamie pull up the article in The Sciences Bill Gates breaks silence on Epstein admitting he made a mistake in judgment by meeting with the pedo Tycoon it says so story about it who knows but he is he is quoted in there yeah I don't know why I know that mean they're so I know some scientists and scientist because he had a lot of money and I can find your lab help help find your lab to the tune of millions of dollars and it's hard to resist that and then maybe you go down that road a little bit and then you start hearing these rumors about his personal life and he was like yeah but the money is good for the lab and what is it was a bad thing and it but it's too late you already went down that road so that when I say it's hard to judge people after the fact in hindsight bias and we look back and go how could anybody I've ever had any association with them it's like yeah but that's the stuff now that maybe not everybody knew the extent of it back years ago</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> shows that when you know somebody say who's gay you're less likely to be homophobic just the exposure to them and so the effect of them up to pass laws to get people to change like to abolish slavery in the United States we needed a war and some 150,000 people died about that and you know sometimes you have to send federal troops like that to desegregate Alabama schools that were segregated and remember the governor you know segregation now segregation tomorrow segregation forever and to make sure you do it sometimes you have to do that most of the change happens from the bottom up of just oppressed peoples saying you know what stop that don't do that I don't like it when you say that and it began with the n-word and just kept expanding where we ended up to today where you have this Big Ben of your microaggressions and so on but there was a logic to it like I'm just saying it's hurtful to do that and most of the effects have been good they've been positive just you know when Ellen comes out on her TV show that. Just a little thing there or when South Park yo makes fun of all different religions you know that perspective on things humor is good television scripts movie scripts the way characters talked you can pinpoint to the decade when a novel was written based on the words that are used to describe Jews blacks and women and but no one said they were going to pass laws to say you can't use these words describe choose by some women we all just change the way we talk about other people in a way that's more liberal that's more all-encompassing that's more egalitarian in that sense and and it's not clear how exactly what happened just incrementally a little bit by bit you know it's just trying to figure out when a word starting to be used it's like it's really hard to 911 or days that I remember in the late nineties there was a couple atheist that wanted to quit using the word atheist atheist and call us the brights we are the brights so that never took off you. Bye-bye trying to change language by Fiat from the top down okay here's the new real we're all going to use this word that doesn't work it's just expanding our consciousness-expanding tomorrow's feared it just including more people in your honorary circle of friends and family members are honorary family members or people that you will treat with respect that that has been happening just tiny bits everyday a little bit here and there and over the decades UCI your people that you will treat with respect that that has been happening just tiny bits everyday a little bit here and there and over the decades you see it when you look back at the numbers like The Thinker does but but it's hard to pinpoint the day that that happened</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> yeah it weird to bring a strange strange moment in history as really is something you got to look at like you said something to me when I asked you last week how you're doing you said you just you're just trying to accept and I think that's the key if you can accept it then you can be proactive about it you can be creative about it you can just take whatever life force you have and and you know look at what what what are the possibilities here don't have any expectations that gets Shattered by reality except what it is or this is a new thing now it stay alive be nice to each other and do your best and try to get through this and hopefully at the other end when science and medicine has gotten a handle on this hopefully we can go back to normal life they'll be wonderful but right now we can't so it is what it is if you just want to run around screaming and hollering and freaking out about it and it's not good what would makes me are concerned than anything is what is life going to be like once the economy rolls back again how many people going to be out of work how many business can be shuttered how many you know how how f***** up is it going to be that gives me the most fear of the unknown because I know that a certain amount of people going to get sick in a certain large percentage of going to get better and unfortunately some people are going to die and all that's awful but I kind of see that that makes sense my mind I kind of see a disease people that that all makes sense what doesn't make sense is an economy that stops and then restarts again I've never seen that so for that I'm like what is that like it is I just know model to base it on because our economy today is so much different than it was you know even 10 years ago the international economy it is it's a it's a digital economy there's so much of it that we don't we don't know how it's going to I was going to play out you know and I know that a lot more people are going to stop going I think that businesses are saying oh we don't need offices for 100% of our people and parking spots know we'll just have 50% of people work from home like we just did for the last 3 months at work that would be very cost-effective for people that don't want to have gigantic offices and then also how freed how much Freedom it is if you you can work from home I mean for a lot of people if that's possible that would definitely be preferable Hellyeah I can tell you from writing on TV shows over the years has been some that I've written from home you know what I'm like a consultant that's just handing them I do so much more work when I have to actually hand it in through an email that when I'm sitting in a writers room with 12 other people throwing out of line once an hour on meeting f****** Sushi I mean I work my ass off because I got it yes that's a good point think about that in terms of creation of material one thing I've been guilty of over the last month I've been written Jax yet I might have a couple ideas I wrote down but I really have been riding when I haven't been doing stand-up and I decided what I wanted to do is I want to know what my take on this is the best way I can figure out what my take on it is is just have a natural take on it like actually go through this and and find out what it is first how long it's going to last what what are you what are your thoughts on this and at the beginning I didn't know my thoughts on at work because my thoughts on or stay safe make sure family stay safe friend stay safe you know do whatever you're supposed to do and let's find out how long is going to take what are the experts say talk to some experts what it what's the prognosis look like keeps getting pushed back now it's June have the same June things going to restart June like f*** was that like what is that like for people that are Check to Check 3 months April May June when when is it when is it go back 3 months from now and it's already been a month you know what went what day do june what am I doing 14 you got more cases then what do we do when we do we ever say f*** it was just go back to work what is that like what kind of drunken Wild West parties go back to work and start going back to bars and a different I'll be out in a bar in a nightclub how many people can be pregnant when is this all goes back this going to be a giant loads but we need to make s*** in the way that doesn't destroy the environment and one of the ways they are able to make s*** in other countries is then on the same regulations environmental regulations as they do here that's always been the big problem with shipping stuff overseas they also don't have the same regulations like when the Foxconn Scandal came out and they found out there was gnats around the building to keep people from play where we met, we have the person who makes them makes good living you know the back of the old days when these two have like great cars were made in Detroit they're all made in Detroit and Detroit was his huge City Detroit was one of the richest cities in the country cuz everything got shipped overseas or everything got shipped to two different places the unions are a great Theory they have work well in a lot of ways but they also have huge problems and if there's got to be a way to get unions back in place that can guarantee people health coverage and retirement without making a cost of doing business so high that it hurts the industry I don't know jackshit about finances so I don't know whether not receiving comments on that but it would be nice if he worked it out make s*** in America where we don't have to worry about things going down and let's let's learn from this to learn from this and start making medicine over here why is all the medicine made in China what do we need to balance out we need to balance out for some sort of apocalyptic event we got to be prepared what's necessary and what's luxury and we're getting we're keeping it simple and they're going to come out of it having a better gauge of what each of us needs individually as a country military out of the population don't know ventilators yeah yeah there's a lot of possibles out there that was the things that we wish we were shipping stuff overseas they just destroyed something today that like we were sending metal medical equipment to other countries oh we got stupid about Thailand we were actually shipping stuff to Thailand right now and then it was some kind of mix-up in the government's apologizing about it now</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> do you think Ferguson and khabib will go down something happens this weekend just in case she's a monster Justin gaethje is a monster he's a monster cetera find individual he is mean in a sport that violent it's an inherently violent sport he stands out as the most violent I mean you watched his knockout of Edson Barboza you watch out that m*********** attacks people he's there's a reckless abandon to his his calculated wildness that is a terrifying he's something special and he's better all the time the question is how much has he been training you taking a fight on very short notice to taken Define essentially two weeks notice also might be kind of weird to train now and is Coronavirus times training Partners I don't know who I respect very much said that Fighters shouldn't be fighting because I don't know what you said they shouldn't be fighting but he said if they do definitely felt it wasn't fair the fighters because they they don't have a full camp and not going to be able to show who they really are. It's a really good point this is you know awhile situation where there's a guy who's going to fight for the interim title he gets to call let me that's also how Nate Diaz beat Conor McGregor and their first fight remember that that was 11 days out they call Nate Diaz he's eating tacos f****** drinking tequila in Mexico and probably doing triathlons but out of shape like you were I would get but for Justin gaethje really depends entirely on how much time you spend in the gym now he's the plan right he's trying to be the UFC lightweight champion so he's probably not getting too out of shape and he probably knew that in this case there is a potential that one of those guys could drop out because they already made that fight for f****** times and it fell apart this is the fifth time it's falling apart which is nuts crazy so it might be the Justin gaethje knew that this was a possibility that he could be called in as a replacement he might be in full Camp mode we really don't know we have to talk to him, turn you all along with probably getting ready but I'd love to see him fight and there's a lot of guys that have been through a full camper there paid for a full camp and they're paid to make weight this is something that's happened several times in the UFC's history we're guys show up because they're their 222 fight and step in if something falls apart especially if you have a guy who made maybe struggles with weight cutting and you might fall apart and get pulled from fight or someone is may be injured or sick and I like a little nervous with this fine we're getting super fights every week we're getting super fights every week do you think on the island</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> here's a better one Epstein FC's killer that's one nobody thinks that that got hung himself no one how about that guy so if you have various theories are various stories that people come out and talk about with that one yeah and I just actually yesterday listen to Eric Weinstein solopod guessing Jeffrey Epstein I would have been faster in the city because Eric is too smart he's almost like to smart is one of those guys you talk to him I call you poor bastard you're burdened your burden trying to make sense of the world around Apes it Alex and all the trauma of in the yet like we were talking about he still also the 13 the twenty-year-old kid so you seeing he had a few run-ins with authority which makes it which makes him suspicious of authority and I think the r life experience Define that so you can see I've seen in a lot of different ways depending on how you've experienced if you were there tainted a lot of people's reputations basically if you took a picture with them your reputation is Tainted I do think that he was an exceptionally Charming person so he was good Amino the devil's going to be Charming so and the other thing is he genuinely showed curiosity towards scientific ideas even out there big scientifically especially if you ever thought about that intelligence operative intelligence operative part of his job to try to infiltrate the scientific communities and there must have been a directive if he really is an intelligence operative is not like they like hey interest belgians having sex with underage girls you can't be that or the idea of that Erik Bush's Fault by the way I'm talking to him on the podcast I do tomorrow which is why I'm talking about him a lot of preparing for like a three-hour conversation Eric Weinstein which will kill most you have to call people out in their b******* which is very hard to do with their Quest then I checked out ten minutes is that theory I'm so far behind I try to keep up but recognize and I'm not going through and then go back and then listen to it again I hate putting stuff into words simply allergic to saying simple stuff because it's not Bute Woody so he always liked drenches everything in humor and wit and thus like beautiful language was initiated when he's describing complex things he describes him to people that understand complex things. But that's also me this is a criticism is he almost he hates explaining the basics of something hit he just skips ahead right even for the initiated nice to go to the basics. Explain like what are the ground we're standing on skips right into the depth of things which is beautiful but sometimes requires you to listen fall thing is a mess up on the part of the intelligent so they didn't know they didn't know and I know that he felt like he get me remember when this was all started out when he started out doing that it was all before social media right so he probably thought that he had this incredible amount of power because of the fact that he was connected and by the intelligence Community if he was he probably thought he could get away with it makes you wonder you thought that he had this incredible amount of power because of the fact that he was connected by the intelligence Community if he was he probably thought he could get away with it makes me wonder all the horrible things that happened in this world before social media before the spread of information was crazy</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> LOL X you might be wondering why what I'm wearing on my face I'm not wondering no no coronavirus time everybody so I'm assuming that's what you wearing on your face scientific study of how effective bras aren't filtering around that have put together a survey paper showing that masks work it started as a movement called Max fall #in the Czech Republic that's essentially one of the critical components of stopping the spread of coronavirus is everybody has to wear masks and the Sciences to fold so I mean I need to break this part but cuz there's an audio if you can't get it so much better nice so the before-and-after so you probably shouldn't be wearing a mask when you do podcast definitely not but everywhere else yes that's homemade masks work so there's a shortage of n95 respirator masks which should be exclusively used as PPE personal protective equipment by healthcare workers okay there's also a shortage of surgical masks which are these non-woven fabric masks that work very well for the thing I'm talking about but because there's a shortage of them we should not be buying them and should be saving them for healthcare workers and then open question was whether homemade masks like the one I just described work to stop as a filtration mechanism this is a confusing thing for the individual Centric society that we live in masks are the most what are they actually effective for what they're effective for is to prevent me if I'm infected asymptomatic from spreading the infection to you so that's where the movement of masks for all started which is your mask protect me my mask protects you and that year there is is not I'm not protecting I'm not creating a wall from the Restless I am contributing to the opposite of the bigger aggregate picture of it by not allowing infection to spread so masks is masks allow you to reduce that transmission rate to 1 to blow one so how long you to decrease the transmission rate while also long people to be in public before businesses I know boo Han is back up in business again but there's a lot of criticism about that and they're also saying they're seeing new cases I think the question I think you can be sooner than we think if we do the following things so one I'd hate to linger on this I'd love to talk to you about it but I'll make fun of you right back but just like fanny packs are exceptionally functional to carry on the things you need masks will be massive acquired slow the spread of this infection and would like one of the things start getting Governor's so politicians to wear them at our President Trump to wear them well this is the Boris Johnson and he was talking about you openly now he's in intensive care if he dies that will be the biggest wake-up call for everyone mean I hope he doesn't die but God damn people told me over there I don't know his policies I don't know I don't know I haven't been anyone in a long time I don't know how I feel about him but f*** people some people hate him that I would like saying things like they're hoping he dies he suffers and dies I've read oil the guy wrote woke Tatiana McGrath yeah is he but it was actually his own personal account he published some of the tweets of people have written about you don't have to put it up there I don't want up these people signal but it's just so heartless so yeah that's masks but testing really masks besides like washing hands masks testing and contact tracing so I don't know what it's like an open question what does it take to do that will you can't like that there's a strange effect to it at any other factors as a as an individualistic Society you wearing a mask not to protect yourself but but to protect others and that's the weird thing for us to do the truth that the that this is a nice positive as me wearing a mask says I care about not getting it's a really powerful social signal for when you're hanging hang out with people I think it's going on though I don't think people were just a large percentage of people is my assumption that are wearing that mask that are not wearing it because they think they're going to protect other people they're worried about getting it and I don't think who in the CDC this is where I I hate what they're doing with which is sort of there's truth and that there is ideas of how the truth will be misinterpreted by the public and so you shouldn't tell people the truth so there's a kind of sense like The Who and cdcf said that masks don't work for example or they said that we should be wearing Masters you say them for the healthcare workers at the beginning of the year World Health Organization set on the podcast yesterday it's terrifying stuff and you know and obviously newspapers were going off of that information and they were printing misleading stuff as well and the president didn't know no one know what's at the whole thing is very weird if you're if you're going based on what they were saying it didn't look like it's going to be nearly as bad as it is and then everyone has had to make adjustments I'm actually one I'm so freaked out about the loss of life and the loss of jobs and how people getting SIDS it's it's really weird that everything about it is weird it's weird In Our Lifetime to be a part of something that's just affecting the entire world like this but I've got a lot of messages from friends that are quarantined with their families and like we've never been closer and that we realize that we're in this together because we realize that you know during these crazy times you you realize what is important love that's Lord you were talkin about love and community and friendship make my neighbors have one so nice that one's way even now and everyone's like saying hi and you know talking from Over the side of the yard and how's everything you guys are right and anything we're right here there's a lot of this like comfort and warmth that you know I think I experienced a little bit of that post 9/11 where people get shocked they get shook up and then they realize what matters you know about masks it feels like you're protecting yourself from like you're removing yourself to me there's that look and we're going to wait for me dirty people get away from me so that a germaphobe kind of idea that's not what they are supposed to represent but that I'm sitting here on the science that says we have to all wear them and then thinking like how is that going to change interactions you're removing yourself with me there's a look and I can't wait for me dirty people get away from me so the germaphobe kind of idea that's not what they are supposed to represent but that I'm sitting here on the sign that says we're after all wear them and then thinking like how's that going to change interactions</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> the virus thing just made me think they got something to my dad a lot about my by my grandfather and just brought it and made it so real to me cuz I studied the World War II a lot especially the Holocaust and all that but they like the fact that just learning about my grandfather just made it so real to me it kind of connected everything together plus there's a book I recommend people read is by Albert Camus the plague that he wrote right after what is I don't know if you know if he is he's like an existentialist philosopher existentialists believe that you know you have to live like life is absurd Life Is Life is suffering and there's no meaning to it all you just have to live the moment and take take each moment as it comes and live it to the fullest kind of kind of idea so he described this town that got overtaken by the plague in the book The Bike and that kind of similar to bubonic plague basically similar characteristics and writes about how everybody's reacts in different ways the main character is a doctor who basically sees the the absurdity of the suffering around him that there's no meaning to it all the sad thing about the virus like with the Nazis and with Wars there's an enemy you can kind of Trace back and understand what was happening with the virus it just seems like you can't come I know where it breaks the spine of the way we think of regular life like some people try to cling on to regular life as if nothing is happening which by the way it's kind of like what a lot of our society is doing right now we're not yet we haven't really felt the pain yet and hopefully won't but there's this kind of dumb the Calm before the storm kind of. And then some people become like more religious they start to search for the bigot meaning of life the material possessions and then the doctor represents the idea that no matter what he he gives themselves fully to his to his craft of helping other human beings and overall there's a story that this idea that suffering is just part of life and the only way there's a natural Temptation when this cruelty and suffering all around you to isolate yourself at 2 to withdraw from life because anything you do in life is going to lead to suffering you know dating like if you get married is going to lead to suffering because eventually you going to lose to the people you love so there's a natural desire to withdraw but in fact what she found the doctrine what he saw around him is that love and compassion like giving yourself fully to the love of other human beings until Community is the only way to what that kind of stuff right but to me it's a really profound story about like about love being the right response in a time of Crisis cell crisis in a crisis that hits everybody that you want to kind of hide from it but it actually were more suffering happens so it's a kind of profound book that Rihanna that I recommend people read most people have read like in Hemet High School for this book called The Stranger but that one in particular seems so connected to an allegory for World War so the plague in that case is the Nazis that it just hits out of nowhere and his book is really popular in 1947 he wrote it World War II I wait to talk about these at the virus that first infects the rats and then affects the week or humans and affects everybody it was the connection and then allegory analogy to the the Nazis and so I saw the connection between now and and the Nazis of course the scale there was World War II was much more intense and and finally just how like fragile this whole damn thing is like that my grandfather had probably is your percentage chance of living you know like most people died most soldiers died in the early years of 19th 1941 when the Nazis basically Stalin was using Russian soldiers and just human beings as human Shields the actress through bodies at the problem so the fact that my dad my grandfather survived his crazy like and I do all these things I'm here talking to you wearing a stupid I like all of that is connected to like he somehow survived all those look really affects me doing research you know I hope compact billions people one day you know think that those like a little Ripple effects on how fortunate I am to be part of that I need is just all seem to be connected to me call those look real Ripple effects me doing research you know I hope to impact like billions people one day you know think that those like a little Ripple effects on how fortunate I am to be part of that I need is just all seem to be connected to me</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> she gotten a little before that it was Elon about about I think you said that the Tesla said something bad about Tesla not being good about tycoons about Porsche tycan cine lens that is very unimpressed with them but as you reminded me with me and somebody replied with a meme of not a meme a real video of Bill Gates jumping over a chair and they said I don't know I find him impressive and you can't he'll answer yeah that's pretty impressive Tech CEOs of major companies that have the I can be silly like that but you don't use it you don't mean I don't mean it in a positive way sweater with a collared shirt underneath a nerd as somebody as an ideal of a man you're an idiot like I was never like that about a lot of things now you're saying that but about is that science is not admired and ways cuz I've seen the alternative inspiration Soviet Union the way people admire scientists the way they admire great athletes great great creators of all kinds and nerd sometimes diminishes that and in ways that it it seems like a peculiar cork of a human being is just like it's a bit connected to like you know going to Comic Con conventions kind of Nerd VS dork dork dork is rarely positive dorf is good if it's. Self-deprecating car Salvador cost to f****** dork but it's very rare that dork is positive Wars nerd is often positive nerd is like guys science nerd heavy heavy like that's a fun way of saying someone's really smart about a certain thing but but I don't think the way around that is to eliminate words or even using certain words I think the way around that is just appreciate people that are really great at science that's the way around that it's not the words don't really matter its perceptions that matter and I don't I don't think necessarily that science has a bad perception it just doesn't have a glamorous enough perception how many people can name Oscar winners that are just really good at lying there's really good Pretenders but how many people can name Nobel Prize winners in science is very few right exactly and I guess the thing I was also speaking to and definitely keep using the word it doesn't preventing words is what to do with week that I always hated as a person who loves fighting like I like the appreciate like am I like the fact that people complimenting sort of the the pursuit of your scientific curiosity that is great but I just never liked it's good to think I've experienced in this country is nerd as an image is seen as weakness I could get to get picked on and I was and always annoyed me because give me intelligence and annoy me annoy me like lean into it like most people I know are kind of like don't work out much and it and it kind of lean into that idea those people workout is like I don't want to get into their thing those people suck they were always mean to me something like that you kind of create a narrative where like Jiu-Jitsu or fighting is like a brute thing just like you talked about with Greek statues having small penises barbarians with their big penises have a big penis dislike the same thing you don't want a guy with a woman or a guy you don't want a woman who's hot and smart you know it sounds like when people think of really beautiful women they automatically assume that woman's dumb and off of times that is not the case sometimes people just have awesome bone structure and if they you know stimulated themselves mentally if they pursued things that they had an interest in certain scientific or you know esoteric ideas and you things that they had an interest in certain scientific or you know esoteric ideas and you underestimated them you would be Bill really humiliated for super smart but super hot girl put you in your place let you know not only am I hot but tomorrow you stupid</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> CNN article that was wondering how long it's been around there were saying see if you can find this was covid-19 around Inhumans longer than is currently believed they think it might have existed for months. Years before it broke loose and became a pandemic mutate because it didn't read the article yeah where'd you learn that CNM Library news folks it's the news leading scientist tell CNN that it's what they listen to CNN but they they have perception that other people don't agree with just like everybody else but it may have existed in humans many months even years before it grew into a deadly pandemic CNN's Nick Paton Walsh reports Bellacino's not doing a good job I decide I think the entire will they doing bad the incentives like they're they're choking out the investigative deep investigative journalism this is exactly you said that the clickbait like like look at the title look at the I think they're trying to stay alive but yeah but that's that's a problem I think it is a problem but I think in the defense of particulate online journalism trying to stay alive I don't think it's good time for journalism now I'm bleeding but I from what I understand the only thing that keeps New York Times functional is the podcast the podcast that broadcast it's huge and that the podcast runs a lot of money but that's not that means they need to innovate they needs to be they need to because of the cast we need the f****** York Times though the problem they need to figure out a way to make money off of it but we need we need the top of the food chain journalism right and that's what the x is always we need them so when someone is someone's done something for the times as not-so-good or flawed yeah okay but still not there. That one person that one article whatever it is is not the X the X stands for something right with the New York Times as supposed to stand for what what it always did when I was a kid and now to a lot of people still it's the cream-of-the-crop it's the very best journalism it's the very best is the ones that have the deepest inside the ones that nail It and Weep free of bias but there's by humans you know this is the problem CNN is the problem with any new source but we still need new sources but it's run by humans they need High salaries and there's a huge amount of people involved in making that system that is a CNN so there's several mechanisms acquired first like this podcast here podcast in general require very few people to run now that there's an infrastructure to communicate with a lot of people and then the Wikipedia model like Wikipedia is thousands of contributors that creates extremely strong factual information that's not like this is very little money required to run Wikipedia incredibly so so that there are some out there that are online though that are thriving because of the problems with Legacy Media it's an opportunity it represents YouTube temples of fantastic journalists he's he's really objective you might disagree with them or you might not find his perspective to be in the line with yours but that guy is he holds those journalistic ethics at the highest level to the highest standard with him it's everything and when you read his take on or see him make it take on things he is giving you the most honest objective take on it possible and really hard to get that from a network first of all through the hard to get what he does for a network because you're going to get these giant chunks where he'll heal he can talk about something for as long as it takes to describe what the issue is where is CNN has a segment man that's taking his f****** 7 minutes while you better be done by 7 minutes Trump is bad coronavirus deadly and holyshit Chris Cuomo's got it let's go to Chris he's in his basement and then see Christmas basement with Sanjay Gupta and they're holding up chest x-rays you know they think they have their segments man segments are b******* it's dumb you have these standards that you've created a long f****** time ago and this is the biggest handicap that Legacy Media has other than their inability to be free like a guy like Tim pool is there not independent they can't be free like he is you have too many working pieces too many producers too many people there telling you what the directions say this people that bring you the segments you're a talking head is a lot of s*** going on there man lot of s*** going on there but you have to innovate and make more you need to Aspire to it and not be polluted by other influences but I can see people like I think I'm objective but I have very different views than Tim pool on some things and not others actively so you looking at a thing of Jack till you're being honest about what what it says but you also have preconceived notions of what each individual aspect of that certain thing means and what's good what's bad that's where the subjective aspect of objectivity comes in when you look at certain things that happened there certain ways you can look at something and not have a bias but look at something and you have a preconceived idea of what aspects of it should or should not be tolerated and maybe times it takes someone else to come along so kill why do you hold these beliefs is yet you're absolutely right but the problem is that based on your skill set and your momentum in history you might look at a very particular aspect objectively and not see the bigger picture for sure like Tim pool has revealed and his focus on certain aspects of problems in the system and he continues to focus on them maybe not seeing the bigger picture that's impossible for anyone to see the bigger picture I think like I tend to I-10 to see in a lot of things the beauty of things and it does focus on the positive I focusing on and also the other thing is choosing the ways you talk about it so Louise you reveal that objectivity B+ and B- he can be very cold and fact-based you can be very flamboyant and very kind of excited that use a lot of visual with all those kinds of things in all of that changes the way the message is carried the void that's been created by this distrust and Legacy Media especially now. I don't know if you been paying attention but like YouTube there's so many people like my brother is not like put the camera themselves right and say their opinions that's crazy. It's over million I think it's kind of a lockdown Chronicles I think it's it's a symbol of where we're going right it's your you're becoming but when I do this thing I'm doing this thing for 5 days a week and I'm becoming more connected with people in some weird way that no one ever thought it was ever going to happen before where there's people that listen to my voice right now in their ear while they're running right a lot not a small amount if you could see the actual number of people right now with earbuds in running listening to this podcast ubill at whoa that's kind of crazy they hard you're running into the next Dimension that's what this is and it seems like it wasn't it seems like go on the internet then somewhere along the line came this weird thing that's what it is Now podcast for a weird thing especially one that reaches the numbers of people that this one reaches and for that to be in my hands is a weird position and I'm you know why what's happening 100-count f****** strange this is I didn't anticipate this I always anticipated this being some weirdo Fringe thing that very few people would connect with which line ever tried to censor it at all I tried to do a vast majority of it completely High out of my mind and hang out with fun fun people just talk s*** and have a good time and not have a different perspective some people have a public voice and a private voice. Try to have the same voice just be me just just do that Dad so I tell people when they say what was Joe like behind the scenes that be awesome if you're totally different almost like a super dick behind the scenes yeah yeah that be a bummer or like a totally different person like you put on that mini skirt and this is just one step that we didn't think was a step it's a podcast I thought it was just like a radio show that you doing the internet but it's not into the way humans are going and this is just one step that we didn't think was a step it's a podcast I thought it was just like a radio show that you doing the internet but it's not for some reason it's more involved and more entangled and more intense and then and then also it has an impact right</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Healthcare in this is a healthcare issue obviously is so complicated and there's so many levels to it but it means I think one of them that we really have to dress is died in obesity there's a giant problem with diet and obesity in this country healthy food eating eating the proper food and you don't have a friend who said that they were talking about people who do drugs and people who drink and you know maybe they should access to those same Healthcare and maybe that's a good incentive to stop people from drinking and doing drugs and I said yeah what about people do fat what are people who are fat but you're going to use the same logic with them because you can't sat Jame so can you tell hate hate that so you can't get the same Healthcare that a healthy person does well if you get a healthy person who likes to drink and they did run and they did a job but they do like to drink and occasionally smoke a cigarette what are they fear than someone who's morbidly obese yes they are so why would we have a problem is people who don't self-care with a giant problem with that people who don't take the necessary steps personally now is this because of education is it because of ignorance is it because of a lack of awareness of the consequences of an unhealthy diet or eating poor Foods or consuming large amounts of alcohol or tobacco product I don't know what it is but that is a massive part of our Healthcare System is people who are not doing the proper things to their own body in terms of eating nutritious Foods hopefully they can afford in terms of exercise which is free for everybody and there's a lot of things you can do there free to take care of your body chapter 7 in my book I forgot I got to talk about my book and you know part of the part of the deal when we when we are founders wrote out the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and in and built the framework for this free society that we live in where government's role is to protect your rights as fundamentally the government's role you have god-given rights and these are life liberty property effectively speaking life liberty and property Kristen wrote The Pursuit of Happiness and they choose these words really carefully now part of the exchange there is is a necessity for citizens to live with a sense of Duty and to live as a citizen that this idea of citizenship and to do what is right to do what is good it's hard for me to imagine that people are just so uneducated that they don't know that they're unhealthy you know I think I think problem and you're getting it that problem I don't know if that's true I don't think it's that they don't care I think they have no discipline I don't think it's that they don't care there's there's a difference if they'd never been taught to push themselves there's a lot of people it's just so easy to guess that's one of the reasons why I love the title of your book fortitude is what people need and also they need to understand that there's a great value and doing difficult things and this what's it what chapters that is it what do something hard for you will listen man that's like you're a Navy SEAL on you you know it you got it you live it this is what we need we need more people who understand that I know it's hard to get up I know it's hard to do things I know it it's hard for me to but I still do want and you should do them to me it should be something that we encourage everyone to do and that we we all talk and then we all praise each other for and we all get excited about accomplishing these things and taking care of your physical body taking care of your meat vehicle if everybody just did that we would have his health care cost this country will be radically decreased about the fact that they took care of themselves and then had discipline to not overeat and had discipline to to try to choose a foods and to make a meal plan write things down made it can be done this we're not talking about breathing underwater we're talking about things that can be done by the average person like the notion of personal responsibility is talked about enough as it it's almost all the time immoral and I'm feeling and uncaring when we say you know when this whole I go to tell everybody to be pulled ourselves up by their bootstraps and whatever in like not that we use that term but but the point is is that actually important I don't think conservatives have done a good enough job over time explaining why it's so important and personal responsibility troll our own destiny it's if you're constantly in victimhood if you're constantly being told that that you can't control your own destiny that's fundamentally disempowering that's a terrible psychological states and what exact question is do you do you have or things that happen to you or are they within your control or outside your controller it's something like that in Germany the answer was was overwhelmingly things are happening to them outside of their control right like like you understand what I'm saying 3% of people said yes versus in Germany was like 50 or 60% believe we are in control of our own destiny we tend to overwhelmingly say more than European countries that if we work hard and and and play by the rules and do what's right that we will get ahead that we will find that opportunity and I think if you could immigrate right now what's your number one destination will it's the US of a like overwhelmingly the second place is Canada and Germany at like 6% of respondents the USA is like 21% of respondents the second place isn't even close and so for all of the left-wing like anger and and always saying prevalent for all this for all of that commentary it's it just it's just isn't true and so in any of the reason that use crisis language Okay the reason they tell you're going to die in 10 years climate change the reason they're always telling you that corporations are taking advantage of you in the 1% is just all of this policies put into place and you can't justify you can't justify revolutionising the whole system unless you convince people that the system is so bad and so corrupt that it needs to be revolutionized and created is undermining of this notion of personal responsibility if you're going to convince them that they need you to save them to me do you know each to each to their need each to their ability what you're telling people is that they don't have to work that hard but they deserve they have rights to all of these other services from other people it's their right we should distribute out accordingly everybody's perfectly equal what that does is it removes agency from people and it's truly a disempowering thing and we seen this throughout the throughout history because they just want to work hard and move up and they're just so excited about this meritocracy that we've that we've that we've built into our into our culture 8-bit about how communist Cubans come to America in the moment they step foot on soil they become Republicans it's really hilarious that it's true and they do appreciate that that aspect of this country I think you said earlier is that we live in the best time ever in history and I agree with that the consequences of it being such a great time or it's far easier to get by because it's far easier to get by people look for things to be more difficult than they actually are they look for things to be more stacked against them than they actually are they look for more of a woe-is-me standpoint when you find people that actually have a real difficult life they look for things to be hard they find hard things everywhere they look and often times you find those people that have a real struggle that it's a great documentary called Happy People by Werner Herzog it's about people live in Siberia and it is a brutal difficult existence in extreme cold but these people are overwhelmingly happy and it is really crazy documentary because their physical and their struggle just existence just to survive is so difficult that they found the sort of perfect vibration of existence where they're in the wilderness they're out there trapping and hunting and fishing and and farming and in and Gathering up enough food to survive in the extreme Winters and it's it it really shows you that human beings need difficult tasks we need things to be tough to do and we need to we go out there and do them to have a feeling of satisfaction and have a feeling of personal responsibility and the fact that you've actually done the things that you needed to do in order to survive it's built into us cuz I wouldn't wish that upon anybody I'm not saying you need to get blown up in the face and lose an eye to have the sort of Spiritual Awakening and how good it feels to go through something hard but you should you should have bitchily move into a a self-imposed suffering you're about to say something that have gone through as military or First Responders really difficult physical tasks to get to where you you are just that alone creates character creates a different kind of person and the type of people that gravitate towards those Endeavors those dishes they're special people they are but I didn't write this book for them and for everybody and Glisan seals have our hard thing and it's buds underwater demolition / SEAL training at 6 months of hell and it is it pushes you beyond limits you you ever thought you had hell week especially when you're done with that when you when you come away from hell week there really is the sort of Spiritual Awakening that you have higher confidence you feel prepared for anything even in the some of the worst situations you can think to yourself well it's not quite hell week is it much more perspective relaxing in perspective quite a bit also chapter 2 is is called perspective from Darkness Highpoint the stock doubt that too many of us have have gotten so comfortable we we removed suffering from our life to such an extraordinary degree and that's not a bad thing that's an element of the modern times that we live in and I'm happy we live there but the reality in my life I'm complaining because when I'm at 30,000 ft flying through the air to Wi-Fi isn't as fast as I'd like it to be like so we have very different complaints and it's good to every once in awhile just think you know what I have a pretty damn good and to remind yourself of that again to do something hard chapter is it's one of the Deep dive into the psychological literature which I just enjoy doing there's a or the Bible with all of these all of these texts these these ancient pieces of wisdom that have been around for a very long time they all talk about this bill talk about the value of suffering the value of enduring an Archer how this build character and it's actually quite literally makes you stronger and do something with a metaphysical sense in a psychological sense and a physical what hardship actually does but physically and metaphysically like those real real benefits to this but you have to do with Joe Rogan's wife because their true life experiences to bolster those those lessons but it just has to be harder than what you did yesterday and maybe it's physical you feel tougher the rest of the day there's you like you know what I just sat and 10 minutes of icy cold water I didn't do that the day before but I did it today and now I feel a little bit more like a badass like you know what I feel like it's small things it's this self-imposed suffering is so important for a lot something and I'm just saying you have to find that in and make it habitual can't just be warrants either the seals can gets off to we we all know that if you know we know who those guys are and because they stopped stopped listening from the value of self-imposed you have to find that in and make it habitual can't just be warrants either cuz he gets off to we we all know that if you know we know who those guys are and it's because they stopped that they stopped listening from the to the lessons from buds into the value of self-imposed suffering</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> so what's your take on what we're going through right now Dan for everybody in the future this is day it's basically a month into like extreme coronavirus lockdown for the country at all started sort of in the beginning of March now here we are in the first week of April and everybody stir-crazy and weirded out by this including me and I'm sure you as well what would it what is your take on this wow weekend where everything all of a sudden shift that it was the March 14th weekend I remember that weekend cuz it was my birthday and I remember how everybody was basically still going out to bars and restaurants and then all of the sudden everything changed I think the entire Paradigm chain and a long time how we got there might my general take on it we we are in a what I would call a tactical Retreat so many is a military term there to describe what we are doing we all of the sudden ran into a hail of gunfire okay like I think about this in military terms of gunfire we're not really sure what hit us we have a basic idea we know who they are we know the General Lee what the enemy is but we weren't quite sure how to combat it talk to anybody don't don't touch anybody to maintain that social distancing lock things down as a slow the spread in allow our backup are far help Public Health System to catch up at a certain point we have to come out of that tactical pause we have to come out of that Retreat and start engaging in the enemy a little bit and we do that slowly we do it carefully and so I think that's the I like to look at it that way into a risk mitigation strategy and we're ramping up our production of things like ventilators of PPE testing capability in order to do that there's some talk of when this is going to end and I don't know how you even make that distinction how how does one make a decision and it seems like one of those things were once it starts once you lock a country down and tell people stay away stay home. work don't do anything unless it's very Central at grocery stores hospitals media there's a certain things are allowed to be done right now when is that end and how does one decide when that ends from the public health perspective I hear them say certain things like after 14 days of a downward Trend in cases than we can start reopening AR is less than 1 then you can start reopening so are being less than one man very contagious person they infect less than one other person right now that numbers are at just over to okay so there's there's an obvious spread that occurs using those as our standards I would like to see a fuse other standards as well such as are we at a point where were testing and we have enough ventilators and little bit space and PPE to actually fight the virus alongside reopening our society because we cannot indefinitely walk down those costs are enormous and 401ks in our jobs can't do much needed surgeries procedures because you know what's called an elective surgery is going to be kind of agraria it's a lot of stuff isn't getting done from public health side into account elective surgery is going to be kind of agraria a lot of stuff isn't getting done from the public health side jobs there's divorce rate for suicide we have to really take all of this into account as we as we talked about 1 to reopen Society</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> yeah I feel it resilience is almost like a muscle it's something that you can build and it's also something they can get soft and I think that I look I love Comfort don't get me wrong but I don't appreciate it unless I've done something difficult you know if you look at like all the different things I do and say all you real productive and it's nice dude I also like to watch TV I like to put my feet up I like to kick back like to have a beer I like to relax but I don't like to relax if I'm not doing s*** I know me and I get mad at me if I'm not doing anything I don't like me when I'm not productive but when I am productive I also can enjoy to relax I enjoy relaxation and I don't enjoy it unless I've learned it and I think that's what people need to do these you need to earn their comfort of Shame I already know all this because it's true all right now I'm I'm I'm trying to give these lessons out in the clear and coherent kind of fun way but these things are just rude you feel bad when you don't act the way you envision yourself to be but you have this hero archetype I talked about your architect for you have this idea of like what you think is the right way to be you're trying to live up to that all time we often fail make your own if you've seen how how successful people are in your like I want to be like that maybe doing comedy or fighting or whatever it is I feel like they have a way of doing something that maybe I should mendicancy built this overtime and you know when you you know only you know really when you when you don't meet that standard we don't meet that standard there should be a degree of shame that you feel this is a problem I viewed in society anymore it's almost the opposite and it went when you do when you don't feel bad shame you can't feel a sense of Duty to be that citizen that we talked about earlier and I find this to be a big problem that you know what the small stuff like examples in the book like you should feel shame when you're that person who doesn't put the shopping cart in a little shopping cart section parking lot but like why won't you just want to just put it away and worse and if you don't put it away because you're in a rush you know because your kid is screaming and if you have a good reason not to put it away but the question to ask yourself is did you feel bad about it right did you feel bad about it and if you didn't feel bad about it what the hell is wrong with you this makes him mad at us like a damn easy to do just just put it back b**** just walk it over there put it in the little stall and you feel better like look I did it I seen what I do I bring all the way the fuk back to the supermarket, I put it back in the front steps take much time and I feel like I did something even if it's just a trick the grocery store doesn't even have to put those little sections out in the parking lot they could just tell you to put it walk it all the way back on the door. The reason why I like the little stalls is cuz of people that do have kids if there's a mom and she's got a baby with her gray give her an out a way out or hire some kid to gather those things up while people are walking out with them fine but if you're just a guy and you know you're shy for yourself and you don't put your car back f*** you you knowing that sense of shame that you're talkin about that there really is important people need to feel shame if you've come up short like that because you can do better you can do better and you should want to do better the way to get back the way to get ahead in life is to do everything that way the way you do everything is the way you do anything the way you do anything is the way you do everything with me that's really what it is if you just do the right do it the way you're supposed to do it you can do it and you'll feel better if you were supposed to get a workout in today like to sleep in and get your ass up and do it and you'll feel better when it's done you like damn I did it I can do this tomorrow to you can and its momentum and just developing that momentum it's a skill it's like everything else it's like learning how to be polite it's like learning how to be cordial learning how to be a nice person these are learn things you can't except that you're a piece of s*** and this is just the way you are no just look at yourself as if you were another person judging you like as if you are a person who's like a life coach judging you what would you tell you to do the psychology behind it but the problem is his like we've I feel like we've removed shame in our culture 2 to a huge extent to wear towards the most celebrated to you know to do these wrong things and one part I do bring up the example of of of how we view you know assistants on government assistance and there's the movie Cinderella Man where Russell Crowe plays the whatever the name is a boxer but we also believe that you shouldn't take it if you don't need it that seems like a pretty good good piece of in a civic duty to live by and experience leaving the Navy where we were actually encouraged to get on Social Security disability insurance as I was leaving the Navy so I was in a classroom full of the only one with a visible injury or is obvious as to why I'm being medically retired and they're all getting medically retired and by Nature getting medically retired from the military Insurance even though every single person in their walk right out of that classroom is perfectly capable of working was so frightening to me that it was that it is so ingrained in our new culture that it said it was actually in the curriculum at a government classroom and in this kind of stuff is cheered on being the sort of hoaxes that we've seen her why did jussie Smollett feel that he had to say that to Maga guys in Chicago what was enough what the underlying psychology behind that was because we change the definition of right and wrong and I and I see a need to get us back to some traditional definitions before we all lose our freaking Minds a very good point I think what you're saying is absolutely correct I think victimhood should be if you are an actual victim me and I feel for you it's terrible but if you're not a victim and you're playing up victim but it's disgusting it's one of the gross things that you see in our culture especially when we're talking about how easy Society is now when you have a person who is affluent and successful and famous like jussie Smollett who does that and you like Jesus Christ man I boarded you missed the point that's why it's so foul for us when we see someone who's just trying to be for their own personal gain their trying to game the system and make it out like victim of the grossest things that you can see in a successful culture and its people out there that wheelie are injured like yourself from combat this people out there that really are sick people out there that are really victimized by violent crime and to fake it it's such a it's such a disgusting insult to people that actually are injured real victims in victimhood culture capable of work yet I'm kind of blind and like I can't see even out of my good eye but I can work I'm not shown that I can work why would I take that but that wouldn't be just so that wouldn't I think I would go against their classical definition of of what is fair and just and yet in our current culture I do I don't believe that anybody would call me after that and I should be called out if I had taken that money I really believe that I do I don't believe that anybody would call me after that and I should be called out if I had taken that money I really believe that just because I was already getting benefits right as a result but</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> yeah we you and I privately had this conversation through text messages about the way reporters are using this moment to criticize Trump with with in Ridiculous Ways and one of them was this questioning of whether or not he should describe these drugs that have some promised which many doctors are describing hydroxychloroquine with the Z Pack and zinc apparently combination that keeps getting brought up and there's a doctor that has been using this to some reported success in New York City but what drives me crazy is that these are rare opportunities that someone has to talk to the president and they're using it to chastise him for bringing up drugs that do show promise and hope he's not telling people to go take it he's not advocating it he's not pretending that he's some sort of the medical professional he's just talking about some things that show Pro in the medical community you know what what is your take on all this cuz this is it's a it's a it's a weird situation that he finds himself in with the Press is very strange and antagonistic position we think we should be worth it mean to be a good American a good citizen the Press believes it is their duty to only be adversarial to to politicians mostly conservative politicians they don't treat them across the same way but educated Sapulpa full context full understanding of what's going on not press briefing room and actually asked legitimate questions that would inform the American public but but they don't they play he's got you again the last questions like what do you want to say to people who are upset with you right now and I think they're failing us miserably and then there's the opportunism that occurs like if you're writing an APA if you're a journalist writing an op-ed what's an opinion journalist especially but you always do that in direct questioning with the president just to try and play this gacha game it's not helpful helpful and it's not informing anybody in the least you know you mentioned that the president talking favorably about the floor clean or hydroxychloroquine and you remember the the couple that ingested that out in Arizona because spayed or something like that might be misspeaking bowl cleaner fish tank cleaner weather in Mass it'll actually work but but to express optimism over it to two after each other in the worst of ways and a new ability to do that I mean this what is with these new tools that people have to social media and through making these viral video clips which is what each reporter is hoping is there going to accomplished by being combative with the president and trying to catch him on something they're hoping that they're going to create this viral video that's going to accelerate their career it's very self-aggrandizing it's and it's disturbing that there's there's not someone who stands out what does the sort of press junkets that doesn't do that actually right about that exact point in my book like this what we've begun to do is reward this sort of overly passionate emotional Behavior so we've replaced sophisticated reasoning with outrage we grew up this way and there's there's like fictional characters like the Jedi hero archetype or Superman or or like or like real characters like Rosa Parks that we actually look up to and we identify and in our in our current outrage my culture like we see somebody who plays the victim and we cheer them on reality what we used to do is he somebody who overcame adversity who was the true hero in the wee cheer them on when we totally reverse that you actually get more points if yours more snarky if you're meaner if you're if you're if you're playing this kind of cheap shot game and like it in my book this example of like these these this group of Veterans Day they were waiting for me I knew something was off because we never wear the gold letters that say veteran on it don't I thought that was strange and it turns out they were just getting their own video camera ready to record and then they start calling me and like just go nuts like they lose their minds talking about Trump in the news play and I kind of engage with them and some funny ways but they were extremely emotional I'm either voice is starting to crack it was about you or to you how could you how could you how could you betray the country by supporting the president of me things like that mostly sloganeering like this call me while walking my boo that the scenario and then they like and then there's this whole deal where I have to get the elevator because that's how I get to the books like I leave my my office on the fourth floor and Cannon I take the elevator down the basement I walk across my route and that you think that you that you have to use as much emotion as possible and it's been express your anger in in the most exceptional of ways otherwise it's not worth listening to but we haven't stopped as a culture and we have to stop rewarding and that's what I thought. Rewarding that kind of behavior actually control good for you but you talked about them and that's what they wanted that means there's so many groups out there that I don't even know if they have an endgame that the endgame seems to just get attention and you know and Shine the Light on these atrocities or whatever whatever they feel like is in Frosty</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> China yeah so I just mentioned that one that story that just came out which is what they actually prevented PPE from being delivered outside of China so together we are our company's 3 and they produce that there should have been exported out they prevented that there was a study that showed that if they had if they had actually been honest and given us through the world three weeks extra notice 95% of the spread could have been contained okay 5 million people all over the world the reason this became so bad in Italy and Iran is because of the belt and Road initiative these are major Hotspots for China's Economic Development and the belt and Road initiative so the World Health Organization better can't even be transmitted human-to-human contact on January 30th World Health Organization said something along the lines of there's no reason to be shutting down travel or limiting travel so they're directly controlled by the Chinese government the World Health Organization it should also be worth noting I forgot the guy's name who but he's from Ethiopia Ethiopia is one of these countries that is huge as a huge investments from the Bell Road initiative until I mean we'd to be calling for a complete complete change out leadership of the WHL yeah he shut his connection off and then he said China doing a great job let's move on and you know like what very weird so deeply corrupt I so deeply and I mean point where there was the progressive left in the Chinese just repeated it latched onto it but this whole notion that it's racist to call the virus the Chinese virus was it was such an utterly absurd thing that we were focused on as a country when it just doesn't matter reading that quite a bit in February so they're doing things like that then they claim that perhaps it was the US Army that had started the virus in Wuhan they haven't let International inspectors go in and investigate the origins of this virus that we can better understand it they said there's going to be there already is quite a few things that were looking at it as what we can do to one rebalance or supply chain but we need a better industrial policy on bring a lot of important manufacturing back home and can be more competitive than that sense is there any evidence that this was a man-made virus you know this is the big conspiracy theory that they would have a level four bioweapons lab in Wuhan viruses like this anyway yeah we just we just don't know the answers and I don't you know especially my position I don't want to I don't want to assume to the need to manufacture things in America and I think both I think he's received skepticism from both the left and the right on that for different reasons mostly come to write because you know we we we have we have really good here very closely to the free trade where where the more free trade the better where where somebody else can make it cheaper than then we should just have them make it all right is comparative advantage and that's true in theory it is true but but we can't ignore the consequences and I think we have ignored those consequences for a little too long like what what happens when you when you close down that factory your t-shirts are cheaper per unit which is the really big deal for the margins but it's like a psychological benefits of these manufacturing jobs as well you're creating something people like that people like to feel like they're producing something and that they have meaningful work that pays pretty decent and so there's consequences and there's consequences to the efficiency big big Dire Straits right now we risk we risk the possibility that we lose energy into between Russia and Saudi Arabia now hopefully I think administration's Melodies and diplomatic pressure and figured that out but no but balance right now maybe yes and maybe we do need to look at changing our supply chains maybe that means some things are just slightly more expensive maybe that's what it means but for for a lot of element for a lot of items we have to be looking at the consequences of allowing us to have things manufactured over there what kind of karma do we take on for when you look at Foxconn those buildings were they made got your iPhone live net surrounding to keep people from jumping off a how many people have to jump before you put Nets up and like what what what has to happen there where you were your your life suck so hard to make an iPhone and how much would it cost to make those here is it worth it for us and you know is there some the real value in that the label used to love to look for made-in-america there that's that's not really that much anymore I think it would be wise for all of us to invest in that ID again in the problem is is like we we hold ourselves to those standards of good labor conditions and good environmental standards and we but we punish ourselves and was out of business completely until we punish ourselves out of business sometimes the energy sector whatever it is because we we we we simultaneously make ourselves less competitive while also forcing our people to compete against people who are who work their employees so hard but they have to build nests around for office they throw themselves off of it one that we just accept because we want an iPhone and I mean apples one of those profitable countries the company's rather the world ever known made is a spectacularly profitable company and it like there's a hole in government policy and and they do but I'd like to do more the reason they don't is because when they put out that job application nobody will show up early is not enough people and so-and-so what the what does that tell you it it tell you that we we're not educating people in the skills that are necessary to engage in these jobs is a lot of technical skills that we are not teaching because education policy Federal Loan program student loans why are we promoting things and Majors that actually get us to a higher-paying job why why should the taxpayer be on the hook for a major that is guaranteed not to pay anything once you graduate like what you going to do with that degree in whatever who knows you're not useful for the economy that that we want and so what kind of incentives need to shift is my is my point to encourage more that so that Apple when they do look at a place to build a new Factory they can be they can be confident that people actually show up to work there</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> quotes out there from media and from from from pundits from Twitter users am I in my my fear that it continues to be said okay you know and it prevents us from having a reasonable debate because we we truly need to have that reasonable debate the other the other thing of frustrates me about these kind of bad faith argument is that the people saying them made the same claims them self like a February 1st Washington Post headline in the coronavirus okay February 1st coronavirus is scary but the flu is deadlier in more widespread day February 3rd Washington Post why we should be wary of an aggressive government response to coronavirus the same papers are now destroying the present all you didn't act early enough you didn't do anything it's if you have the blood blood of people on your hand but like that's amazing who says it's not safe to travel to China so this is falling President Trump's extremely at the time of very bold move to restrict travel from China and of course all of these papers and prominent people are now saying something different I go through a timeline to buy look at because it ended my continue to accuse everybody how this is this is a good one on the same day that that Trump implemented the restriction on travel this was January 27th okay and then January 31st asare the prettiest the 31st the Trump Administration implemented the restriction on travel January 31st and also declared a public health emergency on that same day promoted a bill call Dino bandak you could limit the president's ability to impose travel restrictions that's interesting and then act like this when you remember this too and I pointed this out at the time because you know a lot of people were not talking about coronavirus in February and on February 28th which is a few days before February 28th already been spent by HHS by CDC that needed to be reimbursed so the Trump administration's or even dealing with this matter like a congress we need more money we need more supplemental funding he got slammed cuz this was earlier in the week we actually voted didn't know and I I just want I just want to point these things out because it's important to give each other to Grace to be like hey not everybody knew what was happening it wasn't until early March that it was exploding as a virus Tintin in Tehran and Italy and in South Korea he's things happened and it wasn't clear that there should be massive massive lockdowns play hindsight and enacting a holier-than-thou and point fingers but if it's highly disingenuous and I and I built this whole time light out to show it from grace and and solve these problems together because it will be very easy to blame each other for the deaths of Americans no matter what the decision is it will be easy because the counterfactual is impossible to prove it's so easy that political opportunism is so easy is is what worries me the most and like we have to have this conversation so about reopening society and when to do it and we have to have the conversations about this political opportunism and shaming it and and calling it for what it is and then really being honest with those quotes in the Washington Post a New York Times USA Today and letting people know know we didn't know what this was we didn't see it coming and when it was coming we were real confused as to what the consequence going to be and we're also not getting on his data out of China right China is just a day or not honest about the body count they're not honest about any of it we don't really know what happened over there the version that we're getting is got holes in it it yeah let's talk about that I did find a quote that I told you I had the wrestler victims of Trump's stupidity and narcissism prominent Washington Post this is from a prominent Washington Post columnist I'm not choosing random Twitter users you know New York Times President Trump was so focused on fabricating threats involving Central American Caravan that he was oblivious to the real threats so</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> so maybe discuss is is the balance that that needs to be talked about in this is where I would have taken the conversation from earlier about the media old people please take care of yourself stay home that provide assistance to get you food or do whatever they can to get to you but people that are high they want them to go out and live their lives they don't want the restaurants to shut down the pub to shut down this is a disease that you know it's ravage people of all nationalities and the old age and demographic groups but they're their ideas take care of your health be careful but let's get Society back on its feet again and they're widely criticized by that I would love to hear what you think that's a good strategy or not but there's three different strategies okay and there's a Harvard white paper that that delineates these pretty well I spoke with one of the professors from the center of Ethics that that was an author of this and you can describe these three strategies in the following way jump to the third one the third one would just be surrender okay let it happen will deal with it as we go but we're not keeping anybody at home that's effectively what Sweden is doing the second option would be sort of a mix of the two which I think will end up being the American option or better will should be where we have a defined. Where we remain in place but then we we confront the enemy and like I said we're in a tactical Retreat right now but I need to be prepared to do it Sweden took on the third approach which is like the basically they they think they can deal with it and we're going to see now their cases are jumping up pretty dramatically I don't know how much they'll continue jumping up the swedes are also very good at culturally following the rules Americans don't like a lot of rules I sweeten the swedes will stop at a red light at 2 a.m. cultural differences I think their social cohesion or ability to follow rules I like the Koreans is it different than our culture where we are we are just way more individualistic and we're going to do whatever the hell we want we want to flamethrower in our office organizer flamethrower at our office like don't tell me I can't have it right yeah it's always better lets you want to start a fire without the situation is move to that rather quickly now we need to be careful about how we do it but I'm very very concerned about these indefinite extension of the timeline to stay in place I think I think we have to start having reasonable conversations about the cost of that in the cost a lot more than just dollar sign the cost or hell of a lot more than just people's 401K is tanking the costs are actually people's lives also whether it's mental health or suicides are divorced or Applebee's all these procedures that we're just putting freezer so like and I have a lot of problem with this place is like Houston or hospitals are not overwhelmed 50% capacity prone to this giant City with enormous density the most it's the densest city in the country by far is also the most likely place that a lot of international Travelers were coming in and out of New Orleans will they had Mardi Gras these numbers in the wrong ways and not taking enough into the account into the fact that it we just we have very different lifestyles in different parts of the country and also take into account that we can Target certain Solutions once you slowed the spread by doing what we're doing again I'm not against doing what we're doing I just think we need to stick to the timelines and maybe make those time on sooner than later and then come out and fight what does fighting mean while we're in wait we're basically we're ramping up production of protective gear or ramping up production of ventilators again our system is as amazing we are producing we're going to be do the numbers before or talk about socialized medicine like one of the benefits of our system is we are actually way better prepared than people realize now we have a big lack of PPE there's a lot of reasons for that I can go into one reason is that China was stopping for from 3 a.m. for the rest of the world uses a lot of it in China are preventing those experts who they want before the supplies then they act like the good guy and go around the world giving it out and then trying to ask if we're going to have to really look at the door supply chains in our relationship with China after this but that's one of the reasons we didn't have the proper amount of PPE president is everybody's micromanaging boss and that's just not how our system works nor should it and there has to be some level of accountability of the local and state-level to again I just got the phone with some of the doctors here at the Texas Medical Center and I'm like how are you guys on PPE and they're like we have so much PP what I've noticed and all the finger-pointing and in a lot of it's just political opportunism I don't know if you if you like if you do put these people at school lie detector test I wonder if they really think it would be the president's fault that this happened like I don't I don't think they could pass a lie detector test and I think it's I think it's a lot of political Pediatrics but in any case it's away from the right way to look at power levels like California wants to try a single-payer healthcare system let's see it work in California or smaller say and then let's let's Skate City and then let's go it's it's it's it's a matter of the scale matters to a huge extent and socialism works if you got maybe like 50 or 60 people cuz you can hold each other accountable there's a little bit easier to maintenance when you scale things out of dramatically changes things we have to remember that as it pertains to dealing with the pandemic and dealing with public policy as well into a system where were simultaneously combating the pandemic but also reopening our economy we have to have that in the natural reaction from disingenuous people is well how many lies is it worth to save a job and I'm like okay that's not the right question also misses the point you know we we live in a world where we take risks and then we have to take those risks and then mitigate those risks accordingly and we can better mitigate risk and we better understand what we're dealing with and when we're better prepared and those are the two things we have to do over the next month new beds where they might be needed any more generators anymore PPE so that's preparedness side and on the other side it's just like you know like you'd explain in Sweden with cheap sick and vulnerable people away let's target are our efforts a little bit better listen to him or vertical approach as opposed to horizontal approach that's a terrible way to think about it I mean I I can moralize this situation so I could save 30000 live this year because I'm not going to let anybody drive and I am a better person than you because you have the blood of 30,000 people on your hands cuz you won't people driving yeah that's where it's not at all know you're you're absolutely right and I'm worried about that when we do go back I'm worried about that finger-pointing I really am because I think it's just going to muddy the waters and I'm also worried about it being used as political opportunism</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> remind everybody of this with their start to the drug price discussion that bill that hr3 bill it won't become law because it wouldn't hurt get bought out by the bigger companies that support system works and it's a very dynamic system it's it's it's why we RV by far the number one innovator in the world know what our country innovate like we do I don't do the research like we do if we implemented the price controls that are inherent and medicare-for-all or hr3 there wouldn't be anybody else in the world doing what we do should we have Medicare for all doesn't coronavirus prove that everybody should have free healthcare and again what I would have to remind everybody is is that if we had medicare-for-all what we're basically talking about our price controls because Medicare already pays below average payment for for anything before whatever service were over for whatever doctor visit 60 70% on the dollar right now what was the Medicare senior program at 65 and make sure that their basic needs are covered in terms of sickness illness injury and such and we could argue that we could we could even debate the merits of Medicare on its face would be available for everybody if Medicare for all was available for everybody what you're saying is it was essentially you you would fix prices on on everything in terms of medical treatments and and that would be a problem because of what will soap Sherman said that your podcast could could only take $100 for at and I was just the price fixed for now on what incentive would you have to really expand your audience what would you have to keep going or expand the business you wouldn't be able to it's similar under any industry it wants you to fix that price on you're going to reduce the supply that goes in I can only get $100 for add the reason why you would say that the sting shouldn't cost too much for someone who's injured or sick it's cuz we want to take care of each other as a community and the ideas that Health Care should be something that we we provide so many services to people that we we we are united right the United States of America we're supposed to be a gigantic community and one of the great things that we could do for each other is to make sure that if someone's sick or injured and something's wrong that we can take care of that like everybody do their share and we would like everybody to chip in so that this is possible but there's a big difference between that and fixing the price on an ad no but not economically there's no difference morally there is write instead of just an economic issue the reason I don't describe is it it's not in your right it is both a moral and a Mexican guy that is fundamentally true it is fundamentally another country we have overwhelmingly per capita more ICU beds in this country than any other Western Country overwhelmingly per capita we have more ventilator than any of these other people were all girl freaking out right now and in our ICU beds on a per-capita basis our system has way way more than the UK than Italy in Spain to Germany all of them like like orders of magnitude for also we're the ones who Innovative in the vast majority of research and development new drugs that come out that comes from this country so these are these are facts that we can escape if we do price controls and medicare-for-all is fundamentally a system of price controls if we do that economically speaking we absolutely will reduce Supply we still want to help people to do that good parts of our healthcare system which is quality and Innovation if we undercut those things were the last country doing this for the last country in the world truly doing Innovation either the world is left out the drive is there a way to do both is there a way to provide Healthcare to everyone but also encourage this Innovation and current profit so you encourage these companies to do all these great things you're describing and and and May in this incredibly high level of healthcare that we have right now that that's certainly the goal right in and that that should be the goal in this is why I think there's there's got to be room for compromise on the health-care debate because you can't compromise with the other party if the girls aren't the same difficult it is to get to that point while also ensuring that we maintain quality and Innovation so well I'm working on personally is is the primary care side of things because her primary care doctor is your bet your first point of contact in healthcare and the system that I think works best for that has direct Primary Care subscription fee of about $75 a month and they have full access to you so it's like less than a cell phone bill this already exists this model is prevalent it's growing I would like to see a girl much faster to how do you do that when we can't subsidize lower-income people in order to do that how we do that is very complicated what are healthcare costs like like you and me we can still afford that just like we afford any other monthly cost and you have access to preventive medicine you have access to telemedicine you actually have a doctor-patient relationship that makes it a lot easier to start solving the rest of the problem making our insurance Market more competitive companies that came out to be a lot cheaper than we originally thought it would in the early 2000s went when this thing was created this was a republican plan because Foundation that I think we have to adhere to and the other thing I pushed back on a little bit is is the healthcare is a right statement and I push back against that obligation to serve you not exactly no I mean wait wait we have public services that I would distinguish those public services from something like Direct Care and it doesn't change the mission of the military right thing away from them but these nonrival economics term for the sort of non rival attribute of these things it is different right because it's only a select number of doctors and we were burned out more price controls reduce supply and supply reductions in other countries girls don't get the same amount of money they're not going to rest in that extra I see you better not going to buy those extra ventilator they're not going to hire those other doctors eye doctor doesn't want to be a doctor because they don't make them out of money that they thought they would make their doing extra work because there's more people who now have access to them but there's less of them so wait lines are huge and they're seeing multiple more patients a day doctor burnout increases quite a bit quick answers to why why why that happens but that's our human rights issue it did we we kind of moved around with that The Vig either different than the fire department or the police department or well it's not a right either actually those but the fire department's not necessarily A a right as we would be the same if it's provided for everyone from a practical standpoint just because it's much easier again you cannot hundred thousand people more to your city and the fire department would have marginally more more work to do you know compared to like a doctor for instance it does that make sense like you just it doesn't that that nonrival attributes matter it matters quite a bit so what you're saying is because competition is necessary with medical Innovation and also like doctors profit off of being exceptional so you you they have incentive to be an exceptional no know what I'm saying is if you have if you have 10 doctors that's better serving the community every time that doctor is serving somebody that means somebody else can't see them signal that we need more doctors they're understaffed would be yes but I'm saying that's how it's different from a fire department which is sort of lying and wait for a fire to occur it would be a signal for there to be more doctors which is why the free-market price price points are so important because the only way to signal that is to actually there that demand raises prices when the government tries to do that is a socialist that they would say never works never ever work the Government Camp Spell omniscient as to know every single price signal and and anticipate every single piece of demand and production that is therefore required until they know it's not just health care that this is a problem it's every aspect of society so if I can go back to what you were saying earlier you said hey let's make the the government take care of everything was take money from the wealthy people and pour it into the government that the government will then have sources take care of these issues and you you're just looking at the first step of the problem you're not looking at the secondary or tertiary once you do Implement that first step is that we're saying hundred percent what I'm saying socialism doesn't believe in incentive doesn't believe that we need incentive to do things there's there's there's this utopian believe from the hardcore of philanthropic manner no matter what right now maybe for a few people if you altruistic people would be the ones you know doing all the work while everybody else is like pretending to work which isn't happening the Soviet Union you pretend to pay us we'll pretend to work right that was the saying from the Soviet Union these policies then we're not thinking through them correctly and I understand a lot of democratic socialism and I'm like yeah but it but it has very socialistic Tendencies effects of removing human incentive of forcing somebody's services and because you're calling it a right which means that you now have a right to somebody else's services I've been proven not to work and I and I and I think we and I think we have to understand that as we try to move towards the mutual goal of getting everybody access to healthcare department is in the fire department in a lot of ways a socialist Institution specific emergency service as a as a public good they come in and help you there's not a financial incentive for them to do so right but I've been a practical level on a practical level though imagine the scaling that has to occur if you're if you're doing that with medic with medical care they were talking about over what you're talking about socialism overall not just overall not just involving medicine talking about socialism in general and I'm saying isn't the fire department and example of socialism that works example of socialism and the people have these as a basic part of our society and our civilization this is an important discussion to have because oftentimes even Democrats aren't really talking about socialism doesn't call it socialism about Democratic socialism and you make some very clear distinctions between the two of them which I think you could apply to things like the fire department or the police department policies because he does talk about putting government control on corporate boards Elizabeth Warren talk about the same things now we really are talk about nationalizing thanks Industries on wage controls that you really are talking about more of an actual socialism what is a public good we've never in our economics we've never defined these things as socialist institutions and social institution effectively means your production and you're you're forcing everybody into a centralized planning State you're you're you're telling people what they will learn and what you will pay them how much they can sell the fire department is really not that again that is better than a public service it has a defined and has a defined budget of the definer roll beaches with Piers ago we're probably more of a free-market than we do in many ways when we look at their regulatory standards are quite liberal when we look at the corporate tax rate as it's very low they don't have a minimum wage and in many cases until they're not what they do have is a very Jen welfare state and and that's a different than again and even that is different than socialism as a giant welfare state now I'm still against that many ways I think there's consequences to that giant welfare state that that they now have to suffer with as a result and if you've noticed India used to be much more deeply socialist countries on the lot of them have just maintained their big welfare states which they are having trouble paying for just like we're having trouble paying for our big welfare state which is mostly based in Social Security Medicaid and Medicare when you say public good right this is what you feel that the fire department is it's a public good right what do you think that this is possible to implement something like that with in regards to Medical Care the discussion definition straight we're just saying okay we just want another public good in a more accurate way of describing it I think healthcare 30-something trillion dollars never over 10 years so about about three and a half trillion per year so that's basically doubling our budget just every year that's in addition to what we already spent additional federal spending some some some people try to massage those numbers and say all but that's actually cheaper than what we have now if you had it all together that is false that is that is completely false and that's not a controversial study everybody basically agrees Elizabeth Warren's plan was 50 something trillion dollars that's adding what we already spend to the new spending I would have to occur so what does that mean in practice it means doubling or tripling your taxes okay let's say they actually want to do that then you have the second and third order consequences which is okay what are you getting for this what is this new Utopia that we really live in where Healthcare is free and then I go back to okay in order to meet that price point of the the three and a half trillion a year that's that's by the way assuming that we continue using Medicare prices which is what all the plans do assumed by the way we're doing that were drastically cutting prices that we pay doctors and hospitals if we do that we drastically cut our supply of doctors and hospitals and we and we and we cut off and choke off the Innovative capacity that we do have so we're losing those quality the quality point it is too costly until rather do is actually Target the source of the problem make it easier to get insurance cuz right now I mean it's for so many Americans that insurance is just too expensive if you have it through your employer it's usually pretty good people to be happy with that but for the most part it's too expensive which is why I go back to my direct Primary Care idea because once you hit once you saw the primary care issue you mix all the insurance much easier you can do it then you can still protect people we like things like Iris pools at the state level or reinsurance programs you can make this you can continue to make improvements to the system that make it affordable for people people a fax just the thing weather in yours my question in the whole thing like Insurance still have to pay for it then it's too you're still paying someone still paying for all this health care if the insurance companies are making any profit cuz they're paying for all the healthcare then what happens then do we fund the insurance companies how does all this stuff get even doubt people can afford Healthcare so we get insurance insurance takes care of healthcare how did the insurance companies make any money then just like anybody else but they're also that they're there also what we found is especially with our experiments with Medicare insurance companies against each other and they lower cost I'm one side is driving up costs you know because the doctor wants to keep doing more tests or whatever it is or where patient wants to do more things the insurance company's job is just hold on a second why are you doing this what what is the reason for this was the outcome that we expect from this so that naturally drives that's natural assuming that the government will somehow be better if that then insurance company insurance companies are great that all everybody doesn't seem to like them but I also don't want the government doing it I don't want to be in a case like in Great Britain where where the government will say you know what your grandad's not on the ventilator anymore we're done with that or your baby can't get that care these stories and we don't have that issue in America certain things they might but they still good but the car still happens the hospital has to eat that care a lot and there's there's different funding mechanisms that reimburse them but no that doesn't that's not the way it happens over there any more there's no choice but that's that that is that is the decision and then that's what they have to deal with and so it's it is different but don't they have some private healthcare over there as well I think it might have elements of it but but but not for basic care I said you can eat for four other kinds of healthcare that aren't but not for basic care I said you can eat for four other kinds of healthcare that aren't really out</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> it worries me a great deal with weekly changed a few definitions like what it means to be a victim I think we change that definition overwhelmingly and we change the definition of justice also an injustice and what an injustice actually is we forgetting how to do we forgotten how to distinguish between discrimination and disparities like just because you don't have the same thing occurred there the real problem and it's it's made to be very difficult as it may debate with my colleagues the Democratic party is very difficult because every disparity is assumed to be originating from some kind of Injustice you know every time somebody is welder than somebody else the Assumption nowadays is that will it still be gotten money and that there's some kind of Injustice that occurred there is no renegotiating through this thing it was actually looking pretty good Nancy Pelosi comes then says he'll no blowing up the whole thing and we're going to protect workers and damn you know not these damn corporations okay so basically the same bill anyway that's a long story operation attached to it and we forgotten how to ask ourselves why is that did they do something evil what would it what exactly is evil about these entities you know that they employ lots of people who create lots of wealth and in this particular case or not do anything wrong worries me a great deal it worries me a great deal that's what I think that's what leads to be sort of topics of socialism is one of the bad aspects of the ideals of socialism is this inclination to think that when there is an inequality that than inequality is because of either corrupt corruption or greed there's also in equality of effort people do not put in the same effort and when you put in more effort you're more focused more discipline do more work you should be rewarded and there's people that don't like that idea they don't like that idea cuz they're f****** lazy and they're weak and that's a fact and there's people in this world that are weak and there's it's it's a unpopular thing to say because we want to say that no there there economically disenfranchised and there was the some people are yes some people are and there's also some people that work like a motherfuker and those people get by and they get ahead and those people should be rewarded for their effort one of the problems that I have with people that have spouse socialist ideals is that they don't want this competition aspect of our culture and our society to exist where you putting more work you get more reward that's my whole life that is my whole life I mean that did every everything that I've ever done I realized oh all you have to do is work harder than everybody else do is put in more time all you have to do is be more obsessed more focused and you can get by you can get ahead the people that don't like that or the people that don't like competition that they don't understand it it makes you feel bad when you lose everyone should get a trophy every once you get a participation trophy that is a giant problem with our culture and this inequality yeah there is income inequality some of it is corruption some of it is bad some of it is in equality of effort and that needs to be addressed as well and it's not like you can of his blanket thing that all the people that run corporations are greedy and all the money that they have acquired is because of ill-gotten gains it's just not true it's not true and it's it's anti-American frankly first one's personal responsibility one of the detail on that has mental toughness whatever the whole book about so it's important you said it exactly how I described it when I get speeches on this which is we need mental toughness because otherwise how do we survive in a free Society where we have to compete cuz the only alternative to a bunch of people is that we do live in a society where competition Society can't function very well actually do anything and you have to be mentally tough to deal with that and I think the American Spirit named Eric our history as a culture is a really really tough bunch of people to remind people of that celebrate you for it people tell their victim of stories are cheered but where's the part where you overcame it I thought that was the story were supposed to cheer competition with cruelty and I think that's that's foolish as well and yeah it feels bad to lose but that's just because it feels great to win there's it's a it's a Pecan Valley thing and you have to understand that and look every competition that I've ever had any anything that we have ever competed in Lost has old me beyond measure it is what gets you by it's what makes you better one of the reasons why I understand this is because of martial arts in martial arts you have to train with the best people you can and it's it's f****** sucks you get your ass kicked it's part of the but that's what makes you better you need those people you love those people they become your brother's is very very very important the bonds that are formed in Jiu-Jitsu gyms and kickboxing gyms and martial arts gyms with the people you train them mini train with is an intensity to those Bond that's almost Indescribable to anybody that hasn't experienced it I mean I'm sure it's not as tight as people have gone through combat together but there's something there's something in those people they they fuel you they help you and they help you by trying to kick your ass they help you by trying to be better than you they help you by trying to be the man that they want to be the best they can be and you think about those motherfuker you go to the gym you go goddamnit Mike is here and you get fired up for that person that you know is going to kick your ass and they provide you with fuel people that are better than you provide you with fuel competition provide you with fuel it doesn't mean you have to be mean it doesn't mean it's cruel it doesn't mean it's insensitive it doesn't mean it doesn't mean that it just means that competition is good competition is good for you it's good it shows you your better abilities it shows you delete that you you can aspire to Greatness you can Inspire to be better than you are you can do this and you can do this by looking at people who also do it they are your fuel inspiration is fuel nobody gets inspired by jussie Smollett putting a f****** fake noose around his neck and walking into a hotel still holding a Subway sandwich nobody's inspired by that maybe your Inspire to never be that guy and that but it's a week inspiration you're inspired by greatness you're inspired by great people stories does autobiographies in documentaries and stories of them putting in that work anyway. That's why there's so many people that you know they're their Instagram existence is essentially just all they doing is just providing inspiration to people like David Goggins that f****** got everyday means that guy's fueling millions of people just by being a badass just doing just life is hard motherfuker stay hard and just getting out and running everyday just by doing that I don't know him some help him who is who's filming these he's got a lot of money I mean he sold the s*** out of that book so it makes it fantastic book and I can't recommend it enough and you can't hurt me it's called and the audio version is even better because the audio version actually get somebody else to read it but then he comes in between and discusses each and every chapter so it's like the audiobook and a podcast together you know he he lives in incredible life and he's that guy is an amazing source of fuel for people but isn't amazing source of fuel because of his own competition with himself and he's a guy that talked really openly about being weak at certain points in his life and being fat lazy and that he got through that isn't had that he wasn't born this f****** Warrior that came out of the womb running a hundred miles from being a slob and he's real open about and he's even open about his own weakness currently he's like sometimes I stare at my f****** shoes for 1/2 hour run my shitt I don't want to do this but they don't go out and do it and while he's doing it he'll yell you know that people like that are fuel and there's certain people that don't like people like that cuz they make them feel bad they look at themselves to go God damn it I don't work as hard as that guy I don't have that kind of mental toughness and then the needs to try to find something wrong with it but it's it's because they're not willing to look at themselves objectively they're not willing God damn it I don't work as hard as that guy I don't have that kind of mental toughness and then the needs to try to find something wrong with it but it's it's because they're they're not willing to look at themselves objectively they're not willing to try to be the best person that they can be</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> concerns I think classical liberals and it is that how you would describe yourself I don't know what all of us political world Joe Rogan's political leanings are like the great mystery I just don't think it's a good idea to take someone who's struggling with dementia and put them in one of the most stressful positions the world has ever known that's what I'm saying is not an endorsement of trump is it is a nice saying you shouldn't have a man who's clearly clearly in the throes of dementia I mean there's I'm not a doctor but when you can't form sentences in public and you forget what you're talkin about and you you're you wander off into these conversations if you're not can pot and you're not high if you're not pills like what's going on well there's cognitive decline he's an older man that has mental issues and you know not to be cruel to him he's he's suffering medically this is what is the real issue and the Democrats want to sweep that under the rug and Trump is already too and Emma parties already dismissing him I mean that there is a recent thing that Kyle kulinski posted a video on his Twitter talking about this is what happened when don't discuss the elephant in the room and Trump saying used to do it during a press conference and they asked him a question was something to Biden Rodeo I didn't write that he's like that's a democratic operative he didn't read it he probably doesn't even know what's going on right now and he's going to he's going to continue to do that and it's it's such a vulnerable point and I I don't know why the Democrats thought it would be a good idea to take someone who's clearly got a problem and this is what do you mean the guy we've all seen it it's not normal it's not normal to forget like when he's talking about the Creator and he literally loses what he saying he's like do you know the thing struggling the guy struggling he's tired this is extremely stressful process to run for president and the idea that he's going to be able to get through this and be okay on the other side to run the country for for potentially 8 years his crazy looking at the coronavirus in particular in the handling of it and this is obviously the subject of hot debate continue in and politicians including Pelosi who continue to repeat that Trump has the deaths of thousands on his hands on my I think that's a horrible horrible overstatement I mean to say the least it's just fundamentally not true just recently acknowledged that he now agrees with Trump's decision to close down travel from China in January and a podcast no I don't know where I go to a timeline of what actually happened right like with what's actually look into this debate and in an objective way of who knew what and wet because you can criticize people for sure and what we all knew at certain times saying that was repeating Chinese claims in mid-January that this virus couldn't even be transmitted in human-to-human contact you know and Trump was ripped apart for that Biden ripped him apart for that by a couple weeks ago those are those are certainly issues and I need to go into it but it's that can talk I mean anyone who's not in in severe cognitive decline mean pick a person should I vote for Hillary vote for him literally the poor guy shouldn't be in the position he's in I don't understand why they're doing that I mean anyone else could have been Tulsi gabbard Amy Klobuchar Pete buttigieg pick a person they all would have been a better choice and this is crazy and I don't know what their strategy is I don't know why they decided to do this it makes no sense to me it's very very confusing I mean anyone else could have been Tulsi gabbard Amy Klobuchar Pete buttigieg pick a person they all would have been a better choice than this is crazy and I don't know what their strategy is I don't know why they decided to do this it makes no sense to me it's very very confusing</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> true it's true why should I should Joy have boundary shouldn't and we have this is what I'm really into I'm really into like people having a big stake in community and I think when you look out for other people that's when you have the biggest steak in community and I think that's one of the things were missing today we're missing week and we can do it around neighborhoods like we're talking about like you know your neighbors it's really nice but I think we could do it in the expanse of way as long as we didn't give in to the temptation to be shity two people that we don't know and I treat everybody is if we're all a part of a community I think that can be done and I think the best way to sort of enhance that kind of thinking is to make decisions that are for the downtrodden make decisions that are for the working class in the people to struggling and people they're just trying to put food on the table and keep a home heated that everyone that's in that experience there because they're lazy or because don't work hard or because they think that they just said but it is but it's it's all so that they don't know they have an experience with those people experience and if they think about every person alive you there's not much difference this is our unsurmountable positive thinking broke one of the problems that we all have our perception really look at things people also deserve attention exactly they need a hug or just so scared will Java raising their kids to the point of broken cats and those kids need to find some way back to the garden and that's the reality of scale that the factors 350 million people just in America is that the real numbers at North America the right way like you have to have no room for douchebaggery no room for density possible level of guidance and of understanding of the consequences of not behaving that way and the benefits of behaving like somehow or another it's a weakness if your if you show if you show any sort of sympathy or Compassion or or try to have some understanding from people are downtrodden or poor people look at you like you're weak but now you're looking at the wrong way you're looking at you feel uncomfortable about it because it makes you feel weird because it's too many variables and it'd be better if you just nailed down to 1 or 0 is a lazy or the good hard-working people it's a good hard-working people who figured out the delays they don't it's not how many of us the idea that like no one should get help that's so crazy I was on welfare when I was a kid it's important it's important for people to keep them fed like gives people a chance like that doesn't mean that people make sure that the government has our confidence we feel like we can throw them our money they're going to do the right thing with it and we're going to help communities where to help that's what everybody's worried about for good reason it's just who the f*** knows who's taking your money they don't give you an accounting cheat they don't show you what they're spending on you just keep it up and like all these are the people that are taking care of us and then you can also take care of yourself and each other and measure neighbors and recognize your community and an kind of bill from the ground-up know who your your local representatives are you know for fucksake like your kids and their schools in like all that stuff like that is a very powerful tool and even I mean those are official titles and official designations and all that stuff is awesome to but it's also just know who the f*** is around you and liking in and be nice to each other and figure it out together we're all acting like every buddy is not going to help you and everybody's not going to understand you and then that one that gets fed to a scale of this impossible number 350 billion people 350 million people doesn't make sense to us it's so hard for us to ever understand what it's like trying to like do what's best for 350 million people and if there's ever a conspiracy to keep people stupid that's a conspiracy make that seem like it's normal make that seem like a month everybody shouldn't you really can affect things and you really should pay attention is to make life better for everybody when you're really really really really rich let's say You're really really really really really rich what if you just really really really real you are contributing in a dynamic way to A system that helped you get really really really really rich see The Balancing Act is not wanting to get to a place where you stifle people's need to do well because they need to have some sort of motivation some people do you want me to have motivation stop this idea they're going to come steal your money so I can know what you are going to help you're going to have to steal any money you're going to help people that can't help themselves but there's people you might have got lucky might have got a good parents and in a good situation good neighborhood good school you did well when you get Boston words like socialism and libertarianism and all these different f****** labels that carry all this weight behind them and we just say like what's your intentions is your intentions to make the community a better place for everybody and make people happy make sure we will have food and make sure people are loved and make sure people are in a wart that's what we should do as a community that's the thing that's the thing these f****** labels with his liberal Republican you f****** cook you know you goddamn hippie all these different labels of people is so easy to dismiss people with these labels and they have such an agenda plays on that part of the human psyche that wants to be a part of a team that attack opposing ideas and it becomes a f****** tribal thing it's so hard to sort out what's right and what's wrong you know but I think we're in a weird space where no one at the wheel I think that's the first time there's no the government doesn't have a hold of Wheels mastery this thing is you know you said the word love and like music and art and you know things that are cohesive in communal environments and helping people come together like in terms of like feeling like like what what can I contribute like how can I help because this feels like an epidemic this this disbandment you know amongst us and all the sphere everybody so scared I am in a in and out of it I go in and out of my fear is fleeting you know it it's things that are a little superficial at times but at the end of the day like this the love thing that the energy that you could make fun of me I don't give a f*** you know like the fact is like we all need it you know will want it and we all deserve it so what what are going to do with that you know like we can sit here and dissect politics and agendas and this guy this guy and socialism all his stuff but we all need to feel that thing and it is love and is very very very powerful and it comes in many forms and it has you know different hats and I think that right now like like I'm sure that you feel it at a show right when you play music for people you know I'm sure you feel it all the time with your podcasting with your shows and with the Outreach that you have and you don't forgive me I don't want to assume you know it and I feel it it in all the varying degrees of the shows that I play and things in like at the end of the day this stuff it like where we're at is a scary place but there's like this thing is just like kind of one thing and it's it is the love thing and that has like a bunch of different adjectives around it and verbs that are like recognizing each other and seeing each other and saying hey we're different but we're the same and we're okay like let's keep moving you know the thing that saves me from all this like deep depths of fear is that. There's really nothing else I have to say like cuz it's a weird that we're living in but that's the thing that's it it is weird world and people can tip left or right or people tip good or bad one way or another depending upon how you approach them sure and this is a thing that a lot of us get wrong you run into someone there a dick your dick back and turns into a fight you like the other guy was a f****** dick yes but sometimes when some was a dick and you're not a dick they stop being a dick that's right we didn't like we used to defuse a situation where energy gets heated and some reason I don't know I don't know if I should retell the story but like you know you its accountability to like you know when you mess up okay to be wrong I smoking made a mistake I'm so sorry we're really helps your education as a person as a as a girlfriend or boyfriend a lover a father or Son you learn when you fuk up you learn you learn like God damn I was wrong I guess that's a valuable lesson cuz it's humiliating there's some when you're hanging onto righteousness like this like and ability to say that you were wrong that is a f****** burden it's not just a burden it's so foolish Pursuit like you should relish every opportunity to apologize and say you're wrong as a showing of strength does if you think you're strong you think you're strong and you know you're wrong and you don't tell the truth will then you are a fool you're you're missing out on an opportunity for you to be strong show the strong the show that you made a mistake I've made a lot of mistakes I make them all the time I'm a f****** dummy all right I do my best but but there's a lot of mistakes you talk to me about it and you want to have a discussion about it I'm not one of those people that I don't think there's any value in pretending you didn't make a mistake I think there's a real send it. The rules were written were written by people who really hadn't had a good grass for the territory yet they didn't really understand what they're saying they should have taught people that school they should have taught people like that in junior high school high school for sure it should have said your your failures those feelings that you feel like they teach about history and math know how your failures are a very valuable fuel you have that feeling you get when a girl dumps you what a feeling that when you crash your car or the feeling that you get when you f****** ruin something you say something wrong when something comes out of your mouth when you anything you did wrong you flunk out of a class that negative feeling is a boost to the next orbit it supposed to blast you into the next level of understanding what you were doing wrong and how to improve in your life and how to go forward with better habits and if you don't experience that pain that feeling that embarrassment then you don't really know how valuable it is to stay on your grind and people say it all the time it resumes of people that stay on your grind like yeah but it's not okay to be human speaking we can't just be like accountable and strong at the same time meaning is that why the like monkey brain enough that's like you have to be all that s*** like ancient instinct when they would it look if we barely had enough food to keep our babies alive and our friends alive and our parents alive barely had enough food we saw someone slacking holyshit do you want to f****** kill them if you saw them someone that was sneaking food taking too much food I saw someone that wasn't putting in their work and you were just slightly shy of being comfortable and you knew this f****** lazy motherfuker they just did their work we would all be fine but they don't do it we do they dated claim their foot hurt or they claimed it back hurts they go back to the cave nobody wants to kill him that's what the f*** that's for it's a resource balance relationships like that against like welfare people that need exactly exactly attaching ultimatums or ultimate rather like this is the ultimate truth to any sort of circumstance in a general sense like to pretend that f****** Let's Pretend Yuba City of x amount of people you have a million people that are on some sort of assistance with his food stamps or welfare or whatever the pretend they're all one saying is crazy to pretend it's all one story is crazy one set of circumstances once that's not that's not the question should be like there's no billionaires or sign up for food stamps right do millionaires they're trying to get welfare money right it's only when you're desperate so the question is like how do we engineer Society so that even the most desperate people never hit that spot never hit a spot where they need assistance the most desperate people are always taken care of but they don't have to worry about it and then what motivation is is just following your dreams what you enjoy doing whether it's nothing like playing music or writing books or whatever it is whatever it is finding that thing but that that motivation for doing that thing should be above all above the idea that you have to survive by doing some shity job to make a living to pay for your bills and just robbed you of your your your time and resources it should be like a f*** face recognize that people have a lot of resources need a job will give you the money you don't need a job but understand this m*********** you give it a gift you give it to give the Beethoven ever had Hendrix never had nobody had it you got you got money enough to live no go but understand you got lucky live 80 years everything over there tomorrow to look at the way we distribute money as being like we think about it right now as being this is the way we've always we just have to look at the way we distribute money as being like we think about it right now as being this is the way we've always done it this way we're going to do it but money didn't even exist</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> who led back to where did music come from you know sometimes I wonder if like the people that came up with these things and obviously you can go to school and learn a trade or you know become a master of your craft for engineering but like sometimes I wonder if it's just like some weird other dimensional source that comes out of nowhere I think we should think of ideas as a life on this trying to propagate cuz everything that you see came from an idea everything every invention ever eat everything every song that you've ever written and sang every book it's ever been all that Stan every book ever written came from an idea and then boom it's a real thing like imagine if ideas because we don't know where they're coming from something's giving you a yes like a chant like it was a Channel of sorts that creates things has a very narrative feel like it's coming out of nowhere like I just have to be there to get it you know if you spend a lot of time on it and you're working at it and you're passionate about and you're focused it's it's almost like a music even if it's not real men still real cuz it's it's there's an accuracy to the like if you pretended there was some God that was bestowing upon you these Amazing Ideas if you focused on it and if you eat you let the correct life and live the right path then it would give you these gifts if you focused on your art form and that that would be like if someone told you that there was a God doing out or creativity and you don't know where it came from and idea I will come to you I think it's equal not equal parts but it's you know when you put in the effort to like keep the muscle Flex like the creative one where you're writing regularly or you're practicing regularly and then you also kind of let it you know sort of come in its live podcast man Theory and he said it was almost like he was I don't know why this was what he said but he was a gingerbread man and there was a big hole in the top of his head and there was all this s*** falling into this hole from somewhere and every once in a while about 10% of it with light lead us the rim inside of the gingerbread jar and that was him and the rest was other stuff Morty Rick and Morty so much if you do live and then you put all that together and you know we were talked about the war of Art also about like I think everything is a weird thing that we call that you know we call procrastination and he calls it resistance in the book it's really interesting because you realize like what is is weird thing the tries to keep people from being their basket stuff there's like a weird confusion and stress about it that keeps you from focusing on what you really need to do to be a true professional and he's related out of the book in a way that makes you go like 40 years old figured out what he'd been doing wrong changed his Direction and then became like super successful as a writer really respected as a writer and this book is one of the most interesting things because you know like his history that he kind of figured out how to get out of his own way out and put in the work to grow and evolve Kohl's of like a habitat you know what I'm going to do this I'm going to procrastinate in this it's a powerful force you know and then that can grow into so many things you know your self-doubt and now I'm not ready I can't do that I'm not ready yet can't play that show or whatever you know example but has a wrestling match wrestling match between like creating stuff and and being disciplined putting in a lot of lot of work or slacking off and feeling like oh my God I got to get back to work again and then being really excited to work hard and get going again and some people fall too far into one way or the other and there's like a weird balance in there that you don't have to be scared Melody is a big part of of you know giving an honest thing to a crowd when you're playing music or comedy you know I think that sorry I feel like I'm talking too much. listen to in a knock against Conservatory students and things like that but I found that people that are really really smart in the musical education element and and you know again I got a lot of friends and I hope I'm not stepping on any toes but it's almost like harder for them to Vibe out because they're so smart and they're they're almost mathematical with their playing where is like Gary like let's just f****** Raw let's hang out and like find the thing where I think sometimes I felt like when I played with people that I know I'm going to get so much s*** for this I'm so I'm like kind of embarrassing I know the map frontwards and backwards but if you can't feel it when you're playing live and playing with other people then there's a huge missing element that's what I want to say I am not I don't want to but I think that you almost have more of an obstacle when you are you have that kind of intelligence with music because it's upstairs go to say but I kind of simplified like this I think of it like a radio like back in the day when you tune a radio he try and dialing whatever station and you get that Clear Channel sometimes you have to move yourself sometimes you have to just like I'm in that place to receive that inspiration for that that thought or or that Melody whatever that is I'm not Cloud myself with doubt or this isn't that what this person's doing or whatever I'm just I'm here in this with everybody but I'm like I I'm going to dial this until the noise goes away a little bit louder that clears thing and whatever you were talking about with the gingerbread thing are so consumed with giving what they know there their they're not taking the time to sit back and listen like just shut the fuk up for a minute and listen to this beautiful inspiration that comes out of nowhere just like listen to yourself when you show up to a place gives you everything that they know is it where the collective here or you need to like to now and like look at things from a don't get to like the way you're describing your ability shut the f****** and look at the world and draw inspiration for the world is that something that came to you in time or is it something that you always kind of intuitively knew I just I think it goes back to like sitting around smoking weed with my friends and just like not getting caught up with the b******* best type of an artist to be this is like just who listen to my so who am I listen to myself I feel like listening to the sounds</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Unifour example and this is something I think would be kind of interesting to talk about everybody is losing their mind at the moment in the space that you and I sort of Cohen habit of ideas and trying to figure out how do we remain saying and plugged in and open-hearted and open to new things but also rigorous and fair all of these weird pressures of the ideas behind the intellectual dark web this this concept of having a bunch of people that have different ideologies but yet she common theme of wanting to have real honest communication and honest conversations and try to figure out instead of looking at things from an ideological perspective look at things from an honest objective Point end in try to see the way other people because it wouldn't hearted man. Not trying to destroy each other and effectively trying to become the adults in the room as we watch the kids run right right and not always achieving then because I refuse to actually say what it was or who was there's a lot of pressure to codify if I knew that if I codified it it would. You have one but if I don't get one you have what are the clubhouse we just don't tell the members where it is because the IDW that doesn't mention me on my ass yeah yeah I think it's pressure you know and I think I want two things that we're all recognizing from whether it's the internet and the or just celebrity in general which I think it's part of the culprit is especially if you're reading comment and articles written about you which I do not recommend if you are doing that don't do that if you're doing that you are subject to a massive amount of pressure it's a lot of pressure and sometimes people they applied sometimes that pressure can help you like if it's a good friend or someone who you trust and it's done with intellectual honesty and they just really really think that there is maybe a flaw in your thinking or maybe this could help you or maybe this is an issue and then you realize that and yourself correct that's great but there's a lot of people that are bending to the will of the masses and they also are responding to the pressure of the master I don't know is whether I recently read my comments is because I want to know what Russians think you listen to me Joe here we go let's go down the rabbit hole together for sure and we went we talked about this recently let me just say this before you go in that we knew something was going on years ago I used to have a message board and on my message board on my website it became problematic for legal reasons we were putting a bunch of illegal s*** up there and I was kind of responsible for them to issue came up earlier how many coming to get in real trouble we had an influx and by an influx I mean thousands and thousands of Russian emails signing up for my message board I mean thousands with really similar email address right and they would post and pretend they're from f****** Cleveland or post and be mad that we don't have enough Nazis on or whatever the f*** it would be you know it would just be but we just same thing that the IRA was do internet research agency was doing with Facebook and Google and we were seeing this like 4 or 5 years ago that this stuff was kind of happening where they were recognizing that the disease large portals of discussion and so they're trying to manipulate the discussion and turn certain discussions toxic and certain and you know and come up with Preposterous conspiracy theories and attack people for nonsensical reasons will this is the thing I keep seeing the same message modified a hundred different ways for a bunch of accounts that have suspicious similarity not one of these accounts usually is followed by anyone I care about and then they have a few high-value accounts with blurry photographs of a person that like I think somebody's like putting real money into that account to create a fake person which is dog doggedly follows you and is constantly trying to talk to you in your ear that account but how do you know that that's what that is and how do you know it's not just some personal time get to any of it really is really interested in Eric Weinstein was a couple times I've tried to like talk to the person it's nothing vanishes like you're so disgusting would never talk to you goodbye on the other hand there was this huge number of jokes about Ben Shapiro and a booster seat that were also play different versions of the Joker and all of the accounts were like a strikingly similar I was thinking I could imagine a little bit of this but it's way too many and this is part of what I believe I believe that we are in a new world in which a lot of the Grassroots stuff is is AstroTurf and if you start to listen to it you start to get pushed I start to watch certain tactics I make models of the tactic you like one of the tactics is Tosh Eric I once thought that you had a lot of integrity and now I know that X know if you don't if you don't address this situation I'm done following you goodbye but I believe that I believe that there are sophisticated players were engaged in trying to either boost our signal or start to alter the sea somebody will be up somebody will be down and then there's like really weird Dynamics I think that there's a very strange thing going on not with Dave Rubin but with the crowd of people that is just trying to eat Dave Rubin and Rudman blind him and confuse him and this guy Sam Cedar who sings Russian I hope he is but I do think that is his I think he has a it's following I don't think this is inauthentic that just loves to dark harass what dunk drag I hate this language the disconsolate shitt on them and they also think it's cute to take anything that he says and interpreted in the worst possible way possible and not think of it as him just being a guy who's trying to talk about things on the Fly and maybe isn't even prepared about the subject at hand like Mustangs it comes up on this show you know when we were talking before we were going to go in there when talk about my yeah you don't know what the f*** is going to come up and you might have a piss poorly formed idea of what a subjective where they just feel like okay we got a wounded antelope I pick him off and you know I think there was probably a move to do Shapiro and there was a. Where you were seemingly in the crosshairs but you're hard to kill and you know I have no doubt that was in the crosshairs that's the benefit of not paying attention and this is something that I've been pretty rigorous about over the last six months while the years you Sam Harris and Dave Rubin have all given me versions of this advice and I worry about it because I'm not large enough yet that I've been the target of a steady campaign but what happens is you see people's feedback loops interrupted and in part to course-correct you kind of want to know cuz I would like to harsh with that guy went on with Jordan Peterson on Dave show I was more aggressive because I think I'd seen Jordan and Brett on your show together and I come from an ethnic family be interrupting each other that's normal and Jordan is an interrupter in though what I found is that I probably was in tooting that I had to be more forceful a lot of the comments that wow Eric I haven't really seen you this aggressive was it there three of you on a conversation it started off Dave Jordan in myself and then Ben Shapiro came in for an hour and I think Sam Harris might have been scheduled to come in and over there's an issue always more than one person there's a reason why do one-on-ones almost even when I had Bob Lazar with Jeremy Corbell just just having a third person that wants to chime in like oftentimes interrupts the flow of conversation like in that case it was because I wanted a lock in on Bob Lazar I wanted to get all my feed but I'm going to find out who's this guy full of s*** what I want I want to lock in with them but it works it can be magical and wax when it doesn't you know it's a little bit like jazz guys if that group is meant to be then they don't trip over each other solos they're trying to come up with something with three great friends I have this issue I mean it's really great stuff with multiple people on your show when it doesn't you know it's a little bit like jazz guys if that group is meant to be then they don't trip over each other solos they're trying to come up with something with three great friends I have this issue I mean it just in great stuff with multiple people on your show doesn't work</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> tour the Vatican I had a really great guy that was really cool took my family through this thing and he was he was professor and he was really happy that I was so curious about things so I don't want an apple and a small like what's going on with that and he was like that's a really important question and he's like back then the thought was that bigger penises were brutish and that they were that these you know you got to realize these are people that were fending off barbarians and the idea was that their gods would be beautifully proportioned but they would have these small sort of less dangerous penises. Peni Lil Dex all of them might these guys like if you looked at these guys like just the way they're built the reality is most of them would have Hogs right these are heavily muscled Stickman with a lot of testosterone they would have big dicks most likely that's the reason why protecting you from said barbarians is it true that the castrati of Italy were sought after as lovers they could still perform really yeah but then you didn't need to worry about pregnancy how could they they could get erect yet but they will never Castor that doesn't make any sense that wrong I think that's why they would do that they would have Unix operating formed on the castrati but I believe that there was a way in which they were sought after as lovers convention away plural for penis that's the right way to say it talks about a cox-2 how do you say that to Montes Montes Qui Qui they would have inspired a taste for Gamora and people whose taste is the least depraved what and when Casanova fell in love with a castrato who conveniently turned out to be a woman and drag he asked her to dress as a castrato in bed. I'm done check please to in quotes in soft Unix Place their blissed and shun the scrubbing bearded kissed yeah they wanted someone who eats a lot of p**** Affairs were idolized and safe but bed-hopping could be risky for the castrati one was assassinated by his Lover's Furious family and another who wrote to the pope requesting permission to marry on the basis of that his castration had been ineffective received a reply let him be castrated better the pope said no you can't get married we're going to cut your nuts off better banjo better job all mouth and no trousers castrati had more fun than you could think hello Guardian Samantha Singer who wishes he'd had the chop it's an adventure has been around for a long time. Now the last castrato was recorded see if there's actually require we play absolutely ridiculous selected area is is that right yeah Alessandro morichetti Morissette more SG Morris G Alessandro moreschi the last castrato Christ the complete Vatican recordings what they do that man's mouth while they had in there the right yeah Alessandro morichetti Morissette more SG Morris G Alessandro moreschi the last castrato Christ the complete Vatican recordings what they do that man's mouth while they had in there</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> and today's podcast today's podcast so first of all you can reach it now I finally got a website just Eric Weinstein. Org and I told you that we have to leave this planet and that because we can't all be as far as the best beaches in the United States and by the way you pointed at the gods but for the wisdom and that became a meme so I gave these lectures best quotes ever isn't it don't know which one he's probably but it's so right it's like every now and then so we can get the whole thing in a sentence we now God's but for the wisdom so that's why we have to get off this planet diversify because too many people have god-like powers Donald Trump commands a tremendous amount of Godlike power thanks for physics Community was ratings so so the best hope that I can come up with and it's a slim one is his if we could figure out what goes beyond Einstein's theory the einsteinian speed limit might be bendable or breakable because we would be in a framework that was larger than Einstein people off interpret this is what they call ftlr faster-than-light travel but that's not what I mean necessarily what I mean is that the underlying source code gives us opportunities that we don't normally have so seven years ago I tried it released I tried giving these lectures at Oxford which is probably the university that is spiritually closest to what I care about what you think about geometry and physics in the in a relationship that kept the face with a Faith with that tradition through people like Rodger Penrose and Michael attia and I released this theory of geometric Unity rather I released the video of the lecture that introduces this Theory so this was the first time since 1983-84 that I talked in public but when I started this program when I was 18 19 something like that and I just released the video today on our YouTube channel it is the video of you giving this discussion was introduced by professor Marcus du sautoy who has Richard Dawkins old job is the Simoni Professor for the public understanding of Science and he met me in a bar and you got me a little drunk I said okay what are you really working on and I told him and the first it sounded crazy and then he started thinking about it and he ask me more questions and you brought me over to Oxford you got me an appointment had me talk to their experts and then he decided that he wanted me to give these when he called the special Simoni lectures they are an attempt to go beyond Einstein to look for a unified theory of physics between the two major branches that have resisted unification and that's usually in the modern era confused with the idea of quantizing gravity but the Quant the quantum gravity imperative is a it's a political program that comes out of what would have been the quantum field Theory Community before it became the string theory community ideas we have to take Einstein to make him submit to the will of bore and I don't think it's exactly like that then I don't think they got it wildly wrong and they synchronize themselves and took the field off the cliff and they weren't able to ship a product they couldn't deliver on any of this promised so when I saw that they were about to go off a cliff I switch Fields as an undergraduate into mathematics and I use mathematics as a stalking horse to study the same sort of underlying structures but not to get sick the politics of physics and I had this Theory which I cannot talk about for the first time in like 37 years or whatever it is and like today's the first day that I'm sort of free because I've kept this to myself so if you want to ask any question about geometric Unity but why why did you keep this to yourself cuz I don't trust these people I know there was some people that doesn't matter if it's not them your system that believes in pure review it believes in for citations you have to be at a university have to get an endorsement to use their preprint server it's too few resources too many sharp elbows there's a logic to that Preserve making about it I'll find out that I'm wrong version of the theory alright first time ever do you know that start off with escher's drawing hands so do you Jamie do you have a picture for that the key problem that we have in a fundamental theory that people don't think about is not why is there some rather than nothing I don't think we can answer that it's why is there so much that is that is Rich out of almost nothing and so this issue shows that if you had a piece of paper could you will into being the hands holding pens using ink to draw each other right that problem is akin to the problem that we face in a fundamental theory if you had the canvas how would the canvas bring all of the richness that you see around you in to be and what I did was I said okay we have to go below Einstein to we have four degrees of freedom but they're not yet space and time is Proto space time but before and then I said okay that those four degrees of freedom are like the stands in stadium in the stands somehow need to build the pitch and the pitch is a 14 dimensional space so if let's imagine that you had. I've got four objects here so it's four degrees of freedom chords by the four objects that we need a ruler to measure how much of each of these four objects we have that would be for additional variables and then you have angles does lengthen angles what Einstein gave us in space-time so the angle between any two objects of the same as the reverse of the angle so then you can count it up in there 6 angles to be had so there's four degrees of freedom plus four rulers + 6 protractors just 14 so there's a 14 dimensional auxiliary space and in my estimation you and I are in some ways potentially having this conversation in a 14 dimensional world that we perceive back in the stands rather than on the pitch as a four-dimensional conversation that is we're in the three-dimensional room going for so I called this The Observers and The Observers is two spaces rather than Einsteins one space stop y14 Dimensions because I'm saying that the fields that is the stuff is dancing not mostly on the four dimensions that we think we perceive but it's also dancing on the rulers and the protractors so in other words I have XY and Z I need ruler next rest of the wise directions AZ to measure things and I need a watch which would be like a ruler in the time direct so those four rulers are in fact in play as well and they're the protractors because Like A Spacetime is 4 degrees of freedom plus rulers and protractors I'm saying work over the space of all rulers and all pro tractors as part of where these particles and field can dance so the rulers and the protractors are part of the system the choice of particular rulers in particular protractors so by choosing particular rulers in particular protractors Einstein is grabbing a tiny filament of the space of all possible rulers and protractors sew-in in effect space-time has recovered as the act of The Observers contemplating itself that's a little bit poetic but I mean that the choice of a space-time metric inside of the space of all metrics is a section of a 14 dimensional bundle over a Ford wellspace now that's the first sort of mind-bending weird thing is that this is not happening in one place it's happening in two places in X and Y the stands and the pitch the things that are happening in the stands and the things that are happening in the pitch so you know what when a guy is like trying to make a free throw and everybody's waving their giant noodles trying to get him to miss there's an interaction between what's happening in the stands and what's happening on the floor and at The Observers is the bundling of spaces and saying hey you you're confused as to what's going on here some fields are happening in the stands some fields are happening on the floor and their Everything feels as if it's happening in the stands cuz that's where you're sitting in some weird way then you got this really crazy stuff which I think one aspect of it is everybody in theoretical physics is looking to figure out whether there were three or more Generations that is copies of matter everything in this Next Generation 1 all made up of up quarks down quarks in electron so that works and down quarks give you protons and neutrons and electrons give you the sort of interesting personality of the various chemical elements are also neutrinos but they're streaming through us I'm not going to count them and that's all Generation 1 of matter so everything in that thing that is like plastic Lego then there's another Lego set made out of wood and then there's another Lego set made out of like lead you know and we don't see those other two Lego sets and except if we're doing great energetic experiments so there were three copies of matter and everybody was trying to figure out three or more and I thought maybe it's two or fewer until one of the aspects of this theory is that the third generation of matter is an impostor it looks like this generation of matter in terms of its particle personalities but if you actually to heat up the system it would unify with a bunch of particles nobody's ever seen before and so their predictions for what does new part of Breezewood be there's also a fourth pseudo generation of what would be called spin 3/2 matter is not prohibited but has never been seen as a fundamental so it makes predictions for the particle properties of new spin half a new spin 3 has particles it attempts to say that there are sectors of matter that I think decoupled that the universe is not in fact Left Right asymmetric which would be called chirality and if you think about week 4 so if you have a new Neutron on a table little to K and I think something like 17 minutes on average half life when it decays there's an asymmetry in that decay called beta Decay and that was found by a woman ramp Madam Lu from Columbia and the cobalt-60 experiment so in the 50s this this gal Madam woo should have won a Nobel Prize discovered that when cobalt-60 decay do beta Decay the electrons come spin out one side and not the other meaning that the universe is like Marilyn Monroe or Cindy Crawford having a birthmark that lets you tell the left from the right so this is like the ultimate experimental badass who never got recognized fully she did an experiment based on work of Yang and Lee that for the first time showed that the Universe had a preference of one of its leftover it's right if you I don't believe that preferences fundamental I believe that there's another copy of matter that so the analogy I give is that if you think you look at your three fingers in the center of your hand your middle finger which is my favorite is obviously symmetrical bad self your digit ratio 2 and 4 is pretty close but is determined by the amount of testosterone you're exposed to In Utero and then your thumb and your pinky are wildly off but you could try to make it symmetric and say while you you know I think he's like a lame from which it isn't if you're just looking at your hand you're trying to figure out why is my hand asymmetrical but you don't realize that you got another hand and it's thumb to thumb thumb to pinky that is the symmetry so when you going to place your fingertips together you see that if you didn't know if you're like all oversexed out and you can only see part of your body you think about other world is asymmetric while my belief is that it in week gravitational situations this other matter couples so you only see one hand or the other and we're we're all in one handed so what I'm starting to do is that I'm terrified of talking about the stuff I don't have the right credentials not a physicist I've been out of this game for forever so I often say the wrong things and break rules and who knows what and I haven't really talked about it this is like really a very lonesome I've been completely alone on this project what do you think the end result of this project potentially could be cuz you're saying we could get off this planet what do you like what are you talking about in terms of the actual implementation of this this theory of yours so Jamie if you could bring up my answer to the final Edge question which is what is the last question John Brockman asked when the final year that he conducted the annual Edge question and that is the annual Edge question yes he would ask 200 people many of them physicists and biologists or mathematicians you'd ask question and then write an essay and then every year he publishes a book if I did that for 10 years finally got tired of it and he said okay this is my final year we've exhausted this what is the last question so this is the question that I asked so does something unprecedented happen when we finally learn our own source code and nobody picked up on this but that's not my concern is which is what happens when the universe finally contemplates itself when we are the first Uber always worried about the AI becoming self-aware I'll ask Ina it okay we are the AI and we're about to become self aware if we can figure out what around source code is so we are skyknit so you're talkin about the source code of reality itself and that are percent are limited perception reality are giving us a distorted view of what the landscape actually is where I'm trying to make sure I was somewhat holding this back because I'm afraid of what it unlocks and now that I know that we're willing to elect Donald Trump not store masks play footsie with China be Putin's b**** all of the stuff to hell with this we're going to Miss Manners this planet into Armageddon if we don't get some grown-ups into the room and so I don't know that I'm a grown up but I'm willing to Vie for leadership by putting something up having it investigated and seeing where it goes what is your number one fear about this this source code being I don't know the lack of a better term mastered well the last time we gained some serious insight into the way nuclei worked that with a little bit of geometry from Stanislaus William and Edward Teller give us the the namesake of the bikini that was a terrifying moment we change everything changed in 1900 that was 54 the namesake of the bikini a Bikini Atoll was an island in the Pacific where we blew up a hydrogen device is that that and set those insane images where you can see the water going a mile high into the sky gorgeous until you went to your question what if what so it's still expensive to create Fusion devices so we don't know of any individuals who owned the ability to create Fusion devices your call at some point somebody made a functioning nuclear reactor out of discarded smoke detectors and ran and got like 500 smoke detectors took out the radioactive element created a reactor probably kid who couldn't get into Harvard so we have a situation in which we don't know when he ordinary humans will gain Limitless destructive power going to try to imagine the Columbine kids weaponizing viruses or something like that so one of the great dangers is that great power I can't tell what the power would be at the theory is correct it might give us the ability Escape Escape though why do we have to escape this is so confused about like cuz even 21 talks about going to Mars I'm convinced that we don't have the ability to store this place why we were a thousand years so Genghis Khan was doing a better job Genghis Khan was doing a better job because he didn't have Limitless power just try to imagine it try to imagine a full-on nuclear interchange and then we're having this conversation afterwards so you you're concerned that nuclear war is not to possible but inevitable it certainly inevitable given them long enough time series is not possible but inevitable it certainly inevitable given them long enough time series because all these weapons simply will become cheaper there's no countermeasure that we it's too easy to destroy things relative to building</div>

Have you seen penis fencing in flatworms penis fencing with flatworms so this is like in terms of why do people who like social engineering not like biology flatworms have two different life cycles a male and a female life cycle and they don't know when they encounter each other and romance called whether or not they will be male or female and it's decided by a violent contest so they've got two plural penis to stab each other and whoever penetrates the other succeeds in what might be termed a traumatic insemination and the loser is assigned the feminine gender right so the idea is but it's more costly to Bear the young than it is to pierce the opponent so female is given to the loser whoa so they just do battle until someone f**** the other one right and that person becomes a check now bed bugs bed bugs have no vaginal opening hey there a female can bear young is a female attacks her thorax and breaks it open in an act which is definitely called traumatic insemination so you know you have a situation in which violent rape is the only method by which females can leave young so what they do to you they are the the feminists worst nightmare species you and I talked about the natural world they blow up like balloons I think so if you see one that's flat it hasn't really gorged ish anyways we had them under control I believe due to DDT and butter on my of 10 nightmare species bedbugs and flatworms for the twin traumatic insemination I would be way up at the top so it's like so they they literally puncture through the thorax with another we go Christ yeah if there is a good Lord boy does he or she have a lot to answer for why did you make bedbugs and why'd you make it like that imagine what kind of natural selection takes place where the only way that you can reproduce is through violent rape what's interesting there's a different system which I think is fascinating which is there's a conserved quantity in dung beetles where they have weaponry on their heads in the form of antlers for fighting the males and it turns out that there's an inverse relationship so there's some research it's allocated between the copulatory equipment and the Weaponry that the that the that the that the dung beetle has if they have a lot of weapons out there goes the Sean Connery monster truck. If you don't have it going on you got to go get yourself so what happens is that the size of the copulatory apparatus maybe the engine of speciation that when a male's equipment no longer fits the female that maybe the Q that some dung be some dung beetles will speciate because they can't reproduce effectively and we don't know why the conserved quantity would be spread between fighting equipment which is used only to displace Rivals and the size of the package</div>

You do this by being on particular committees rotating directorships who pays the cost I I don't know how the who seems to be sew in meshed with China and I I don't want to apine about these things because I want to keep my voice but it spoke volumes to watch that guy do that do that little dance to avoid entire life looks like that interview dority and it might be critique is is that this is the generic expectation across almost all institutions now they are all serving bizarre goals because growth is what gave us our independence and when we became less Innovative and we Innovation dried up and we couldn't grow our way in to do things the number of people who could use their middle finger effectively and say I'm steering this this organization to do right thing and this is my bed and I'm working to go forward those people as a class were removed if you think about like what do you do with Churchill when there is in the World War II in we don't know when there's an emergency there's a guy named Jai prakash Narayan in India is very important he was one of the sort of founding father Modern India and after India Indian independence was achieved lots of the people have been founding fathers went to the next phase where they became like they enrich themselves they did standard political things to eat to gain power in the system he was the one guy who sort of stayed true to the Revolutionary spirit and bizarrely when Indira Gandhi created a state of emergency which was a disaster in India the people said we'll who can we turn to in a dark time and ugly I guess prakash me light so there's this phrase like in the darkness there is one light jaiprakash jayprakash I prakash they turned to the one guy who become the patron saint of lost causes because he never broke Faith with the Revolutionary spirit and he said he gets called up once but he's incredibly important because everybody knows in a dark time who they can trust right that's a very important parallel to where we are who are the break glass in case of emergency people yeah when you when you watch the people that are talking in these presidential addresses there's none of those I don't see any break glass me this fauci guy is obviously an expert and diseases and he's a doctor and he's trying to do his best to lay out the ground rules of what we need to do and what this looks like over the next couple of months but there's like Jocko willink you don't like I was not telling you don't worry you don't have to change your routine you can get up at 9:30 just a little bit a little bit discipline equals Freedom I'm up at 4:30 what are you doing in bed it's time for discipline while because he's a military guy and military people don't have any room for bulshit fuckyourfeelings get up at 4:30 that's that's how they feel that's what I'm pretty sells those you can just do a little bit and that's great that's great you guys are enforcing mediocrity can grab both ends and that's what I'm trying to get out which is which we have a situation where we know you have two trainers and one of them is doing the don't worry the other ones like you're going to be sore you're going to be miserable this isn't going to be fun which do you choose some people go with the former yeah Claudia you're going to be sore you're going to be miserable this isn't going to be fun which do you choose some people will go with the former yeah they like to stay fat out there okay</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> episodes of might have my pocket as I watched it off of this one episode OU brother no I did not listen that one okay I've only listen to five or six if you listen to it episode 19 which is the bread episode I think that's been the most important one in except for the one released today that sounds like for the One release today well free about his prediction that all the laboratory mice that we use from the major supplier which of the Jackson laboratory in Bar Harbor Maine may have been compromised by their breeding protocols which allowed the telomere is to radically elongate and that we thought these mice were representative of all mice and that they had radically elongated telomere at the end of their chromosomes which appear to mediate the level of mitosis that can happen during histologic repair so if you imagine that your cells can divide a certain number of times if if there isn't the counter that stops the number of Divisions everything can become tumors and since you have like 30 trillion or a hundred trillion cells in your body that means every cell almost can kill you so it appears that the reason we may die from senescence that is aging is that that's our anticancer mechanism so if you eliminate like infect Steve's like viruses and insult from Munich being hit by a car the two things that you have in the end is either you die from immortality which is cancer which were cells can divide an infinite number of times or you die from the recursion limit which is how many times the cell to divide called in biology the hayflick limit and Brett predicted from first principles that what we thought about my switches that they have radically elongated telomere is it was only true for Batory animals because all the laboratory animals in which we test things like drugs have been broken they've been broken because of selective breeding yep because the breeding rotations privileged much younger mice and removed all sort of threats from the environment and so because telomere is are not protein-coding sequences of nucleotides that repeat as a counter rather than coding for a translation in the ribosome into amino acid sequence what you have is that the body can mutate if you will until use the Jackson Laboratories concept of this very rapidly because it's not building something structural just a question of do we have 17 on the end or a hundred and seventy on the end because the exacting nucleic acid has multiple ways in which it can participate in regulating the body's responses sewing fat the breeding protocols constituted a novel system of selective pressures that destroy the efficacy of all of our laboratory animals potentially so not be predicted from first principles he said I bet if you test wild-type mice rather than laboratory mice you'll find that their telomeres are not long as you believe in this was actually carried out by Carol greider who did not acknowledge the prediction she didn't acknowledge you should listen to the shop it's it's it's no cuz it's it's it's the Nobel Laureate on the other side of this so we're taking some risk over there over there at the portal that's really interesting so the consequences of this could be grave could be that so much of the studies that are predicated on these mice tests are there useless but called at the Jackson laboratory and ask them when did you have you had any changes in your breeding are you missing we don't even count the number of telomere telomere like when I say do you have a history of when you change the breeding Protocols are you aware of these articles and she said like what I said you know these articles of Carol greider how do you spell glider like the Plain City Grider like the Nobel Laureate and how do you spell greider and sew in the next to me while we don't remember if we've changed the protocol I said you're producing laboratory animals I would imagine you would have a documented history of every change in the time series of how these animals were prepared why don't know if there's anyone around from it are you kidding were you absent the day they taught science who are you or if true I can't even we've been at for 20 years we've been trying to get an answer as 20 years no one will break the story I mean this episode which is almost impossible to listen to because at the beginning of the episode I'm absolutely insufferable to Brett because he won't tell the story he's afraid to tell his own life story story because in academics the idea of some punk kid alleging that they predicted in Nutella call to a Nobel Laureate that if they would test wild-type mice the telomeres would be radically along radically shorter than the elongated telomeres of the Laboratory test and then the person refuses to acknowledge that such a prediction was made even though we have emails from the lab that so she refuses to acknowledge it or she cannot find a single I've been over the literature there is no anywhere of I live this was bread in real-time sorry I I know the events were happening we have communications with that lab since there is I cannot find any acknowledgment from the Johns Hopkins University laboratory that this interaction ever took place and that because he called and wrote and did not write an email he did not have a paper trail of that now there's consequential consequential emails that show the interaction between the labs but how many times have you ever heard anyone predict a molecular result from first principles and evolutionary theory this is what Brett was supposed to be famous for and then you know he he became like this obscure professor at some ridiculous college and then this thing happen to him but that's not his origin story his origin story is that he is the badass biology it was able to make this prediction for first principles and may have advanced the theory of why we have to die balance between deaths from immortality that is tumors and deaths from recursion limits that is telomere mediated hyflux pay for equipment so if anything has been done since this information has gotten out the world went crazy for the episode and there was silence everywhere inside of what all the Gated institutional narrative because to technology they really have to throw out how much research we don't know I don't know but it puts the question out how much research is compromised by the laboratory breeding protocols and breeding rotations from a single point of failure the Jackson laboratory in Bar Harbor Maine wow episode 19 or you will just say Eric is the biggest dick I've ever heard in my life but it's all to push this Brett to actually talk you should have mac on the show to talk but it's it's killing adamant Beretta simply wrong it's a it's a result and a story that needs to be told if they're another side of the story we need to hear the other side of the story and my goal is to have Carol greider so you know what this interaction did happen and I probably could have handled this better because she has work that she's done which is beyond question some of the most important work that has nothing to do with anything bread is done but it does not give that laboratory the scientific right to deny the existence of this interaction the importance of the internet and because their potential Downstream consequences in Pharmaceuticals we need to have an answer and every answer is interested if the laboratory mice having radical radical elongated telomeres is not a problem in some way that's fascinating how could you have an animal that has this huge adaptation to the laboratory not affect that would be interesting if it does affect thing that's fascinating Tesla that have anything to do with Helen Mirren what do but if it doesn't have to do like for example let's say you have a really toxic substance right and it causes a lot of seldat that requires histological repair if you have a huge long telomeres you're going to have an ability to metabolize that toxicity very much better you'll be able to take the insult to comes from this and so these mice are probably preternatural Adidas towards radical histological repair that's why they remain youthful and young and if you test something that might be in a few doing toxicology studies it could be that the telomere is even though you're not testing the teal and mirrors what you're actually doing is picking up that these broken mice are like the world Champs of repair but they suck it cancer they all died of cancer all of them almost essentially all the mice elongated of cancer because their trick for one special thing which is the best it repair of death and clear away all of the noise there two ways that that nature can't figure out an escape from either you dive in mortality which is that you think all your cells wanted want to live forever you know and that's a huge death huge danger or we caught a resource lately can computers or they died the only thing nature can figure out to do is to say you only get a finite number of cell divisions up front now that there's some adjustments to the theory but if you only got it like if you if you look at the moles on my face with your people love to comment on comment section they probably started as a runaway Reptar replicative process that arrested at the border of the mole in order to keep them from killing me right we have sell the Grove all the we have sell the Grove all the time but then what happens is that there's some means of making sure that if the process doesn't take down the entire organism but think about 30 trillion assassins as the cells in your body all of which might kill you at any moment like terrifying</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> they get rid of mosquitoes there will always be and I think that is a possibility that something they've talked about doing is engineering some new kind of mosquito that like doesn't breed or some mosquito that kills other mosquitoes or or something along those lines if they've had a couple of different things that they try to figure out how to do but the problem is you don't want to do that you know you let that cat out of the bag mosquitoes and the cats reading the lizards who knows what kind of s*** could go down to get rid of mosquitoes but they do the dirty blood give you a malaria disease that but that's about all these pandemics is like you know coronavirus is actually kind of a p**** and it's it's easy to kill there's other viruses with your much tougher but as a very thin membrane is it's a fatty membrane that goes over it and you know foam from soap make sure when you wash your hands the corona Psalms the new strain of coronavirus not previously seen in humans or other strains of cannabis are very common and usually only calls mild symptoms like the common cold yeah what we just talking about we're talking about washing hands Coronavirus and it scared me way more than that lets me and it's scary for sure don't get me wrong but there's is chronic wasting disease that they found in Deer and it's 100% fatal and it's a prion disease the same same kind of disease is mad cow disease was and the same as mad cow disease made the jump to humans then it became very dangerous and people to the some people to this day like they can't give blood cuz they were alive eating cheeseburgers during the madcap of days maybe they release that a long time they couldn't give blood cuz they had to be that you stole these prions in your system you could they took the surgical instruments that they used on patients who died of mad cow disease and they ran the surgical instruments through these sanitization machines the center process sanitizing process 3 * 3 * 1000 degree temperature couldn't kill it three times still had living prions on the surgical equipment yeah I know we got to do is soap It up sing Happy Birthday twice the sun nothing in comparison to something that could happen to us if chronic wasting disease ever made the leap from dear to Hummus my friend Doug Duren and Bryan what's his name again Planet Wildlife expert explained all of it to us like what what it is how it's happened how it's spread it spreading from deer and do the end is horrific we watched a video of one of them where they're wasting away and is spitting so this this this this fluids coming out their body is contaminated in the deer will come along and eat the leaves that have that prion on it and take it in then you'll get it'll get chronic wasting disease it'll rot away and spitting out the stuff and other deer eating it's horrific and it's 100% fatal so think about what we've got that your immune system you know for the vast majority of the people is going to fight off tragic the people that don't not to mention that at all that's not what I'm saying but there's a giant difference between something that Idris Elba gets and shows no weaknesses shows no symptoms rather or Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson get it and they get over it it's rough but they get over and they survived versus prions The Chill hundred percent of all the deer that they in fact they're all dead and they weigh the way suite at nothing it's ugly wow I know this guy was selling the warning Bell he was like the Visa made the jump to mice and they prions have made the jump from animals to people this is totally possible this this can't happen yeah and it's like right now it's like this like silent thing that they're just keeping an eye on and it's spreading across the country and people don't know like just places where people stopped eating deer meat and there's a checkpoint we have to bring the deer in like Wisconsin or my friend Doug they bring the deer and have to test them before you can eat this dinner chronic wasting that came from a deer that has CWD but it's never made the jump to people so have the sausage you're eating the prions they just don't affect your brain yet about 7,000 to 15,000 animals infected with CWD are eaten each year and that number to rise by 20% annually according to the alliance for public Wildlife which osterholm cited in his testimony scientists can't say for sure that CWD will crossover infect humans But as time goes on and more infected meat is consumed the likelihood increases said it's like a throw at the genetic roulette table he said f*** that yeah but if that gets into the cows what if that gets into your cheeseburger this is maybe with the whole vegan movements about maybe trying to protect us from an ultimate attack what if that's the only people that survive I really thin and I know the self-righteous all the guys would have to have man buns have to get a velcro man bun and put it on just to get through security meat eaters would like get a velcro man bun and put it on just to get through security</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> he brought up that I wanted to discuss is the damage that this virus does to the lungs and two to the heart as well what they're scarring on on people's lungs of the talk about that and what if anything can be done to try to heal those people post infection well so what happens is in the virus gains entry into the deep passages of the lungs know the the all the airway spaces and then it if you ever see a cartoon a schematic drawing of a coronavirus it looks like a little ball with spikes sticking out of it and those spikes are called the S protein and actually the vaccine that we're making interferes with The Binding of a part of that as protein called the receptor binding domain for binding into the receptor so it's uses those spikes the tip of the spikes to get entry to bind to The receptors and in the long which is actually a an enzyme called an acetylcholinesterase in the lung cells so the first thing that happens is a large amount of viruses getting into the lungs and that triggers What's called the innate immune system eating your natural first-line body of defense and its signal something called toll-like receptors which caused a lot of inflammation and so you're seeing a big inflammatory response to the to the virus of the two components post all the inflammatory response and that's one of the reasons why you know what I heard about hydroxychloroquine I have some enthusiasm cuz it may be suppressed inflammatory component whether it clinically has the ability to make a difference I think the jury's still out yet but so you got those two things going on other thing that's happening besides inflammation in a condition known as a RDS acute respiratory distress syndrome where there's so much information and scarring that it becomes difficult to oxygenate the lungs and people go into shock because of this a RDS syndrome so that's why a lot of people are dying the other thing that happened so that we don't really understand a lot of reports XIV and Med archive is m e d r XIV Spotify Cold Spring Harbor laboratory the scientist have been great about sharing information they're putting all their stuff up on these preprint server they're not peer-reviewed yet but just that we get information into the hands of the scientist anybody could look at them but one of the other things were seeing with that is a lot of heart entry weather people are having heart attacks because they're intubated in the ICU and under stress and and they're in shock so they're not perfusing hardcore and we know that the old SARS virus ours one had the ability to go into the heart tissue and cause what's called myocarditis actual infection of the heart so it's really the heart and lungs that that are getting knocked out there's also some evidence that the virus can go into the intestinal tract as well and so that I could actually be a router transmission hammered is this direct damage from the virus and inflammatory component to the heart and lung infection particularly like damage to the lungs immune response to the virus so you can have an increased number of a virus particle potentially be so people are definitely looking into steroids other I am time inflammatory drugs but you know those who survive this and fortunately most do you know you'll find it there. Probably tell you they've been hacking and coughing for a long time afterwards in a lot of that is viral pneumonia is it stopped with the virus is all that scarring is is it takes the body a long time to remodel all the scar tissue and then before the coughing stop so we can anticipate that happening as well epidemic to know what's going on is it it's just really too early for so many of these things the treatment secures the dealing with the immune system's finding out which people are genetically more predisposed to make a contribution figure scientist has just been an amazing everyone's you're putting aside their Rico putting all their stuff up on bioarchive met archiving and then and the major journals are doing incredible things also Expediting publication of paper so you know the the flagship journals like New England Journal of Medicine Lancet Jama they're all putting that stuff out there as fast as they can you know as ensuring quality inn and Anna level of peer review r+ family journals Public Library science so good stories that are happening around this definitely the data sharing the journals not conducting business the stuff that their publishing could be life-saving and responding to a Public Health crisis I think that that's the nice part of the story the data sharing the journals not conducting business as usual recognizing that their the stuff that their publishing could be life-saving and responding to a Public Health crisis I think that that's the nice part of the story</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> is it one of the things that's come up about this is people are now aware people like myself are aware of the the number of people that die every year in the United States from the flu which is staggering it's a lot more than I ever thought before you know what do you know the numbers like what would between 12 and fifty thousand people die every year of influenza and the vast majority of those by the way you're not vaccinated so even in years where there's not a good match between the flu vaccine in the flu and could still reduce your likelihood of hospitalization and and deaths that's important message to get out the numbers here unfortunately looking worse so you from being hospitalized because it is partially protective so if you imagine a virus that has all of these different pieces to it and and the end and all the antibodies each reacting to a different piece of the virus and a perfect match all of the antibodies Target the virus and then in a less than perfect match only some of the antibodies Target the virus and therefore it's partially protective and can have whatever partial effect and so now the numbers of them of Americans were dying or all over the map so if you if you believe the number saying that they're between 4 and 10 times the number of Americans forget about Mary Florida 10 times the regular flu thousand from flu the minimum that's going to die from covid-19 is around 50,000 and at the high end times 10 could be between 500,000 so that's where you're hearing those numbers from the White House Press Conference today saying maybe a hundred to two hundred thousand Americans could die I think it's probably I like the institute for health metrics numbers that just came out they say 84,000 Americans will die in that peak season going from by April May May and June and then but we don't know what will happen again in the out here so the point is a lot of Americans are going to die I'm hoping it doesn't get as high as 200,000 and again the modelers are really looking at this that those numbers that I gave sophisticated those numbers I gave you that estimate was a certain simplistic version but there's much more sophisticated models but again their models based on assumptions about the new virus pathogen it's hard to get all the assumptions right but the point is I many more people will die of this virus than even in a bad flu season</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I'm hoping so much of what comes out of this is a wake-up call so much of the new-found understanding and appreciation for the science behind dealing with these diseases appreciation of healthcare workers and First Responders mean if there's any bright lining to this that's what I'm really hoping for is it people wake up and recognize the good work that people like you have been doing and also you know that this is what we live in strange times and these things can happen again and we need to be prepared we need to put a lot of emphasis in effort and thought to that as a whole is a whole society but that's right I think you know maybe this will help us reassess some of our values and and you know appreciate some of the some of the things that the healthcare professions especially you're doing and how you're seeing people volunteered you know you know do said the hell with then I'm just going to put on my n95 mask and my PPE and dive in and helping that's really moving and safety equipment for healthcare workers and how did this ever happen while we just we didn't get ready for the surgeon time I think you know I'm holding back trying to throw stones at this agency or this person or this group because we don't really know what happened I think it's going to be really important that Congress after this and to conduct an investigation not from the standpoint of Prosecuting people or or calling them out but just say hey what the hell went wrong here and how do we avoid this again I mean the problems with the testing and not having all the protective equipment now we're getting geared up and mobilizing industry but could we have done better especially in that window. When things were collapsing in Wuhan and the other cities in central China when we knew this was going to be bad and we know this could become your one of the great pandemic threats in a wide how could we have better use those six weeks in order to get ready in one month than we do and hand and now is not the time to do it because worrying about you know Congressional hearings and that sort of thing but when all this is said and done and it has to be that have to be done in the right Spirit not again we have to figure out a way to stop these partisan lines to say there was is a country we've got to figure out how to work together I know that sounds pollyannish but you know Washington University I work with Congress a lot to get legislation passed around neglected tropical diseases and I was a different Washington then I mean I would go you know to Sam brownback's prayer breakfast Sam Brownback governor of Kansas before we center from Kansas very conservative Republican senator walk across the hall and go talk to Center to Leahy's people from vermonters or Sherrod Brown's people and we all knew we had to go across the aisle to work together and it's just not happening anymore and it's tearing apart our country so I hope the other thing that we get out of this is figuring out a way that Republican start talking to Democrats again and Democrats talk to Republicans again and figure that out as well sing anymore and it's tearing apart our country so I hope the other thing that we get out of this is figuring out a way that Republicans start talking to Democrats again and Democrats talk to Republicans again and figure that out as well</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> pecan Sweden and Sweden the way they're handling this which is essentially they're giving people the freedom to go to restaurants and bars and they're shutting some things down but there was quite a bit more open than the rest of the world and subsequently there they're experiencing a spike in cases ships would come into the Barber on Croatian and coming from Asia Minor and they were fearful they're bringing plague and they kept the ships for 40 days that's the word for the word quarantine came from and that's what we've got right now so we know social distancing is probably Our Only Hope and and there's a few pieces of evidence for that I miss real serious social distancing my colleague I'm doing a lot of analysis and modeling in one of the things he's shown is that it when he looks at the cities in China for instance where they did social distancing another aggressive measures and some of them were pretty aggressively couldn't even do an in the United States but they showed that the longer you allow transmission to go on before you intervene with social distancing another things the worst the surgeon the worst the epidemic and therefore us about Natalie the worst immortality so Francis in Wuhan where he estimates I think I forget the exact spot about six weeks or transmission going out before you intervene then it was lights out it was a massive Surge and hospital system getting overwhelmed in a lot of healthcare workers getting sick and and I want to come back to that point after we finish this as opposed to in southern China and other places in China where you intervened after a week then you got in there was a difference mm patients in your eyes used across the city versus 20 that's how the dramatic a different so that's a lesson we need to learn for the u.s. is that's the only thing we have and to really push hard on the social distancing and I think it's especially important in the cities because it looks to me like what we're seeing so far in the u.s. is more of an urban Suburban vs. rural / we're seeing the big surges and ICU patients cities in rural areas although dr. fauci Africa's last night of the other night said don't ignore the rural areas either because we don't know what's going to happen there so social distancing is absolutely Paramount and unfortunately what's happening because things got so f***** up with the testing that we've not we've sumped unfortunately Bop and found out that transmission is going out for several weeks only one a lot of ICU patients started hitting the door so this is what happened in New Orleans it's probably happening is Detroit the mayor of Atlanta just said you know all of a sudden we've had all of these people show up in in the eye and the ICU so that's a another lesson learned we really not only doing the the diagnostic testing but the social distancing is really important and I've been on calls with the leadership of people in Houston because you know you're right it's it's it's hurting the economy in so many ways but you know if you want to prevent Houston from replicating the New Orleans experience I've been saying to the to the mayor and everyone else in Houston this is unfortunately what we're going to have to do in the models are showing that the Pacific Oregon Institute in Washington Seattle Washington and it's looking at the things to look at the I'm not only epidemic diseases but also chronic non-communicable diseases diabetes heart disease and mental health issues but they've been you know all hands on deck at this epidemic and they've just put it out on their website it's Health Data. Organ you go to The Cove in 19th sign and what they're showing is that they anticipate the peak of this epidemic in the US is going to hit about the middle of April so we're not even at the peak yet this is going to continue to go up and in some places like in Texas is going to be delayed it's probably going to be around around May 2nd and I think California was was around there as well so their number say it's going to be the next two months that are going to be the crunch-time when it's going to start really going up and then as we move into later in May will start to go down and maybe really bought him out by by June of course again what I've been saying is you know the President yesterday or the day before said okay I understand I said Easter now we're going to go to April 30th and my point is well April 30th things are still going to be peeking in parts of the country let's use April 30th as a time to reassess and then make a decision whether we go another month let's go a month at a time for now until we know where this is heading now we're going to go to April 30th and my point is well April 30th things are still going to be peeking in parts of the country let's use April 30th as a time to reassess and then make a decision whether we go another month let's go a month at a time for now until we know where this is heading</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> given that I think a lot of us don't believe in anything that happened before Google bright imagine kids today imagine trying to describe the kids today what it was like to grow up without the internet or not being able to reach people you have to make extensive plans and backup plans will it if you're not there at this time I used to have to yell when I was in high school my family got an answering machine house if this is incredible and you would you would leave like stupid music like to let everybody know you were cool like you have some cool music at cage Joe not here right now but if you leave a message I'll get back to you probably like the late eighties really yeah I actually call people like that I've been doing that more lately yeah I call a lot of people now I just feel like it's just it's better that the texting thing to problem is if it's very interesting how we separated ourselves into this electronic communication world where I will during the day be in communication almost constantly with a stream of people the only two stops it is a pause podcast is my rest for three hours I'm not talking to anybody other than you so all those texts that come through I'll get the end of the podcast I'll go and look at my phone WD-40 text sometimes cuz this is man that's if I had to make 40 phone calls that mean it would be impossible to manage it would be constantly becoming and you never really be able to say anything so we're we're feeding into this weird Loop where we just have these short form things tomorrow sure what time how about 9 I can do 7 okay let's do it you never mean to like these weird little bursts of information to oversee a member this program California and is it called the Californication guess I wasn't sure what the right so there's this scene where he's having some really hot intergenerational sex and this gal says like LOL and it killed it it out loud she said it and she says LOL and he who's the total interest that there's no amount of of heat in the moment that can compensate for the fact that she's using like verbal emojis yeah but he's just mocking himself over 50 it's intrinsically ironic but you know in terms of this weird thing about islands of time one of the things that we do is we have Shabbat dinner and every Friday no matter how atheist and militant people are against any kind of organized religion they will leave us alone if we say we're going into Shabbat and so there's this thing about like people will pester me in all sorts of situations but if I invoke something that is vaguely religious even Sam Harris probably wouldn't call me during that period of time. I find that very interesting I could you could you create a religion that was simply there to make sure that you had some time off line yeah I know if I text Ben Shapiro I'm not getting a text back on Saturday ever is dark yep the people I mean on one hand I think it's probably a really good idea to just take a break from all that electronic s*** and just connect with humans and in a very old school type of way I think it's probably very good for connect with yourself I had this experience I actually lived in Jerusalem for two years and we landed in this Orthodox Run Hotel and on Friday night everything shutdown you don't like the text and I then moved into a an ultra-orthodox neighbor neighborhood bread in the on the boundary of the place with the secular in the Orthodox mad what was really fascinating to me as I started telling people you know you'd never think that it's great not to be able to find a restaurant or a nightclub but it's amazing that it's this is enforced down time in about a month in somebody said oh you're in the wrong place of course you can go out on Friday I used to go to that of the Russian compound and that everything's hopping and you can go dancing and drinking and all these things after I knew that I went dancing and drinking and I was much less happy than believing that somehow Israel actually shut down on Friday night and so very weirdly I appreciated the constraint as soon as I knew you could break the constraint I was less happy and I would never actually a band anymore in that like it would provide you some Freedom by having restrictions but it does give you some Freedom like okay like now we have to think about all these other things so now we have the freedom to just be alone now we have the freedom to be relaxed now we have the freedom to just talk to human beings you know what the constraints and it's like totally that's like this motherfukers up at 4:30 in the morning throwing heavy weights around and grunting and acting like a Savage running goes out to the beach and he earns the sunrise every morning goes out and takes photos you know takes a photo of his f****** watch for 30 hit the gym like a Savage and then takes a photo sometimes of the sunrise are in the sunrise and like to but you would think God is like a prison till like force yourself into that but no no freedom in that because he knows decisions 4:30 is going to do you just you just go do it and that way if you look at the guy's a f****** tank why is your tank cuz he's always up at 4:30 f****** throwing weights around it just doesn't need never stops never never takes never takes a self-indulgent time to lay in bed and beat off and pick his nose and in the f****** check his text messages this right now and thinking maybe I do a little bit I think I remember reading his inner dialogue about going to a birthday party and breaking down and having a scoop of ice cream or something or slice of pie and it's like they are the drama of there it was Temptation eventually I became weak do you have the drama of there it was Temptation eventually I became weak yeah I don't fuk with that I just do it so I'm going to parties eat that cake I mean that's feel like I do enough I'm alright</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> how long can we go I mean what what if you take economics out of it what would you think if there was no concern whatsoever about economic loss in the damage to the economy what would you recommend in terms of just clearly just purely from a medical perspective so although not entirely true because we can make weekend in Acton or intervention so hopefully by the summer this is not going to be a huge problem but but we don't know and then we also don't know if this thing's coming back so what did the out-years look like is this does the even if it goes down this summer does it does it come back up again in the fall does it come back up again early next why would that happen why would it come back why would it want me to go away and then come back in the fall well is a few things that are happening one all the social distancing potentially could interrupt the transmission we use the number called the reproductive number which describes the number of people that get infected if a single individual has it so the number right now is between 2 and 4 depending on whose numbers you look at the ideas you bring up a little one by the social distancing there's also the question seasonality to this virus and again the Skylark lipstick has done some studies to show that they're there seems the virus infection doesn't seem to be as severe in areas that have higher temperatures in Greater humidity that's a bit of a soft call but maybe there's going to be some seasonality to this as well and then and so let's use an example of another seasonal virus influenza it speaks of course enter Then goes down in the summer months and never really disappears but it it it it goes down but then in the southern hemisphere is the opposite so in the southern hemisphere Peak flu season is our summer there winter in places like Australia and then in the tropics it's about the same all year round so we don't really understand seasonality potentially the virus could show it starts showing a pattern like that and then the question I ordered some kind of seasonality these are all scenarios that never being looked at so princes are our vaccine if it's used and goes you know go through all the clinical testing hurdles probably is not going to be used for this 2020 epidemic if it's used it all it's going to be used in the out years if this virus starts to come back on a regular basis are vaccine if it's used in ghost you know go through all the clinical testing hurdles probably is not going to be used for this 2020 epidemic if it's used it all it's going to be used in the out years if this virus starts to come back on a regular basis</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> let's talk about treatments that are being considered we know that zpacks or one of them and chloroquine can explain that and what went horribly wrong with the couple that took the wrong kind of chloroquine and turned out to be a koi pond cleaner certain things ready now so and then and then we can talk about what I want and then I'll let me give you the framework that answer your chloroquine question so the highest bar there is in terms of financial investment required in time to show a safeties of vaccine so that's what that's what we're doing and other groups are doing next tear down that's going to be in 18 months away according to dr. fauci could be longer than that next tear down small molecule drug new drugs that have never been discovered before it still takes a while maybe not as hire bars vaccine in terms of time the next tear down is repurposing existing medicines that we already know are relatively safe and then showing that those drugs also work against the coronavirus and that's going to be the chloroquine category and I'll get to your question and then the nearest one's the one that we could do now fluorescent antibody therapy which I've been pushing very hard on because I think we can actually have it going that right now so let's do the let's do the chloroquine hydroxychloroquine that's one of the repurposed ones that's not the lowest hanging fruit with the next lowest paying through this is a medicine that use for malaria it's an anti-malarial drug spin around for decades and check the World Health Organization was going to head in the 90s he's proposed in elimination strategy for malaria to treat everybody with chloroquine until we have chloroquine resistance in that derailed that but it didn't in some parts of the world that still works as an anti-malarial drug is also used as an anti-inflammatory drug for the treatment of lupus and other autoimmune diseases you can make a bucket of it it's cheap we know the safety profile we know can cause arrhythmias and some patient other toxicities but it is generally has a pretty profile we know that the truck and block the replication of the virus in the test tube so in Hibbets the virus in the end will be called in vitro in the test tube II we know this drug reduces inflammation and that's nice because one of the things you get with covid-19 pneumonia is not only get the virus infection in the lawn you got a lot of inflammation so checks a couple of boxes and attracted to look at it and then and then a colleague of mine is a fascinating guy I really appreciate his work as a scientist it was a very serious scientist in Marseille in France and Didier Raul and he's must have published two or three dozen papers in the journal that I found to call plus neglected tropical diseases serious scientist on all sorts of intracellular bacteria that kind of thing covid patience and what he did was he combined hydroxychloroquine with the Z-Pak Azithromycin drug and found found that there's an effect the promise was a very tiny study and so people put those three things together and all of a sudden said we've got the miracle cure I'm not sure that's going to turn out to be really need to do large studies to show that it really works and the reason I'm holding back is you know nothing to do with doctor Professor you know really important scientist that's a small study we were there about a decade ago with influenza that this hydroxychloroquine also inhibited the influenza virus in the test tube but then it didn't pan out in Clinton larger clinical studies so I think we have to be really careful and don't be too quick to to say okay this is this is going to be a time when we're not even close to that yet but we'll know are clinical trials looking at that medicine therapy and it was known for over a hundred years and it was really scaled up during the 1918 influenza pandemic pandemic that killed hundreds tens of millions of people it was shown that if you took individuals had one who had recovered from the disease who he got infected they survived than antibodies in their blood you could remove their blood in some cases give them back their red cells and take the plasma component and use that as a therapy to treat patients and and in fact during the 2003 SARS epidemic the first star starts one there's been a number of studies showing that it worked it actually you could treat patients for it especially if you gave it early on in the course of the infection if you waited too long then it didn't have nearly the same benefit be given orally on the course of infection it could prevent more serious infection and even death because you're actually giving back antibodies antibodies won't last forever but enough to help you survive the infection so a good friend and colleague for a longtime Arturo Sandoval brilliant Professor microbiology at Johns Hopkins you know started talking to me about you know Peter maybe we should be doing this for covid-19 and and as the number started going up I said I called him I said luck Tortura I'm going on CNN tomorrow I think this is an opportunity to tell people about this so I you know help amplify what he was doing paper I wouldn't with a colleague on different Johns Hopkins at least have her own angle her name for Bosque Albert Einstein and I talked to him about this race specific issues to get people to care about about certain things and I and I used it for this purpose and now his colleagues are doing together with the FDA so there's a branch of the Food and Drug Administration called sieber the center for biologics evaluation research which is this a man in a lot of bad things about the FDA all these brilliant scientist vaccines and biologic with Peter marks and he's teamed up with with Arturo to get Network together going over at least 120 academic Health Centers so that they're identifying patients who recovered taking their blood giving them back the red cells collecting the plasma so that when people come in sick they can give treatment in they'll have some clinical trial results I hope in the next few weeks but I'm really optimistic about that 144 saving lives First Responders that's prevented from getting sick cuz you're here I mean I don't know the percentage. First Responders on York and that's why they turned the Empire State Building into a siren last night and into a Johan are all of the all of the First Responders have gotten sick we know this was going to happen maybe this could help them so I think that's going to be really important as well that they're they're having some good results with that are people currently using that in the United States are doctors prescribing that was seated off label use meaning that is not an improved indication but they're going ahead and use it and you know I just maybe it'll turn out to be a good treatment but the evidence is is not strong the there's a study in Shanghai that suggested it didn't work so we really need Well Control trial you really need to spend on the dose because maybe it's a dosing they maybe if you give too high or too low a dose not going to work how you pair it with the Zithromax so it's going to take a little bit of time to work out in this is the frustration that people have you seen my God we have this terrible pandemic now we need to get these new therapies and vaccines are very quickly it's the hardest thing to do it's the hardest thing to do is to accelerate new technologies for a new virus we've never seen before while the epidemic is Raging while the pandemic is Raising its we don't have a lot of track record doing this we did it once with ebola if you remember in 2014 there was a terrible Ebola epidemic in West Africa affected 33,000 people eleven thousand people died that was in Guinea Liberian Sierra Leone and there was some initial vaccine trials started by that looks pretty promising Dad license to technology from the Canadiens the script in Manitoba a public health Canada and it looks promising but as the tribes got underway what happened was there was an international response to put in a health system because it turns out he bowl is not very transmissible you just have to have some healthcare infrastructure make certain that you're not directly handling the the corpse of someone who has recently died from from Ebola virus infection India and we even send in the hundred first Airborne Division we said in the The Screaming Eagle switch made a big impact on helping to let you know save West Africa from this infection so the WHIO came in there was there was a Doctors Without Borders Africa and so the vaccine never really got fully tested but then five years later when there was the terrible epidemic a Democratic Republic of Congo that's when the vaccine really came into widespread use and it's probably one of the most important Public Health stories never told which was under conditions of terrible conflict and War and political strife and civil Civil War they vaccinated 200,000 people with this vaccine and it largely help eliminate Ebola from Democratic Republic of Congo in that in that during those hostilities last last year and essentially saved I think it's help to stabilize the whole African continent so it's an amazing story and it was this multilateral effort that involved also US government we really should help stabilize sub-Saharan Africa will look at the time frame 2014 first epidemic the 2019 that's fine that's 5 years that's a more realistic time frame for a vaccine just to give people a sense of perspective</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> talk about Germany because I found that really fascinating when I was reading on Germany and their low mortality rate the tribute that too is that the well diagnosis covid-19 of died Which is higher than just about anywhere else I think what's happened there is when the health system gets so overwhelmed that so many so that another words of transmission goes on for a long time and you haven't picked it up and then all the sudden people start showing up in the ICU then it's too late then you start having massive numbers of people coming to the ICU the hospital can't take care of everybody they can intubate everyone they can't give everyone to the highest quality Care possible snowfall to the doctors and nurses their Heroes but the fact that they're completely overwhelmed with patient that's when we're tality starts to to Really rise so we saw this and parts of Wuhan and we saw this in Italy and that was a big worry about New York that the same thing would happen to New York hold that thought for a second in Germany so far getting it and the fact that the hospital system was getting ready and they've got that infrastructure in place to manage that surged although they're worried not to that it it may start going up in OverWatch people not large numbers of people getting infected number one or overwhelm the health system just like in Italy so there is sew-in in New Orleans right now the case fatality rate is between 4 and 5 but there's another Factor go on in New Orleans lots of people living in extreme poverty and poverty is very linked to diabetes and hypertension and we know diabetes and hypertension is a big risk factor for death so this is getting hit twice systems getting overwhelmed I think you have a lot of African Americans living in poverty was underlined diabetes and hypertension and that's causing that to the Skyrocket so you know I was just on the phone today with the leadership of Houston and saying you know you know we have a similar demographic to New Orleans and we're sister cities after Katrina and a linked at the hip and and you know there are sister city we love them but you know we have to recognize that even if we hit can handle the surge Medical Center we still have that demographic of African-Americans Hispanics with underlying diabetes and hypertension I'm really worried we're going to see high mortality in Texas Princeton Chinese older Chinese men and really high mortality rates and here's something very interesting smoking actually upregulates the receptor in the lungs that the buyer signs to so it seems to make more copies of the receptor for the virus to bind to so that may worsen the disease so I think you're right I think smoking is a factor the one question that we don't know is what is vaping do does is vaping also could that be linked somehow to the young and all the young adults that we're seeing in the United States who are getting hospitalized and their lives are being saved because they're being intubated and put on the vent but is there a vaping connection again new question we don't know it's something that's going to have to be looked up one of the reasons one of many reasons why I'm so thankful for you for coming on the podcast and and trying to educate us on this thing with my 20-year science partner dr. Maryland up Itachi we're trying that we've we develop vaccines including coronavirus vaccine or try to get those out the door in clinical trials in between I'm going on Fox News MSNBC and CNN that's not an easy need needle to thread either going and Fox News Ms MSNBC and CNN that's been really interesting but I love the opportunity and and I'm trying to get accurate information explaining trying to get accurate information also explaining the science behind but sometimes you hear something that doesn't sound right and it sometimes takes a couple of minutes to to explain that and and those three cable news networks have been great about giving me some time to to explain the thinking behind it which they ordinarily wouldn't do</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> let's look going taking it from the top let's let's discuss give us your take on how we got here because this is It's been a very strange obviously the president completely miscalculated what was going to happen in the way he was explaining to the news he was kind of saying that it was just a few cases and they'll be gone and now obviously New York City shut down the entire country is separated from each other everybody is isolating at home give us your take on how we got here will let you know that the truth is we knew this was coming or something like it we had a heads-up and then didn't even even a heads up before last year because this is now our third major coronavirus disaster of the 21st century we had what's called star severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 that started in China and caused the terrible epidemic in Toronto and actually took the the roll songs to do a concert to bring the economy back to Toronto in 2003 and then it was mayor's coronavirus infection in 2012 and this is the third one so we actually you realize that's coronavirus is we're going to be coming me sing and we embarked on a big run a virus vaccine program a decade ago and each time that cause devastating Hospital epidemic affected healthcare worker so the point is this sung fortunately is becoming for the globe is terrible coronavirus epidemics and we saw this one coming up in the end of 2019 in China and I knew we were in for trouble because that's what coronavirus is do that we were going to be in trouble because Cars 2 so the massage one then there's than stars to so both stars 1 and mirrors made you so sick and that such a high case-fatality rate that anybody who got it was almost immediately hospitalized and basically out of the community that the difference with this one ironically is it is it's pretty lethal it's about five to ten times more lethal than regular flu seasonal flu but also there's a big group of people who get very sick at all and so you have this should have perfect mix where it's not the most lethal infection we've ever seen if not the most transmissible infection we've ever seen but it's high enough and both categories that are combined in this very toxic waste so what you have is you have a group of people who are getting very sick or in the Intensive Care Unit like older people those with diabetes and hypertension even a group of younger people who are getting it very sick set a larger group who only getting mildly sick who can still walk around the community and be out in about and stores and restaurants and infecting everybody and so this is what caused the problem it's a it's highly transmissible has a big group of people walking around spreading it and a smaller subset but a big sub said we're getting very sick and even dying in the Intensive Care Unit in New York City right now for asymptomatic we don't we really don't there's a rough correlation page so younger people seem to do better and actually kids seem to do really well with this infection they don't they do get with it with one exception that I'll tell you about the minute most kids don't get very sick at all but they're helping with the community spread and we don't quite know why I also it but something is very important one of the reasons why I really want you to come on and talk to you about Coke is there's this Buzz out there in the community that it's only old people that are getting sick and dying and going to ice use but in fact the Centers for Disease Control came up with this very chilling document a few weeks ago showing that about a third of the very sick people in the hospital are under the age of 40 or 44 so between 20 and 40 for young adults are getting very sick and that word has not gotten out adequate because when in fact disinfection first appeared in central China it was all about older individuals over the age of 70 those with diabetes and hypertension and we didn't hear about the young adults but then for reasons that we don't understand we saw this big group in Italy and France Spain of younger adults and we're seeing that play out in the US and I know it on the people who you know listen to you and watch you that's a big group between that age of 20 and 44 and they really need to hear that they are for severe illness despite what they might have heard previously and then flew back got sick and here's what's really maybe you could help me with this he said he was feeling terrible and then took Advil and it got exponentially worse is that coincidental do you think I mean there's has been talks of avoiding ibuprofen Michael's 45 years old very healthy very robust guy so when he was I mean he was in the hospital for a week and his words were I almost died and he was really really concerned what what about what about an ibuprofen so there's been a lot of buzz on the internet about ibuprofen and then the World Health Organization came out with a statement saying those are rumors so there's not a lot of evidence to say that you get worse with ibuprofen probably he was just one of those young adults that's going to get very sick and that's what this virus does it has the ability to get deep into the pulmonary system in your lungs binds to receptors on the cells of your lungs and causes a terrible pneumonia and on top of it you get a big inflammatory response so it really so severe pneumonia ability to breathe and that's why so many people who are getting really sick of this virus have to go on respirators so is that there's a rumor that you shouldn't take Ibuprofen but is that unfounded are you advising people take Ibuprofen do you think they should just avoid it just in case and where did this rumor start from and what what is the concern as I've done and then you've got the problem you know some people how to say don't take Aspirin because if this is a respiratory virus infection there could be a severe reaction with with aspirin as well so for now today I might look like the biggest idiot in the world tomorrow or next week and that's because this is a brand-new virus and we've never seen before right so we're on a steep learning curve so we're learning new things about this virus every day so that's why you know how many things are going to say today might sound like I'm waffling or hedging it's it's because I am where we were learning so much that's new about this virus so it's really important that everybody be really Mindful and pay attention to real health information that dad from accurate sources because things move things change as we learn more about this is a virus that we didn't even know existed about 4 months ago and we've learned about an incredible. I'm the Chinese put up a lot of information on these preprint server is about what the virus is what the sequence is the genetic code with the receptor binds to when we had the original salt that we call this new Once ours to the covid-19 so the covid-19 the virus is called stars to SARS coronavirus to when we had the original Stars won how much so much for learning right now I'm so glad you brought that up cuz that is really important for people to understand people that maybe haven't looked into the complications that are involved in trying to recognize treatments and cures for a virus that it is it's you everyone's learning and and things can change depending on does not just the passage and it's also what we called the host the person to so the fact you know that the virus affected young adults in Europe in the u.s. in a way that did not necessarily occur in China is important and so we are kiwi and then who knows what happens when the virus goes into Latin America or India are sub-Saharan Africa just waiting for well that's one of the issues that people are having in terms of blood type there's there's all this talk of certain blood types may be more susceptible to the virus protector Lee blood type a Twitter I think a week or so ago there's dozens of different pathogens with including viruses and bacteria that behave differently depending I mean there's a whole I put one up on Twitter I think a week or so ago there's dozens of different pathogens with including viruses and bacteria that behave differently depending on a person's blood type so host genetics influence quite a bit</div>

Supposed to double your right hand or left hand I don't like that right like I like a hose off of it to Eastside industrial strength around if you had that s*** on your eyebrow hairs but your eyebrow hairs how much rubbing this one left one the right what the f*** dude look at that I like that you tried out that warm water on your but I guess it's a smaller little thing that I remembered say don't think you have to worry though the day is a bidet on their side the room to look if you see they're over there that's a good day so there was a bit dicey that's what I'm talking about I was super confused sing the pokes out in the middle and that's kind of what I was talking about and some of them are a little bit higher than others but they're these weird little I don't know what kind of ships are these people take a little earlier</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> the guy that they just arrested for selling the coronavirus pill that is supposedly kills the coronavirus he reminds me of that old bodybuilding guy with it Dan or whatever that used to sell fake chloroquine there's no studies right there's no definitive test but they're still letting people try is that what's going on with that take so that the couple that died took the wrong shed picture of trump is getting in the way of the accuracy of some people's reporting of the news and that's a perfect example like resorting to clickbait and saying that they heard it from Trump but he does now he said what he was talking about a different kind of chloroquine there's more than one different kind of it right right but if they just said real simply that these people die please be careful there is more than one different kind of chloroquine and Queen hasn't been shown definitively to work yet and it's not necessarily safe to take if they said that they would be great but instead they had to say the president told people to take it that's not what he said what he said is that there's hope and we're hoping that this could be a cure or this could be a treatment what he said but that's what everybody's saying like if you go and read articles about that when doctors were talking about potential treatment there's a bunch of different ones there's IV vitamins is chloroquine there's this corquin which is like an old-school malaria medication and then zpacks for talked about what is that called Death from Mathis in how do you say that time for talking about what doctors are talking about because legitimate people are talking about that combination of things but just cuz you hate Trump you can't distort this and make it seem like Trump did something irresponsible by talking about this hopeful disease medication and these people took the wrong version of it and died but this a cautionary tale it's not a chance to s*** on Trump but everything's a chance to s*** on Trump it's so exhausting it's just it's it's f****** weird let me see movie ratings but he's gotten a lot better at handling confrontational conversations with reporters you know I was watching this one yesterday and this reporter was asking a question about a few things but she asked about people dying because of the economy failing and him talking about like an is there anyone that could speak to he says it's in this playing a game the game is she knows there's no real data that shows if they do that this will happen if the economy crashes the way they anticipated crashing all these people are out of work for an extended. Of time x amount of people kill themselves but we for sure know that economic despair is is a reason why some people go into depression depression is a reason why some people kill themselves these are all facts that we all know like maybe you can't pull that out of your ass you're standing in front of a Podium and you're addressing vehicle and they're calling you out on this and what you was saying correctly is we can't put money ahead of people's lives so the correct Thing by most people's account is for at least some. Of time separating everybody maintaining this this distance and putting a stop to the the number of viruses remember people to get infected he saying is there's also a factor that we have to consider that all these people out of work could lead to suicide and could lead to drug addiction and he's right and you know he's right we all know he's right that's not that's irrefutable When people's lives fall apart through the unexpected circumstances some people are hanging on by a f****** thread and that comes along and it doesn't matter that does happen if people we all know that to be true just cuz you hate Trump you can't pretend that this isn't going to be rough people or you can't pretend at him saying that this can cause a loss of life to I think the problem might have been he might have said maybe more life there's no evidence that that's true there's no evidence that it might cause more loss of life I think also we grew up always listening when a stressful time when the president came on you feel comforted like his tone of voice how he how he acted you're just like a a a book</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> this virus I've been saying this about all viruses that diseases are demons you know and we we just if we were losing like have you seen the numbers to this is something that my friend Steve who's a doctor sent me and this is a f****** create a series of crazy statistics but the crazy statistics about how many people died like it puts it into perspective all life lost is valuable all I've lost is a try I'm not saying anything other than that but what I'm just I'm not diminishing anyone's loss of life or what I am saying is I was stunned when I saw the actual numbers so 2017 to 2-2-2018 h2n 3 pandemic killed sixty-one thousand Americans did you know that I didn't know that did you do that 17 to 2018 hospitalized 3453 in estimated affected was 894700 people buy that flu that's crazy overall death rate was 7.5 with a peak in January 2018 of 10.8 again I'm a moron not a doctor reading you a text message maybe I shouldn't be doing that maybe someone should look into this 2009 pandemic know this is the one that Burt said he had the H1 N1 that killed 80 3300 Americans death rates range from 4% to 33% for Pediatric 0 to 22% for 18 and 6402 4% for those over 65 man this is crazy u.s. case is 68274000 hospitalized 12469 deaths in the u.s. I'm just going over all these different ones that happened flu the year 2020 cases reported 45:9 Hospital hospitalizations 4 and fifteen thousand deaths 48,000 that's for the 2020 flu this flu season there's so many people that died of the flu but obviously this when you see healthcare workers freaking out you know this is different so what is different about it that's yeah it's all the same time it's new it's a new virus people don't then I have immunity for it they don't really know how to cure it and attacks the respiratory system and it seems to have a real quick turnaround from I'm not feeling so good to I'm dead you know it's happens very quickly for some people shockingly so some of these seems to affect different people in different ways but there's a lot going on with this one that has smart people going we need to f****** stay home for a bit just everybody chill no large Gatherings she'll get the flu shot every year I mean like I feel like I get the flu almost every year but I sleep well and I've been able to shake it off but it's a good move it's probably I probably should get the flu shot and if I got the flu again maybe I'd like f*** man I should have got the flu shot let me get the flu shot but mean whether it's diet or whether it's some all that s*** I'm on all the different vitamins and hormones and the fact that I'm in the f****** sauna for 25 minutes everyday but I rarely get sick if you make you would get it more just because you're around like you know Jim's and saunas in my places where there's a lot of sweating play cooties I've gotten in the gym it scare me is staph a couple of times that scares me to get ringworm times I got that twice at least maybe three times which is not that bad you put Lamisil on it stay out the mat for a little bit and then the products are start using prevented or save me from that company called defense soap good bacteria it just coats your body with this soap and it's all like natural it it it kills the bad bacteria but it doesn't kill good bacteria I don't understand how that works both people have known that forever the tea tree oil and eucalyptus oil good for infections and preventing infection chords yeah I've been I've been lucky with diseases knock on wood but it's you know this is a weird one if you're if you're compromised you know people that have lung issues or people that have had like even vaping yeah I think cigarettes and vaping and that also affects so many people like that list that I read off is that right I should I read right we think it seems like those numbers correct numbers again so what did I say was start off with the first one the first one was Michael you apparently put out a video today. JD he's back okay let's look at this one the 2017 to 2018 H2 N3 virus pandemic killed 61,000 American that up the hardest part with that right now is those numbers have been accumulated over a year plus and we only have had a month forever today 61000 people now the other one was the big one at the end the flu for this year for 2020 cases reported 45 million hospitalizations 415000 deaths 48,000 cuz it happens every right you know it's like the sky monster of the sky monster never appeared before and then one day the first tornado hit and tore apart Nashville we be like what in the f*** is God's mad at us right that's how I used to feel back in this just one person's case I remember last week I read someone that got tested for the flu and I tested positive and then weeks later got tested for the covid-19 and then tested positive for that but they weren't tested for the time they're tested for the flu because they don't have a test tested positive for the flu maybe that never had a covid-19 test could be available good bacon I'm testing positive is it mean could they ride that got some hand sanitizer before the Green in San Diego and Tom Green was the first person that I knew that was kind of like panicking a little that he just bought a crate of Lysol many Lysol and he was spraying the microphone down on stage and like and I was like he's taking a little overboard literally like a week later everyone's doing that f*** it's a bit spooky dude who was it that had a friend was it Tom Papa was friend was warning him long in advance no wasn't Tom Papa it was Bert Kreischer Bert Kreischer at a friend who's warning him Wayne Advance listen and you need to isolate need to get your family and he was like like what in this is apparently in February he's like this lady's crazy now and then he texted her like the beginning of March one of those on and Poppin he's like you're right my point about us showing those numbers is not to diminish the impact of this current pandemic it was just to highlight the fact that we live in a warzone we Livin of a virus Warzone that takes out thousands of people every year in this country and I don't most of us are really keeping our eye on that you know what you hear about deaths by the flu and the Never Say Never shocking death by some new thing for some reason even if it's the same number of deaths or less even right so far less freaked us the f*** out it's like it's happening more everyday like this that guy died of flu a total of 19543 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations were reported by flu serve – net sites between October 2019 and March 21-2024 t1100 72.1% were associated with influenza A virus what's 14000 what I say whoops I want my dyslectic influenza okay 5335 27.3% with influenza B that's true to write if you get an influenza A shot and its influenza B you might catch it anyway that's annoying so that's a lot of people so we got 19505 thousand 304,000 14100 my theory is Warren sucking your thumb your supposed to suck your thumb your whole life and it was supposed to keep your immune system strong so that it was vital to the hospital station rate was 67.3% 467.3 per 100,000 population Which is higher than all recent Seasons except for the 2017-2018 season rates in children 0 to 4 years old in adults 18-49 are now the highest CDC has on record for these age groups of pass the rate reported during the 2009 H1 N1 pandemic hospitalization rates for school-age children are higher than any recent regular-season but lower than rates during the pandemic when they killed all those people they didn't shut anything down he had the H1 N1 he did yeah you did yeah he has never in his life and it was 2009 when it was all going down and he said he couldn't sleep you so uncomfortable in just constant pain and aching should never never felt sick or ever in his life and that killed a lot of people I got a flu like that before 5 years ago or something like that can get you they can get you I hope another thing that comes out of here is people take their f****** immune system more seriously support your immune system you know I mean it just makes a bit just a little shift in the number of people that get healthy little ship the number number of people to start taking vitamins and exercising and you know just do something man's something put a heavy backpack on go for a walk do something listen to podcast system you know I mean it just makes a bit just a little shift in the number of people that get healthy little ship the number number of people to start taking vitamins and exercising and you know just do something man's something put a heavy backpack on go for a walk do something listen to podcast</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> well that's the other things going on with people's the fear man when you have a hard time dealing with anxiety you have apprehension you just fearful of the future and fearful to disease some people have anxiety before this this can accelerate everything that's going to be real hard for just for mental health the people sit going to be people they're going to have a really hard time also accepting this is just something that happened to them it says something that they did wrong you know when something goes bad and you did something wrong account like I made a bad decision and I should have done that way I f***** up and we should have had that meeting and then you know you might know why your business fell apart but if it falls apart now but you didn't even do anything wrong and the government gets to tell you they have to sit back now if you were conspiracy theorist it's so many of them you would think will be the best way to gain more control the people the best way first Vault accelerate the spare and accelerate unemployment you do all the things that are just going to happen from what naturally happens in a diseased people are willing to give up certain civil liberties if they if they think they can get more safety and it's true we should stay home it's true it will be better for everybody it's true that we need to take precautions it's true that we need to self isolate all those things but it's also true that you're giving a certain amount of power to the government to lock things down and control you they giving people tickets in New York they catch them walking around again $500 tickets they're doing another place just to I'm sure and that's where it gets weird man because it's who are these people these people that are telling you can't go anywhere they're just the government they're just people there people telling people that they can't go somewhere which is fine if we need to do that like right now but what if it just sort of stays that way what if it stays that way to a lesser extent what they saw you know how it going to stop coronavirus from really taking place I want to know where you going I want to know where you going I want to know I want when you go through each state we're going to have checkpoints going to pull you over its give you height and police day so if you've been tested for the coronavirus and you put a f****** thing on your forehead what if what if this thing really does start coming back the way it 4 people tested negative and then they later tested positive is that happens here and we going to keep this lockdown thing going on with if it's something that we all have it comes back like when Jon Jones had those steroids in his system in the Pica grams and it just kept flashing back and with us with this stuff what we test positive for Coronavirus every couple years but if it's like herpes but if you keep it for life what for assuming we got rid of it we can just accept martial law we just make sense tanks in the streets except it's a question so if you were a nut right now you would be f****** going crazy because you would be saying all the pieces are in place for like a hostile takeover and they're in place because they really truly are the best ways to save people's lives like it's all so smart thing to do but if you are conspiracy theorists you said this is exactly what I would do if I wanted to take over and that's why we have to be really careful of we got to be careful of Summer walking that very fine balance of protecting people from a disease is Invisible Killer and preserving our freedom and preserving rights all those things are very important we don't just give that up cuz it's it's not the way to go it's just not we have to figure out our way through this disease and then we have to figure out some way to return to normalcy and that's got to happen we can't just stay like this where no one works anymore we can't just not ever take risks we can't just not go out so once this does get rolling again it's going to be real interesting to see how much if any control the government retains how much of that if any restrictions get get imposed how much of these restrictions we just absorbing to become new or new things I got a normal thing rather we're just go to the airport you have to take a temperature test and go to the airport they want to test you or would I have to start wearing suits like Star Wars breathing apparatus and everyone that works at the grocery store is going to be robots you know and pathogen that you get to the hotel and unzip you can enjoy New York City from your balcony look so pretty out there with all the murderous viruses swarming around killing people with the virus get together made bars tornadoes start just throwing people against walls or virus babies make it fly through the air like we seen why can't a virus tornado to slam you into a wall viruses accelerate billions of times and they've they form colonies and they become intelligent and they realized they move quick enough they can actually like they could knock you off your feet and they go down your throat like a demon just what we're reading about the H1 N1 all these other flus a kill so many countless thousands of people that can be counted them pretty accurate way to double-check just think about that the sheer numbers of people that died from those things if those were demons instead of diseases how freaky would that be if we're really look we're going to lose a certain amount of people every year to Demons little cut still little Godzilla just running up into your window and killing your grandma then a virus the silent thing choke you to death I need to know I've been thinking that all the world needs to get to come together is like that alien invasion he figured it out what if this did come from space like this takeover of the World by another Nation what better way to do it than that but if North Korea was behind all this resources likely that's beside the point I don't think it was intentional things like this happen people do take advantage of opportunity and you got to be real careful who gets the better hand and they take advantage of it's just it's an underground weird for people they know where it came from they think they've isolated that this thing did come from this Market in Wuhan they know it's just it's the way things like this can play out there's a bunch of these is almost just like someone starting a conspiracy it's not it doesn't have to be done like it just actually naturally this in the same people that would benefit from a conspiracy or who would Engage The Conspiracy to defraud people are f***** people over in the first place was going to jump in and take advantage of the quickest That's What's So Scary About It totalitarian ideas Thrive when people are scared they want someone to take over the reins they want someone to take over will block the streets No More Travel going to block this you can't go to work and I'm going to be poor and broke it scared I'm not saying what I am saying do something to really take over civilization it would be this way that's how you would do it you would do diseases I'm not saying they're doing that I don't think they are I think this is just a horrible natural disaster really clear on that but we might come out of this different than we went in that's real just tanks driving down the road in California thanks getting supplies or something like what he sent me a video from his phone of Tanks rolling down New York City armed Humvees and tanks freaky like military vehicles and Camo we hiding your New York City from with some camo is that even when they use them in cities they Camelot like to let you know they might hide in the bushes to b**** the drive to the city's to lock everybody down to had those murdered out matte black paint job that it would be a little more intimidating me pieces of pizza slices and stuff and you're not in the military have an eye on you anyway what are you doing right military style Hummer around like please check that guy's house you know please please read his Facebook please you just got to give up a microchip they put a microchip in your hand and your fine and it's also doubles as a Corona tester so you make sure that you had never get mistaken for someone Corona just have to scan you how you going to the bathroom to have your hand please with peace and harmony I mean really I'm trying not to sound like a conspiracy nut cuz I'm not accusing anyone of creating conspiracy what I am saying is if if I was a conspiracy not or if I was a country that was conspiring to take over the world this is not a bad way to do it I don't think that's happening right now I want to be real clear but it's kind of the same result that were experiencing right now we're ones being forced to shut down with who-knows-what consequences it's also the right thing to do so we're all like whoa you know it's another one of those things about being a person or the right thing to do still feels crazy still feels like encouraging is so many people are willing to stay home and people aren't rebelling like f*** you this is my country I'm going to work I'll take a chance he's going to get it anyway f*** you people doing that when you consider that the government is controlling 320 million people pretty crazy almost everyone's complying with staying home is only a few essential businesses and we're going to have to think really have spacesuits to leave the house and work Scooby a mess are you worried Jamie I've never seen you this word everything I look into the future to see where we're headed and I don't see a really see much out there cuz I don't know where it is but it's not anything good cuz there's nothing like going to the movies again seems like that's probably close to out movies were already dying anyway house for twenty bucks perfect way better sweet so when are movie theaters open again all right what's next concerts sporting events I don't know once everything's in place where they can treat people effectively and they have the adequate number of ventilators then are we going to go back to the way things were or we going to have new standards in place I don't know man that they look they did an unprecedented thing they lock down the entire country to save people's lives never happened before we're in New Territory and you know it's dangerous when a moron like me is making sense but when I'm one of the people talking about something like this when he was living in France and I don't know who is writing to I'll try to find the right now but he's talking about how they stocked up on a bunch of alcohol and people were being told it's almost like you're told not to go anywhere but some people don't believe it. He was talking about a writer friend of his who wasn't taking it seriously and like it was like real people Ryan and everyone's just like what's going on you got to read the newspaper like f*** what happened it's fake what a good way to end what happened it's fake how they get you I just saw that this was going viral during the pandemic and why people have been falling for it and son of a b**** what a good way to end</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you know you look at I don't know if you've been paying attention to what these Senators did but there's some Senators they had a behind-closed-doors meeting about the coronavirus in China and what it means United States and you know the various impacts and they went out sold their stock immediately and then they were talking about how under control the government had it and how we're prepared and how it's going to be fine and meanwhile they knew they knew so they had two faces that a public face and they're given to us to try to keep us calm and then they had a private face which realize that the stock market was going to take a huge loss until they sold everything and made amends profits based on the information that they found out he's closed-door meetings about the coronavirus how are they supposed to know about legal supposed to do using that works like if you like what is the point of playing the stock market if you don't know things and if you do know things would you no more because you know the guy was a president tells you something about something to do and you're not supposed to trade then because of that information like alright okay I'm sure there's a logic to it don't run it by me but if that's what is it with the Senators do if they knew that the coronavirus is going to wreck our economy if they knew that it was coming like a f****** storm of hail that no one could stop if they knew and then they bailed out and made demands profits that seem so shady that they didn't advise but you're supposed to be a leader right if you're in a position of an elected representative you're supposed to be acting in the position of a leader and if your way to lead is tell people one thing but act in a completely different direction tell people everything's going to be fine but then start selling your stock prophet and you don't tell other people to do it because you're worried that maybe that information is going to cause some ripple effect is going to destroy the economy even before the coronavirus hits just had a panic and fear in people going to act wrong but you acted in a different way than the way you were talking you acted like this s*** was going to be real you act like there's going to be a real problem and then the question is like how much of a problem did they think was going to be maybe they dump the stock that. I was going to be a little problem would that be okay but if they found I was going to be huge comments not well that seems weird to me too like I don't know what the should the rules be with information in the stock market stock market is gross like it's what the whole things grow this f****** Madness so I saw an article where the photographer who took that photo was like he was like oh it's so sad that people are using his image that way because you know he pass play in and I thought it was kind of offensive that he was being used to prank or whatever and he said you know I saw the people started selling merch what this guy's face on it and he goes I just wish because I own the photograph and I'm not trying to come after you when I just wish they would share proceeds of that merch with the family so I saw that and I was like oh I want to do that so I launched a shirt with that guy's face on it that says wash your hands and then and then I go I go I want to give the proceeds to this Man's family so because of that article I reached out to people I was able to get in touch with the photographer the guy who took that picture and then I found I got in touch with his the the the models fiance who you know anyways I contacted her I found her I've learned a little bit about this guy in that photo and I'm giving them the proceeds from the shirt sales all of them all the profits will go to them and I also found that when he when he died like the family wasn't prepared like financially for anything so they had set up a GoFundMe for his funeral and Tombstone and all that so I'm going to blast it out but I talk to him either they're happy with it so that's my breaking news important news not really as big I didn't get into that with her mommy said that it's photoshopped I've heard that as well show me the original black dick I didn't even know this was a thing I think so how many dead husband LOL yeah so anyways yeah oh well bucks you can get more than that they make much money but we've never been in a situation where everybody scared of one disease it's so strange man it's so strange I don't think I'd be able to get past that and just do a show right now I'm 90% sure they're going to cancel it mean that the stuff that they're coming up with for treatment one of them is a malarial disease and old malaria disease or some other different treatments that hold hope and but there's so many old man that we could get infected if you got to show 12013 thousand people whatever it is how the f*** are you going to make sure those people are okay is that your responsibility do you say, at your own risk you know I mean what have you get it when you're there or what are we doing what are we doing you know I mean the whole thing's crazy hopefully unless this is the first thing that falls and then all those other things fall into place we talked about natural disasters appreciate piece we can appreciate freedom and appreciate being a roam around do whatever you want go out at 3 at night you going to be going to appreciate it you can appreciate being able to go to a diner and have breakfast with your friend at 2 in the morning laugh un appreciate it cars in the street everybody acting normal going to mean more to you now it's like the sun after I need a means more feels better has more of an impact and I think we've gone through a long stretch in this country where everything was static everything was doing fairly well we're on an upward Trend no real tragedy National nationally to change the way we live our life other than September 11th so we got like September 11th and then all these years of war of course crime of course always a but we're basically business as usual for most folks not anymore call the wake-up call that you have a finite amount of time in this life and this life the way you're experiencing it right now it's just how it is right now there's a million different factors that are in Play constantly and you've been real lucky they've out of the stretch of peace and Harmony but that s*** could change at any moment it really could and we got to use this time to be nicer to each other little use this time to to realize that we got we got a little confused we got crazy you know everybody trying to acquire things and everybody's trying to tell you to move their way up the corporate ladder like hey there's there's a f****** end of this ride okay this ride comes to a stop someday and he doesn't matter how much s*** you've acquired it doesn't matter you know how far you got up this ladder you know what what position of prominence you have in the community and how you're respected by the business World nobody gives a f*** when your dad it's not you're going to die we are together right now experiencing this thing in like really distracted way the thing comes into focus when you're forced into a situation like like we are now where you literally or nervous about your survival then nothing comes into focus and he only brought in tools to make tools and the big tools like that he made all of them self and amazing at home and stuff that you would know he would

This virus doesn't give a f*** and if you don't respect it people are going to die and there's people like the lieutenant governor I think is who he is of Texas who is like we should take a risk with older people just to get the economy back in line people like whoa what are you saying you think they're kind of you should we should get the economy back in line and bite do any kind of some old people going to have to die you're ready to sacrifice people for money older people would rather die than let covid-19 harm US economy Texas official said older people would rather die that's what he says Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick okay yeah and you know you saying that he's in that high-risk category himself cuz he's 70 you notice these politicians are terrified that this is going to lead to an economic disaster and their names going to be stuck on it you know I think they were terrified at first that they had they had to act that a close things down they didn't have a plan and now they realize like oh my God this might have to stay locked down for a long time what happens you, yeah you didn't have a plan so they locked down and now they're like listen this could last a long time we got to take we got to start the Rumblings now I'm getting this ball rolling again because if it's go 6-7 months and no one's working no one can go outside their house or six seven months like this is crazy what we won't have any money and China going to take over Tucker Carlson at his whole piece he did that I saw there was actually pretty accurate and where he's talking about what what could be possible do you like he was talking about how the NBA what did you see that whole segment where the NBA they had said something about China and then then you see all these people that were praised in China and saying positive things about China what was this what was the reason behind that Jamie your MBA guy the GM for the Houston Rockets tweeted like support for Hong Kong that's right that's right and then trying to get pissed at that until then they started tweeting nice things about China and they started at the time of that happened that there was like an NBA teams in China doing games and then just come back and then they start asking all them what they thought about this and then like the bronze started supporting China I think and then everyone jumped on them and money over people I think you mean that they face consequences for supporting Hong Kong yeah well would talk across from the saying in this piece was that imagine if that's the the whole country like understand that like a China's the ruler of the world of China becomes the ruler of the world not the United States because of something like this like this is all really possible like the idea that the United States is the ruler of the world so it has to stay the ruler of the world forever no natural disasters disease f****** asteroid impact has a bunch of different things that could shift the balance of power in the world ROM used to run everything right do you know that there's a European England UK English to run to have the f****** planet there's a lot of different countries that were on top of the world that are no longer on top of the world and we would be in a real sticky situation if we had to live under the same military dictatorship the China does and the idea that we would never have to live under that we we can't wear America but that's ridiculous because we're human beings and other human beings are stuck in a circumstance where they're living under a dictatorship so there's no difference between culture and the place where they live that that ships things change with natural disaster with disease with failure of the economy with war with all these different factors things change and our perception much like our perception of our society itself it's always going to be like this and also this disease comes along and shut everything down you like whoa that's a wake-up call need to recognize that this is kind of fragile is fragile if those things happen natural disaster disease wore anything catastrophic happen if the balance of power completely ship and who knows whose control the survivors are under who knows who knows how this is all real touch-and-go right now this is real touch-and-go this is Uncharted Territory where we have slipped into a place where no

		<div class="paragraph"> so why we should tell everybody what we learned today I'm revising my thinking about this virus because of Michael Yo Michael Yo caught it as healthy as f*** he's he's not he's not in a high-risk group like he's not he doesn't have any pre-existing conditions he's in shape and he got it and he got pneumonia too and he said it was a double combination and he thought he was going to die and he was in the hospital for over a and 4 days ago he said he thought he was going to die that's f****** terrifying cuz Michael Yo is healthy he's not some eighty-year-old man I talked to my friend dr. Peter attia he's a physician and he gets into the swim from Maui yes others Get Wrecked and he said I still think most people blow 55 sale through it I've had two patients get it shity cold and loss of a sense of smell and taste would probably return soon but still a small fraction of these folks get hurt I know it. Taking care of a 28 year old fitness instructor on a ventilator in New York City today why you said maybe some genetic predisposition we know blood types matters a is the worst Bo is best based on antibodies he said I'm O+ he said but I don't think that explains more than some of it maybe s*** like vaping he said still too soon to tell he is a straight-up no-nonsense no bulshit guy and I listen to everything he says so when guys like him are concerned concerned and he's concerned he's weird is he's nothing but he said it's weird that it seems that people spend more time with this get it worse is like it's not like you don't like like doctors and hospitals with prolonged exposure to get it really bad nurses in the hospital with prolonged exposure seem to get it really bad where some people get it and they don't get it bad it's weird it's a very very strange disease according to doctors and I think we're still trying to figure this out you know it's just wow it's it's one of those things where everyone sort of absorbing the information as it comes in and you got to be open to adjusting your opinions my opinions were I really was concerned with old people and I was concerned with sick people now after Michael yeah okay this is not that straightforward there might be some some other crazy factors here is like for some people yeah like Idris Elba who looks fantastic you know fine but maybe other people are going to have a real hard time with it like Michael Yo Sky that's Pokemon I mean your podcast with the foster home chicken little chicken little that scared the f*** out of me and let's go to bed that f****** podcast crazyman osterholm is he predicted this s*** literally specifically as to where was going to come from he was very inside the drink a lot the smoke overweight the drink a lot the smoke who's my one from take care of himself the worst it's you is me</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Joker when the old set it'll probably retired now that we're awful at least a week's man when I mean that it's probably going to be several months before easily could be longer it could be you know maybe they find medication that even though there's not a vaccine there's some hope for a few different kinds of medication one of them is malaria drug and there's enough one that shows promise is well and they think that it might be possible that people could catch this and you'd give them to medication it would wipe it out there's also there was some speculation about Tamiflu but I don't think there's any conclusive evidence that shows a Tamiflu helps it but there is some these antimalarial medications I think that they think has promised but what concerns me is it seems to be so different with different people that's what's weird about this makes it now for everybody's the unknown like we're in the unknown like now we've never been in this situation before as a culture we're at we're on lockdown in the whole world scared of a disease not not in our lifetimes mean not since like the Spanish flu and back then there wasn't as much Transportation there wasn't as much distribution of information to people probably wanted as we're as we are now you know of all the various cases all around them all the time cuz you know we're here in about cases and Italy and f****** Australia everywhere we're hearing about cases all over the planet I think that was the case back during the Spanish food days I think it's probably harder to understand what was happening right because you probably only got the newspaper in the radio back that and everybody has those are the masters of information whatever they said that was it but now you get all sorts of conflicting information from nothing and then I've read doctors that were terrified is like whoa nuts and then you know you look at I don't know if you've been paying attention to what these Senators did but there's some Senators they had a behind-closed-doors meeting about the coronavirus in China and what it means United States and you know the various impact and they went out sold their stock and mediately they were talking about how under control the government had it and how we're prepared and how it's going to be fine meanwhile they knew they knew so they had to face is that a public face that they're given to us to try to keep us calm and then they had a private face which realized the stock market was going to take a huge loss and so they sold everything and made amends profits based on the information that they found out he's closed-door meetings about the coronavirus how are they supposed to hit that legal to do how does that work do you understand how that works I'll give you have allowed you to make money wasn't that like whatever was trying to do like if you like what is the point of playing the stock market if you don't know things and if you do know things would you no more because you know the guy was the president tells you something about something to do and you're not supposed to trade then because of that information like alright okay I'm sure there's a logic to it I'm a moron don't run it by me but if that's what is it with the Senators do if they knew that the coronavirus is economy if they knew that it was coming down like a f****** storm of hail that no one could stop if they knew and then they bailed out and made amends profits that seem so shady to seem so shady that they didn't advise people you're supposed to be a leader right if you're in a position of an elected representative you're supposed to be acting in the position of a leader and if you are way to lead is tell people one thing with act in a completely different direction tell people everything's going to be fine but then start selling your stock at a profit and you don't tell other people to do it because you're worried the Navy that information is going to cause some ripple effect is going to destroy the economy even before the coronavirus hits just had a panic and fear in people going to act wrong but you acted in a different way than the way you were talking you acted like this s*** was going to be real you act like there's going to be a real problem and then the questions like how much of a problem did they think it was going to be maybe they dumped the stock that I was going to be a little problem would that be okay nobody but they found I was going to be a huge problem and it's not well that seems weird to me too like I don't know what should the rules be with information in the stock market stock market is gross like the whole thing's gross like what do we base our economy on this f****** Madness the stock markets crashed in a way that was you're going like it's based on I know that it's for commercial businesses their loans going to come up and it's going to be tough for them but at some point you're like I wish you could just put it on freeze and go hey let's come back in like 2 months let's start where we were let's make sure everyone was fed like that's the ultimate real because if it supposed to be about confidence and things rising and falling this is like the ultimate expression of that there's no confidence you can't work like crazy and there's so many industries that are happening and it's only jobs and unemployment the lowest rate is haven't been ever in history people then all the sudden it's not anymore or course is going to crash so it's going to crash this is the crash this is the big one is the big one of our lifetime maybe the biggest one ever because she could go on for a long ass time this is scary to could you think of all those people just like who are paycheck-to-paycheck you know with waiting tables or teaching a spin class or whatever it is that's where my brain goes like yeah that does let me know that's all I do all day to spend like McDonald's or like say there's a way to buy a bunch of Happy Meals I can send you a neighborhood you can do that with certain restaurants you can support restaurants with buffet restaurants in Vegas guytanno's is in Henderson and Eastman Calabasas we should go to him way back in the day but they are they're doing a lot of takeout and then they're also raising money for their employers which is very nice and I think the store doing something like that we're all going to donate for the waitstaff you know cuz the wait staff is completely shut out of locked and they were doing you no good business down there and tell those folks I'm sure they have bills like serious f****** bills and it's just piling up and there's no business you know I mean they went from having a great place we can go and you can count on x amount of money per week to all sudden gone and no one saw coming that's never happened ever you can't blame them for not being prepared but you know they're part of our comedy family man we got to we got to take care of them but at the store we should set up something for the Improv too and we should also you know just figure out a way to you know it's like find out who's hurting like who's in trouble because specially in our community a Comics that we know little people do proud because there's a lot of comics in our community we are Headliners with you and making you know x amount per week and you know you got to pay your own flight and all that jazz you getting by but you not killing it and then you have you probably have a f****** apartment across two grand a month or more you know I mean New York City those guys just f****** apartments in New York City are ridiculous</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> isn't it also partly because the discussion is out there and the discussion is a very attractive the discussion of one of the reasons why you haven't gotten by in this world is because of inequality and because of some sort of systemic racism systemic sexism or systemic homophobia transphobia and it becomes when you give people an option to find an excuse they gravitate towards all these pieces are in place as much as many many moving parts right and I think all these little pieces are in place where we also have these massive Echo Chambers because of social media we have these people that you know they find ideologically similar human beings and they bounce off of each other friend somebody who's indeterminate between male and female physiological so okay let's imagine that they have karyotype XY profile and that the developmental process did not produce an ambiguous genitalia okay is that a hermaphrodite pretty terrific and I look at all the forms it's a male female and I just you know my heart sinks like we're not even in trans here we're talking about somebody whose biological card that they were Del could have been you could have been me and through no no choices at all this person is being shoehorned into a paradigm which puts them in an increased risk of suicide and it breaks my heart we should change it we should break the male-female dichotomy absolutely now I have a different feeling about trans but if we solve the issue of intersex which is not pressuring just accepting that some tiny percentage of the population which is not vanishingly small just large is neither mostly male and female terms of genotype phenotype concordance we will do most of the work necessary to take care of our trans folks were suffering to might not trans is a much more Rich world because they're a million different issues taking place in trans and they're all conflated no part of it because of Developmental biology part of it because gender really in some sense is socially constructed in a way that like when people say mathematics is socially constructed I have to reject it you don't give this example of like jolts and lungis from Scotland and India are skirts but they're not female in those places so you have to learn about male and female relative to the codification in your Society in the issues of water are what are obligations to recognize hey this is really a female mind in a male body versus this is a regular mind in a regular body but needs instruction all these things are conflated and I was really hoping that we if you know if we used intersects at the test case to break the the the binary because the binary is an impression there's no question in my mind about it was it an impression because it was imagine that I say I have persistent mullerian duct syndrome so I'm phenotypically on the outside male and I go to my doctor and says hey you got a uterus what is okay that's an exotic situation maybe I want to identify male dinner because the outside equipment looks male it's a it's a it's a weird situation maybe the idea of it as being a present for a friend of mine who is in either situation yet oppressive like what is it oppressive if people are just recognized like most people recognize as being able to walk there is no category called disabled in a wheelchair sounds like to me like it's one thing to recognize that not everybody is in the standard category but it's another thing to hard-code like hard-code where you talking about job or female other or prefer not to say we have to let me Define lotion or female emotionally emotionally I think this is oppression oppression yeah I'm at the interests of defining people simply because for the most part yet dealing with males and females and it's for the most part they're just trying to figure out what's what for their statistical but you know this is fun I'm glad you're asking me these questions because you have to be on the other side of this issue and this is really where my heart is I care about these people and I know that in every single conservative Society in the world there are accommodations made for the failure of simple binaries to accommodate the population there's no Society this we have to recognize that every single population produces gender sexual ambiguity but isn't that also to get around the idea of homosexuality being a grievous crime cuz like I believe in Iran it's illegal to have homosexual activity but you can have gender reassignment so if your a game and you can choose to become a female that's true but there's also a thriving Gacy Tehran you know do they have to recognize and they're all sorts of music you know that there was a situation in India where I'm going to have more experience where you would sell those two people are confirmed Bachelors now that they're so dedicated to their professions that there's no room for family and they live together right so like traditional societies have everybody accommodates homosexuality and failures of simple gender binaries and do I always bring up the example of Turkish lira Turkish doesn't hard-code the third person singular pronoun as male or female it just has one pronoun for both so thank you for giving me the opportunity to know where my heart actually has been this entire time which is I believe this is impressive and I don't think that expresses that many people but I believe that it's an important oppression that we have to realize that we hard-coated in that ice was generated a lot of the feeling before we get to trans you can simply say from the position of intersex that the world is a richer place than male and female people so it took 6 versus XYZ for the most part for the most part it is so try to deal with but that is important to me like people who are outside of the Norms I think it probably a larger percentage of those people are going to be more interesting people because they're forged in the fire so it's not just a case that you know do you want to chase a couple of edge cases everybody was a really different experience is more important to me than everyone with the standard experience I think we have to keep take care of the standard case but I'm absolutely interested in outliers and edge cases so it's not just a case that you know do you want to chase a couple of edge cases everybody was a really different experience is more important to me than everyone with the standard experience I think we have to keep take care of the standard case but I'm absolutely interested in outliers and edge cases</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I think our problem in this country there's this many problems with one of our problems is the loudest voices on the fringes and this is one of the things that I want to discuss with you is what's going on in Portland and I think what's going on in Portland is the loudest voices on the fringes that the people on the right and on the far right and recognizes recognizing as emblematic of the left they think it defines the left and I don't think it does I think it is it's a symptom of its it's a symptom of first of all terrible government of of of someone who's allowing this to flourish inside of the mayor of Portland who seems to be supporting this in some sort of a weird way and and ideologically believes that antifa just because of a name stands for anti-fascist if you had no name which you would have is a bunch of Hood wearing mask wearing violent thugs were eating people who disagree with them and cuz that's what we saw with that Andy how do you say his name go is it Higgins ending no no and it's angio is silent until somebody what you saw from that video yet anyone could support that of with a person who's just talking they didn't mean what I've seen of him but they've tried to describe that he supports neo-nazis that he supports the proud boys I've seen none of this do you know evidence to this but I've seen the narrative try it out over and over again as a justification for violence against him when the left supports bullying in the worst possible form be ganging up on someone punching them hitting them with the sticks crowbars all this crazy s*** thinking that it's okay to throw milkshakes at people thinking this is fine this is nothing if you think this is a horrible precedent to set and it's a terrible it's the terrible move if you're playing a game it's a terrible first move because things only escalate they don't DS but no one says wow you beat the s*** out of andino's and Mysteries right like what the hell is going on what the hell do you allowing people to wear masks and carry backpacks with weapons and there's a natural human inclination when someone gets hit to jump in and hit him too so if you see it all the time watch Worldstar go to worldstarhiphop.com and watch someone gets hit a bunch of people just jump in and hit them it happens at trucks Austin f****** high schools it happens people get brain damage people die each other all the time people who get permanent injury when you're seeing in Portland there was one of them where an old guy got hit in the head with a f****** crowbar for a some math kid because the old guy apparently disagreed with a all disagree on things I don't someone's decide guesses at the old guy is not exactly is portrayed I would leave that the old guy may have been there with a telescoping baton know that he was hitting people we will take this I think this is so worthwhile but like a let's do it right okay because I think this is so mysterious what the hell people doing supporting Andino being beaten up on video so it stay stay with him because that's the the best clearest example of someone who's a tiny little gay man he's tiny mean he represents so many different maligned populations right sectional Publican I thought he was left-of-center I've been told I'm a f****** alt right guy glad it's very confusing all right he's also diminutive in physical form as he's not he's not threatening physically right and they've chosen this guy as an example and one of the more disturbing things are how many people saw the video and we're justifying it saying things like get another hobby these and the Ant fascist will not stand for you know your your your bigotry in your hate like what are you talkin to you think it's okay to punch this guy like the fact that you guys all piled on and punched him in there I've been thinking a lot about it I have a model I'm happy to hear yours because there is a mystery we both agree to beat the beginning that you would imagine that that video would have shocked people into flying so many people sort of excusing it is really shocking well it ain't given that he's also clearly intersection you wouldn't predict this from first principles know you wouldn't do it looked at it on paper you definitely would especially if you allowed him to self-identify as left-of-center okay so here's how I think the model goes unless you want to give yours first the first thing we have to understand is that there's a Division I want to live this at Super carefully the first division is between the what you're calling the loudest voices and I'm going to call the most courageous the most willing to accept loss the voice is most willing to accept loss most of the left does not want to be dragged to the extreme left to hear this thing that why are you focusing on a fringe and the answer is because The Fringe is running the show in my pants what do you mean by willing to accept loss if you go in antifa vs. proud boys melee you're willing your ear you accept that your may get clock with a bike lock. I don't think that'll wreck on I don't think that's correct I think you're dealing with people that have no concept of real violence no experience of real loud if you seen yes there have you seen the image of the guy who looks like he's never worked a day in his f****** life looks like he's never been outside and I think these people are playing a shocking game you are willing so you think you're going to get into a Wylie Coyote versus the Roadrunner kind of a thing we're both of them always survive to the next cartoon oh how anyone's willing to do that but they're willing to do that and they're willing to do that because they're delusional delusion boarded and they're delusional perspective by the giant numbers of them they all had to get and then to wear masks which further emphasizes this illusion at their Bartow game assume that you are not even in a physical situation you're willing to be very loud on social media about very simplistic perspectives yes and you're willing to become a pariah at some level because are you though I think mostly your supported do I need are more support I'm not necessarily your going to trigger so many times on this explanation that I probably just need a little place in the table to start building this up and then you can tear the hell okay the first believe it is at the belief that I have is at the fringes are much more running the show then the people who claim that this is a small number of people believe that the fringes are scary going to go places the rest of us aren't I agree with you on both sides left and right so I spend a lot of time focused on the fringes because the fringes become terrifying and the middle is become cowardly the whole principle of that the whole idea will you thing was about creating a non cowardly for the could actually potentially hold the center because people are actually fairly courageous you would have to say my brother is fairly courageous Ben Shapiro Andino Sam Harris these are people that stood up to death threats you know I have a guy is threatening me everyday of my life in a coming through the internet in my family you have to have some courage in order to be part of this thing and that's part of my irritation when people come after it so there is a cowardly Center in a very terrifying Fringe in the fridge is going around the whole thing left and right the next thing is that people are secretly weirdly sympathetic but they're violent the violent Fringe to their extreme rather than making common cause across the center so for example you imagine that you run a laundromat and you're being visited by a member of organized crime every week they comes into the laundromat and he kind of plays with your stuff and he says I would be if anything happened your business and shakes you down there say oh you know I noticed that you have a daughter I would love to date her breath will go out sometime you hate this guy then some sort of Vineland Village vigilante element its operating extrajudicial e after you've gone to the police over and over again break this guy's knee caps you're weirdly sympathetic with the Vigilante because you're being terrified by a group that is not being taken care of I think that this is in part why some elements of the left there should be more responsible to have institutional positions that have platforms that they can broadcast a weirdly sympathetic to antifa and why Country Club Republicans are weirdly sympathetic to some of these far-right groups is that they view them as this is the dangerous group that's kind of taken care of the problem that I can't stand up to so you bizarre cowardly sympathy from the center who won't actually stand up and say I have more in common with a country club Republican like in my case I feel myself as a progressive released a liberal I have more in common with a country-club republican than somebody who's got a bike lock who's looking for trouble in a street demonstration trying to smash up a Starbucks right I don't want the help from my left the group that wants to play this out using the sort of proxy groups to handle the problems saying look we're going to we're going to sound an air horn before one of these things so that all reasonable people can get the hell out of the way and if you don't respond then your collateral damage and that's on you that's how they see this I think that's another words I think Andino is the guy doesn't listen to the air horn Bret Weinstein doesn't listen to the air horn Peterson Sam Harris don't listen to the air horn not that I didn't does very accurate description of these Fringe people doing the work of the people that are more reasonable but are happy to have these bad people do do their work to fight this battle for them because they think that ultimately it's for good yeah I need my organized crime group to get rid of your organize yes right so the idea that the Law and Order people like I know you don't want anybody nicecream group and I'm going to actually stand up to the Mob and I'm actually not going to pay you your goddamn protection money because I'm in a laundromat in this is the United States of American f*** off that's that's the view that I represent I don't want thank you Auntie if I don't need your help yeah you know what I actually a much more afraid of the far-right in the reason I concentrate my negative energy on the far left is what he trying to do trying to get the genie out of the bottle on the far right that is the danger that you want to see more tiki torches it's not tiki torches that you need to worry about its armed people who come and they not that I bring him by Chloe pushing ordinary human beings to the extremes yeah right and the thing that I get is that like I believe that the Republican party and I just I never got a chance to say the stuff I have never gotten along with Republican party I just don't like it if you would hit the thing that wants to exclude me from the country clubs I have an older model the group that wanted to put in condo developments in Yosemite Valley because they couldn't figure out why we would want to preserve the national parks they're the ones that laughed about the clubbing the baby seals hahaha these people emotional Cadence and we always had this thing where the Democrats will we have most of the smart people in a tiny fraction of time we have seen this giant evapo live intelligence if not actually threw a lack of Courage the people who represent responsible left-wing

care of that we take our responsibilities but not our guilt as the reason for trying to make a better world the believe in structural oppression but don't believe in the extent claimed you know who

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> that's a dirty little secret. This is one of the things that bothers me so much about you being so misrepresented when I read things about you with there was a the article that we're just talking about the alt-right sage without the rage they called you and you're not even remotely alt-right in fact you were deleting Target of anti-Semitic abused for all of 2016 where you legitimately battling the alt-right talking about how evil I think their ideology is how evil I think white supremacy is meant personal like people, cuz typically not the favorites of the alt right and then beyond that I mean I think their ideology is legitimately a devastatingly awful Twist on what western civilization is supposed to be reviewed my new book and my new book has several sections and they're dedicated and then the interview they did with me about alt right stuff at all but they just assume I'm on the fence right that must mean that I'm all right it's like no you stupid that you're spouting at you thought these things I've been doing this for legitimately more than half my life I'm 35 and I start around 17 and I started writing a syndicated column at that point and winter 17 you think a lot of dumb stuff and then surely get older and you educate yourself and you spend a lot of time reading a lot of time studying hopefully you have some cogent arguments after 20 years of doing anything but it did the demonization is pretty astonishing knew we had Anton Andrew Yang he's the only Democratic candidate has agreed to go on but I do we did a full hour on Ubi a perfectly nice it was perfectly coherent and and and conciliatory and get people will suggest that everything I do is about destroying people on the other side because of all the Ben Shapiro destroys videos and certain groups of people were that's their stick they're like their goons right they just go after people online for attention yes this is a stick this is not you and this is what bothers me so much and I know that you said some things in the past like particular about Arabs and like when you were a younger man that you said I should have said that that's exactly right was a tweet that was part of a tweet thread which are specifically contrasting Israel and Hamas leadership and saying that the Israeli government likes to build leadership would prefer that their citizens live in sewage and bumping but that was a bad we obviously my entire history on Muslim relations is 1A I supported the ability of ilhan Omar to wear hijab on the on the floor opposed president finally proposed Muslim ban in the last three weeks I've had on Moschino eyes I've had on contact Med I had on yesterday before Muslim like he's our conversations that have to be had but to take this is one thing that bugs me so much and I actually go through all this look it up this time and look up all the things that I think I've done wrong and I apologize for something I'll say no more. I'm fine with your contacts but I hope that people try to do this is the problem you're not doing with honest people when people try to categorize you is all right or they're they're trying to put you into this category of Internet goon there quote tweet just taking some little tiny Praise You said seven years ago and trying to save this is you this is you now it's so that's such a disingenuous thing to do I hate it and I hate it across the aisle by the way you want to get rid of this person I've heard this person you're going to bring up something from 10 years ago and they're going to try and Club them into submission with it because if you actually ask them their opinion about it they might have a more nuanced view on what they said maybe they apologized and they maybe they think I don't remember saying that I felt the same way by the way I really do about about the stuff I said the same thing about the governor of Virginia who is excoriated for having this terrible racist photo on his yearbook page back in medical school in 1987 this is evidence of his career and he ended up doing what everyone now does which is you just don't apologize for anything you just trying to pass it off as a nothing is actually getting worse because are you say I apologize I was wrong and what why did you do in the first place because you're a bad person apologies are not accepted and then number two is you Brazen it out you do the Trump you know I never did anything wrong ever I've never been perfect to come around you and then nothing ever get the clan opportunity number three is Barack Obama did witches you come out preemptively and you try to remember all the bad stuff you do okay so you did cocaine when he was in high school that's that's cool what is it comes out during the campaign problem the problem is right now even if you preemptively come out and say I did something wrong like for example Liam Neeson talkin about years ago when he had a racist thought that he didn't act on us. This is now we're going to try and ruin your career for something that you admit was bad that you did 30 years ago we're going to try and run you over that if you apologize for something to eat at 30 years ago what you would have preferred I forgotten cuz his embarrassing and stupid then we say you're bad until all you're left with is like the most Shameless people in the world who are in the public space at the incentive structure is to be deeply Shameless to just stay and the culture of of going after people for things CNN finding anything to categorize them as someone who's a viable Target this is what I've seen thrust your way it's like there's nothing wrong with being conservative there's something wrong with wanting everyone to think the way you think though this is the difference like you will you wait what I like that you do is you debate your points you state your positions you have a philosophy and what I don't like is when people try to pretend that that philosophy is some some somehow hateful or somehow regressive or something that you condemn people for their thoughts you just you don't this is what I did not want to see with you I appreciate that and I appreciate the accuracy I think that's true I mean I've come out against virtually every Twitter ban including people who have personally targeted me I've come out against that have come out against virtually every what are your thoughts about this idea of deplatforming and you know this is something that we were just discussing before the podcast where the CEO of YouTube and carrots Kara Swisher they were talking about removing you from YouTube and I thought it was the CEO of YouTube it was actually Carro said I would if I could now being doxxed meaning just thinks differently from the down the line Democratic party platform you're not like them aligned with Hillary in order to make evidence-based point about discrimination and disparity and this makes him an enemy of people like Ezra Klein inbox.com say that your feet are for white supremacy right that they can't actually get you on what you say you know some members of your audience do things that that are really bad is it going dude I have 1 million two people were members of my own and have 5 million Facebook followers I've 2 million on some of those people are going to be crazy video switch what is a normal Jamie like a normal video that we get how many comments to get 10,000 pedophiles who are watching videos of children doing things and they were commenting stuff in the gymnastics commenting in the end like communicating with each other through the comments and it was sort of discovered that there was this connection that they were doing this and many many videos and YouTube rightly Panic they look really should have stopped this so the response I guess was we just have to make people responsible for their comments so is that all yeah good idea through it all right on one side of the aisle to take an example of congressional baseball shooting happened a couple of years ago guy happens to be a Bernie fan is that Bernie Sanders is false in a couple years ago guy happens to be a Bernie fan is that Bernie Sanders this fall.</div>

But it's the Chiefs Kansas City Chiefs are like what other Native American names has been a ton of them right still around I don't know the status of nem you know as far as NFL International Teams Syracuse Syracuse University had a derogatory mascot that they changed some years back because of the tribes they're there now in the state of New York fought for that turn orange orange visiting to Royals and a Ford Focus could run from the energy in the charged particles in the air what sing did like 15 miles an hour on a flat Test Track Running on are charged particles in the air has a charged particles as the entire 15 miles an hour could be a real speed wow around for the sniffing around and see this trippy scientist guy in his lab coat in this s***** little booth was like 6 by 10 ft booth and you know how to show where people like 200 by 60 foot the development for rail cars for semis for cars like an on and on and on as I get the biggest problem is stopping it once it gets going because the Troy deal structure meant that the compression cycle from you know 12 to 2 of that first cylinder was such that when the combustion occurred and it propelled the next piston into the next combustion cycle and kept going so getting that power out of the simple crank was a challenge and then how to stop the damn thing was like the bigger challenge did run on like horse piss ionic charge particles diesel gas at the spark plugs and I have to try to reach out to him website going to look at the Night Before Dawn that gobbled up 5 years later another Kick-Ass 2 a man was he a bitter man so I can never again cuz they bought it and they shelled it I'm never selling anything again f*** them I'm licensing to specific channels of application and that's it his new product so what do you think happened if your conspiracy theorist you think someone bought him out and just bought a small independent business owner real real estate deepest part of like sound like it's calling Mommy group so it's like a connection of online of all these mommies and unlike all over LA and what they do is they post people post s*** they need so like one of the moms just had two kids they don't have any wet wipes and so then all the other moms and then maybe transcend money for a second and figure out ways to set up in their Community like what do you need what do I have and then start some form of like trade or just giving people you know there was someone he set up a toilet paper Exchange old people who say they're Dickie to ship mad at you no it's not it's not good but I'm saying we can get a positive out of this through the people that make it through we can get a positive out of this in the positive is communities important to really important and it seems like it wasn't important cuz it seems like everything set up so you didn't have to engage with people it's not the right way to do it it's not good for anybody now that kind of life is not good in the Detachment that we had me that's why why do you think people have road rage on the highway you know when they are blocked in a little box separated from people in a way that they believe but they wouldn't have it in person it was just a piece of metal and glass separating from these people visit the other added factor of the heightened senses because of driving fast. I got to make quick movements so dumb things people do for elevated and turn even the more dumb yeah because of the world the beach because the sonars messing up their ability to communicate with each other it's like there's this kind of technological sonar that is completely made of disconnected from the earth essentially like our Earth connection has been replaced by a technological connectnow technology having exactly the same thing you have witches they want to be happy you know she's feeling the connection between people when you're with someone I know I don't know if you ever done that but just like the next time you're around anybody that you're like buying ship from or that you don't normally just kind of go by feel like that cannot even feel it there's an energetic connection that you can feel their that's easy to overlook the week is another good example start Sunday in the evening and ends Friday in the afternoon and you give out hours of sleep on Wednesday that's it it's horrendous to go through and it's pretty entertaining as an instructor cuz you can totally f*** with the students cuz they're off their rocker by Tuesday afternoon but almost all of the attrition occurs from Sunday night until I'd say Tuesday morning and beyond that you're probably going to make it through cuz you've invested so much but device that I was given when I went through was don't look at hell week as a 5-day pipeline just make it to your next meal they have to feed you every 6 hours so if stack 6 hours on 6 hours and 6 hours and just focus on getting to the next meal doesn't matter how much I'm in pain doesn't matter how cold am I can just get to the next meal or get a reprieve a mental reset and I can continue on that's that in combination with some you know the mental toughness is how you approach and set your goals and then resilience in my definition of resilience would be the ability to get bent and come back stronger than you were before how you do that is by bending yourself as often as possible which you do all the time by running Sprints or you don't mean that you're doing that stuff you're mentally tough because of that and if you can apply that resilience to approaching setting an approaching your goals from digestible perspectives you can accomplish insane amount so that's really what I mean it's a physical test or just testing the mind can the individual ignore the big and focus on the small can you do the stuff that you need to do and not get overwhelmed regardless if your exhausted hungry cold and it is it's not a complex training program that there's the ocean there's the beach there's some telephone poles or some boats and then later on WE introduce scuba gear and towards the tail end of it that you know some Demolition and pistol and rifle hungry cold it is it's not a complex training program that there's the ocean there's the beach there's some telephone poles or some boats and then later on WE introduce scuba gear and towards the tail end of it that you know some Demolition and pistol and rifle</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> no I was listening to a podcast I didn't know that you were involved in the rescue of Jessica Lynch it was the second target that we hit and the first invasion of Iraq that's crazy it was an odd series of events you know we went over there I had just finished the selection process for the East Coast command and they actually there are the best way to describe it there are multiple squadrons inside of that command that's what they're all have the same skillset but you need multiple so want to be unemployment while another one is training and the other one is resting you want to get into a mental rotation cycle so at the end of selection acts number of people get partitioned off each one of those and it takes time to get up to speed because the selection tactics in the way that you trainer they're good but you get better as you were working with the guys have more experience specifically The Real World experience and so they pulled us out of selection about a month early and see over to augment the Karzai detail in Afghanistan at the very tail end I mean nothing happened with a skating you know you're determined to that point and it's one of the worst missions because you can't is very reactive security detail stuff you can't really do anything until somebody else does something so you already behind the power curve to my least favorite Mission said I think but we came back from that and then the until started kicking off for Iraq and they sent it over to Saudi Arabia and we were there for probably somewhere between seven to ten days that's where I watch Bush give the speech no snob Hussain has any was 24 hours to comply or turn himself in whatever it was and we had already taken a look at we knew before going over there that there were two or three objectives that we were going to look at we had already basically planned missions that we were going to do while we're in Virginia Beach we were planning for stuff and Iraq's we continue the planning in Saudi Arabia in the number one hit was the number one chembio Target in Iraq so to do that you have to get all the s*** on this is called mopp gear mission-oriented protective posture so I can chemical chembio suit gas mask which compounds a lot of stuff you have all your normal shift on anyway like those guys carrying quickie saws in a hazmat suit with a gas mask on breathing through a blower on their back over working the blower and it's amazing how close to Suffocation of actually come inside of a gas mask it's the worst feeling ever but that you're sucking so hard for hair that the math is like stink bugs you're not supposed to be physically exerting yourself while you wearing that thing there's a there's a canister on the side how much weight do you carry it around in those days was probably bodyweight + 8200 lb and it turned down after that because the actual amount of real-world experience at that time was low and a drastically increased so you like you know I think I need the pocket and then you would need it for months so I need to get rid of this goddamn pocket because it carries sweat and oh yeah there's gear that I wore towards the end was substantially different than the you that I Ward towards the beginning I trimmed I mean I think I probably had 10 magazines on me like that first started I think the last appointment they do cherry 441 in the gun and no pistol things changed over time but the ability to move cuz then I would need less food and I would need less water not actually be mobile but on this target so is it for our helicopter ride in we're sitting there we have all of our mop your own but not our masks and we're doing a mid-air Refuel on a C-130 so yet a 47cc know the big double propeller Sobe the rotor blades on top of helicopter they're hooked up next to a C-130 in-flight refueling missile goes underneath the C-130 is like see you boys later bombs out and it like the C-130 bailed when the but so you're just sitting there waiting for 3 and 1/2 you know 3 and 3/4 hours in about 10 minutes out you start getting your gas mask and stuff long to get a stuff that drape and you know night vision goggles to repair your field of view sucks Terrible's weird which is why you've noticed when people who are actually using them they will all constantly have movement in their head because they're increasing their field of view and up and down and that's when you can Orient them to a good offset to your I now imagine putting a gas mask in between your eye and the lens of the night vision goggle figure taken already limited field of view and putting it into a so distraught the first combat Target I've ever been on so and you're 18 years 2525 you still going to graduate and then you know continue on and I was in like a third or fourth 47 that went in so you finally get all of your stuff on you know you have a blower on your back so there's ways that you can help the canister if you just have the canister on your mask it's a lot like breathing through a few straws shove in your mouth if you maintain a loan of heart rate and you're totally chill you're fine but as your heart rate goes up in your demand you know for oxygen goes up your really limited so they have no you can put on your back the blower to battery power blower that will basically push air into the mask and it gives you I would say more buffer space it's like almost like a positive pressure and if you're not doing much is actually really nice it's just Jammin Eridan face and it works well unless you put your weapon swing over the top of that to which is exactly what I did it was terrible so we come in number one can buy or Target in Iraq and we had looked at it from the perspective of like air conditioning specialists and when the owl from Architects to what we could encounter on the ground Potential Threat satellite imagery of historical stuff and we get there and by the time I even got on the ground there was already a firefight going on the helicopter that I was in head 27 rounds come to the helicopter not a single person with her guys are like reaching out to like scratch their ass and like around come through and dismiss everybody Jesus Christ the door gunner standing next to me got shot right in the head in about a minute out that was my first exposure to combat just over and helicopter lands and you go and by the time I got to the front door of that structure I was probably as close to being unconscious do this fixation is I often m coming down and instantaneously we could tell that it was agricultural school like the intelligence was so horribly and Incredibly off when I came to that I just ripped my mask off at some point I would have rather died from whatever horrendous disease could have been in there then suffocate and then you know we cleared through it and I knocked my night vision goggles off with a sledgehammer and go back to the shitshow so we get back from that the next morning we wake up and remember having a cup of coffee with a buddy of mine has like a man I don't think we're going to get out of this if things keep going like they did last night and shortly after that a few days after that we got word that Jessica had been captured so we forward staged and went up to Nigeria and the information that we had going into the hospital is that it was a FedEx hotbed like 50 to 500 people was the expected amount of resistance so we can have and we can fit 27 people in the helicopter so that's what we launched in the back of our head and force me to meet any resistance inside of the structure and it actually was kind of business-as-usual looking back like there was nothing exciting about that Target whatsoever people in the modern-day if they were to action that Target now with the experience if they have that you wouldn't even register on the radar Scopes amount of the little little amount of resistance that was encountered outside of the discs would be another day at the office of that and then there was a lot of dispute about that was accurate there was a member she actually tell you cleared up a lot of it she was not responsible for a lot of the things that were said because he was deep into the repatriation process into I mean her she's f***** up to this day when I sat down I thought I could sit across the table she had never sat down and talked to somebody who was there it was when did you meet her I went out again it was one of the earlier episodes I told my side of the story and we were able to like Salem gaps and we sat across the table just like this and she still wears a brace she came and gave me a huge hug and I didn't know what to expect them to her physically but my understanding the vast majority of her injuries came from when her Humvee wrecked I do not believe she was buckled her strapped in so she got just pounded and she would not treated well you know it's guys are going to get the same mind you're going to get raped if you're a male or a female really oh yeah for sure and he captured oh yeah for sure if you're male or female you're not going to have a good go of it for sure and again I'm not an exact expert on what happened specifically with her but from my understanding she experienced that as well as medical issues but when we she was in bad shape when we pulled her out of the hospital for sure but then so then I remember there were two people with us that were carrying video cameras and there was a little bit of footage that was taken from that like when she was in the hospital bed in the hospital and a lot the rest of it was from the cameras on the helicopters and some of the sensors overhead but the narrative from that not a word was said by anybody that was there actually getting that objective or from her and I think my hypothesis is you know we were month into that wore a lot of that war was based on we need to go rid this country in this dictator of there wmds we hadn't found any from PR perspective wise it wasn't probably going as well as they wanted it to do and they wanted to have a PR Victory but this stuff that was said the stuff that made the news all this stuff that got blown out of proportion none of that came from the people that were actually there all the layers on top of it I remember I remember some of the first sports they were saying that she was going to be the first female Medal of Honor recipient that she had fought until she had her you know she expanded her last round and then was finally overtaken and you talked to her and she or she never even loaded weapon or weapons Jam Chichi never said that she fought and then I remember people talking about you never said any of that I mean it takes time understand the details of what happened she was not in a headspace to give a debrief you know she was literally being flown probably did Germany for her first round of countless surgeries and she's going to need to spend time with a therapist and a counselor I would assume she what I'm saying before but they're going to let you know they're going to do it robust medical treatment and that's really not the time to dive into the details of her exact actions and we left the next morning and flew into Baghdad like 3 days later like it was just another day on the job off and running it was cool because it was the first rescue uspw since World War II and so the rescue of her was she was rescued from the hospital and so they had abused her and then taking her to a hospital I get a little grainy on the details of what happened in between the wreck in only picked her up because there are conflicting narratives there are there are I know what the correct word would be stories or there are reports they attempted to put her into an ambulance and bring her back to US forces but at the same time the fedayeen were using ambulances is basically military fighting Vehicles so they said that when they try to do that the ambulance was shot at which makes sense if there was a a trend of people using an ambulance as a military vehicle that would make sense and they would get turned around so they might have tried to bring her back you know that hospital was being used as a setting staging point because there I mean they're not dumb people they understand we're not going to likely bomb hospitals or relay structures so use them to their military Advantage Wow Wow in this is your second your second real how crazy that mean that story was a giant story in the media about the war and people trying to sort out what was true versus what was the you know the publicity narrative I would say on average take 90% of what you that story was a giant story in the media about the war and people trying to sort out what was true versus what was the you know the publicity narrative I would say on average take 90% of what you hear off the top 90%</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> seems like that's one of those things are once you get through and once you get through buds once you get through hell week once you get through all the difficult physical tasks and it you actually become a seal how many people maintain that sort of Goggins Jocko level of discipline and keep training constantly and how many people do the bare minimum it's hard to say there are people who slip what are the requirements once you once you've gone through all that s*** is very few when I was in in 2013 though I left last day of June to 2013 so if it is changed since then I don't know nothing about it but you know the Navy it obviously it's a Navy SEAL to you're governed by the United States Navy they make you do a PRT of physical Readiness test which is running pull-ups push-ups sit-ups and a swim I think because we're seals and your wife could meet the standards my eleven-year-old daughter could probably meet they're not crazy I'm saying to the bar if you trip over the bar at that point like you know your hamstrings not work her it just you suck but there are varying levels there are people who are very like the individuals that you're talking about and then there are others that will let it slip and I slip a percentage Point overtime and there's some you know obese disgustingly overweight seals not many bring in between so it's hard for me to give you like exact numbers on that I would say more guys Trend towards the Jocko Goggins realm because it's a very self-critique and community in most ways it's like working inside of a piranha tank and if there's a drop of blood there just delete you now we're very hard on each other for sure how much how many of them are involved in martial arts gym hard to say because I know it has drastically changed since I was in the amount of so I was before I sat down with Henry Gracie yesterday we were just talking about a lot about his interaction with law enforcement and how they got started and it was with the Rodney King riots actually didn't know that but that's when they started interfacing with law enforcement he had his dad the generation before him they started sitting on a panel you know talking about I think it's actually combatives with the hand on hand type stuff with it yes but that's where it started it's grown since then when I went through. I don't remember much discussion of martial arts at all there was Prisoner handling or you know detaining people and cutting them to terminating point would be to get their hands behind their back and flex cuff that we didn't use metal handcuffs way to use tie ties you know just cuz that you can put a lot you can slide him in your gear and just easily snatch on them but I think that it has drastically changed I have been in and I think a lot of that that was driven by individuals I mean I'm sure you see it I mean I feel so stupid being late to the game to Jiu-Jitsu and I know that it is definitely want to say invading all of those communities but it might be a good term inspecting it's just it's there's a Groundswell from guys we're learning on their own so it's increasing but it was not prevalent when I was in unless you were an individual practitioner doing it on your own or had a buddy that would do with you I would have assumed that it would have been a core part of training like from the beginning just to build character and to understand what happens if you do lose your gun if you are in a situation where you don't have a weapon well there's not a lot of situations in real life that you can point back to from my community where that has happened and quite frankly ego gets into the way and you'll hear guys say things like well what do I need to bro I do need to go Hands-On with anybody this is what I got right here best really just ego and what ends up happening is I was talking with him about this yesterday and I have a much better understanding of it now you can elicit actions from people if you don't know what you're doing if you do have to go Hands-On and you're trying to detain somebody but you're asking about how much I weigh right I want to hear I had so I'm that usually would float somewhere between 2:05 to 2:15 when I was in so add 80 to 90 pounds on top of that and now I'm kneeling on your back understand weight distribution I don't understand leverage I don't understand the way that the joints move that well and you're trying to comply but I'm applying so much weight to you that it's forcing you towards a fight or flight situation and you can you can increase the deadly deadliness of these situations unintentionally and get yourself into a position where you might have to take somebody's life but I didn't deserve it was actually your fault because you drove them to that point because you were not judiciously applying the pressure that you needed to see that with police when you watch videos get cops trying to detain suspects and then they lose control situation and it's purely because they don't have an understanding of how to control person a running of tools I had a ton of empathy for law enforcement if you're out on the streets and you have verbal commands than a taser and maybe a pepper sprays in there somewhere I don't even know if they still use that but then your next resources at gun and you rapidly go through all those options I other situations occur and I'm not trying to justify them in any way whatsoever but I understand what happens when you reached the limits of your tools and you're left with what you think is a life-threatening situation breaking down what goes wrong with the police when they're trying to detain someone admitted often times two and three on one and they wind up getting killed there's there's videos of guys having a suspect on the ground and the suspect is not trained in martial arts but unfortunately the cops aren't either and they're doing this things in hitting this person and trying to control me then the guy gets out gets to his car pulls out a gun and kills them and I've watched a video like that recently so the guy who got me into can get to the sheriff and I actually just the only reason I started it because I wanted him to shut up I had known him for like a year so we're my house drunk downstairs at the bar and he was like you know we're standing there drinking you try to play me like a standing head and arm pretty like this is how I would choke you is like if you start right now you'll never top music for stripe white belt at the time that it will be out shortly after he got pulled into and started Jiu-Jitsu because of Buddy at his attitude in your life or death fight where I live up in Kalispell Sheriff's Department on shift and a response time of 20 to 30 minutes in possible for sure so this guy goes out he's in the fight for his life and like two feet of snow in the winter time and I think that's a f****** problem right if you need to call for backup if they have procedures like I guess if you check in and then we're certain. Of time like me don't people start moving their car on the right direction start coming to you if you don't check in a long what time you know the lights and siren come on so other people came he was okay and he just got his brown belt not too long as a Savage what at so what happened to him obviously I wasn't there but it was he pulled somebody over for a particular reason I don't know what it was and this is an interesting thing to that I've come to understand better developing friendships with law enforcement you know they they come up to a car and they are just they're doing a stop and it's another touchpoint for their day but somebody in a car might be in the back of their mind thinking oh my God I have a misdemeanor or felony I might be going to prison for the rest of my life so two very different headspaces as they converge in this instance I believe it a pistol that was in between the driver seat and the little center console individual win for it somehow they came out of the car and it just became a scuffle at that point and they fought until other cops arrived and they squeak dog piled on the person and ended it and it was over I believe they were at that for like 10 to 15 minutes cheese and for people who don't understand how hard it is to go that hard for 10 or 15 minutes I mean f*** if they weren't in shape and that guy was that would have been deaf so he sound Jiu-Jitsu he just got his he's awesome but he started my buddy who made that comment and then I have started they'll do defensive tactics. I've helped him out twice while just go and I'll be a role player I'll just lay there on the ground and put my hands on my chest and I have to try to cost me and it's an eye-opening experience I mean I've been at this for 18 months I'll be the first to tell you I don't know s*** I'm at the point now where I'm starting to realize how little I actually know people about now correct yeah and it's it it's like a foreign language like I can kind of see a little bit of the alphabet but don't even think for a second that I'm trying to put together words yet let alone sentences and so I'll go in and I did I was a role player for two of those and pressing I saw some of the same stuff where you can elicit responses for people like I was I was resisting but not a crazy amount and the amount of pressure that they started like applying to me grabbing fingers and pulling my fingers back it it almost to me I like I wanted to ramp it up just like anybody else would solder without that skill or without that tool in their tool belt if you run out of options and its they mean they have a dangerous job back it it almost to me I like I wanted to ramp it up just like anybody else would so there without that skill or without that tool in their tool belt you run out of options and its they mean they have a dangerous job at it as it is</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you have a hot take on this handy what's your hot take by get text messages from people saying you know give me the inside scoop as to what's happening and what I should do yeah and I don't have a good answer I have the same information sources that everybody else does my concern is protect people that are sick and people that are old my concern is that these decisions are being done by politicians and that they they want to do this so that they can be elected Cambria election that they don't want people to be upset at them for not acting and so they're making these decisions and they're not showing us exactly how they're going to get out of this like when you shutting down Los Angeles for a month did just staggering amount of people that are going to be in debt and then there's some number that we looked it up recently of the amount of people that live check to check it's crazy it's like half of America I saw I was that they cannot absorb an expense outside of the normal over $400 that's gone that's already gone so already most Americans are fuct now just with this dip and then they're talking about extending this to April 19th I just don't I don't know if they have a plan I don't know how they're going to buy their way out of this like what do you do how do you how do you help those folks I mean I'm the wrong person to ask about that but I would I would hope at least at the politician I'm sure there's an aspect always if you are a politician in the back of your mind I have to conduct myself in a way where I can get reelected like everything is probably viewed through that but I would hope at least that they're viewing it through the humanity perspective and as far as the decisions are making I don't think anybody knows what to do so they're doing something we all need to look at Idris Elba cuz that guy looks f****** great he does he's got it he's got it and he seems fine Tom Hanks he says he just kind of tired it's I can't make heads or tails of it because if you go the longer you spend on your phone I think the more or your computer I think the more confused you actually become because I don't know but to be honest who's telling the truth and who is not their stories of people saying hey I tested positive for this I don't have any symptoms hey I live in Italy three people are dead in my hallway and I got sick and I don't feel that good and then you watch people walking around in zombie apocalypse suits with you know mopp level 4 gear on not listening to you know how they look on the beach yesterday and you know the people that huge social problems that I want to be near each other and from what I can tell from what I'm reading it again it's so heads or tails you know what you basically have to be caught on her Snead's owner touches surface that one of these infected people touched word close proximity and the people on the beach walking around and hazmat suits it's a wild time because of that because there's no clear information because you sing some people look really healthy and then you seen the stories that come out of Italy Italy is Italy has one of the oldest populations they they have a lot of old people and a s*** ton of smokers those two factors a huge here because this is a respiratory disease. They also have in comparison to the rest of the world more Generations living in a single household yes I would imagine is going to be you know as there's those Generations move on you're going to have high-risk people living with people who are low-risk but mine are transmitting it crazy just got back from Disneyland how like the fact they put that he just got back from Disneyland's it's all heart string pulling stuff but then if you go deep into the story this this young man just got over a testicular cancer he had bronchitis and he had asthma so there's a lot going on that had the deck stacked against the deck stacked against immune-compromised for sure because of coming off of the testicular cancer and then I but that with asthma and bronchitis and then he gets a respiratory disease those are the people that really have to worry and I really wish there was a clear way to help them other than shutting down everything for a month I was talking to Evan Hafer this morning called out of the blue and we were having kind of a conversation about this and he brought something up that just about the you know the narrative and it to me what's happening right now is is it's interesting from a cup prospectus for one I traveled in World enough and seen people living in a variety of different living conditions that right now in my opinion at least people are getting a glimpse into what it is like to live in the non first world where when maybe even have a grocery store but if you do that you can't get everything that you want and you can't travel all you know when you always want to know you don't have the freedom of movement that you want a lot of people live their life take the virus out of the equation a lot of people live life day today and situations just like this or much worse so I think it's should be eye-opening hopefully for people that there's a thin margin between the old Xs and luxury that we have in the first world and how fast that can be removed we can start stepping down that staircase and it shows to me you know I try to view the videos you see online of people fist fighting for a toilet paper I think those are the anomaly not try not to let you in we paint the norm I don't think most people are doing that but there are people that are doing that and they're people who are going in and they're hoarding and buying it and I don't think the toilet papers are good example I can give you 15 different ways to wipe your ass without toilet paper like you're going to be okay like it do you have a garden hose maybe we can start there I'm not even as the most yeah the clothes yeah what do you want to hit me and I have had many make it cleaner I didn't really check I don't have too much time but I've had many days where I started with two socks and ended with one I've had t-shirts that became tank tops I mean there's options that you have none of those I'm recommending for anybody but what I'm saying is the toilet paper we're talking about right before we went on when people get drunk couple of the layers of their protective like this is who I want to portray myself as you and what I see are people who are super concerned about me and far less concerned about we and the conversation I was having with Devin was you know it'd be great if we were talking about you know the people who are going to get crushed and I'm not an expert by any stretch of the ones already talked about a living paycheck-to-paycheck elderly who are in the high-risk category there on Social Security fixed-income and they can't even go out right now because they don't feel comfortable getting groceries at people going to get destroyed and I would love to have a conversation about a social construct or relationship that we have where we start talking about you know what we going to do to get food and Aid to these people what am I going to do to come together and help everybody out so that assholes and Target hoarding toilet paper to me a lot of that is driven by and a lot of is driven by Panic and believe me I'm not an expert at all probably on anything in my life but one thing that I have some experience in his surviving and thriving and high-risk situations that are high stress which is kind of what's going on right now is a different type of stress in the most dangerous thing you can do is lose control your emotions or let your emotions take over your decision-making cycle which is what I see people doing and it's it's so dangerous and I think we need to start finding ways to back away from that and start talking about the we greater than me I don't think there's a toilet there's a shortage of people with common sense we're buying too much toilet paper which is freaking other people out so they're buying too much stuff which they don't actually be which is freaking up an automated system affect a fear Kaskade it's not good it's not good it's all so this is the first time we as a nation have been tested like this with it with a crisis where the country had to shut down without any experience in it so we don't know what to expect what I hope is it it gives me a little bit of flashes is the right after 9:11 because we have had time for the country shut down but was very very brief but I remember like the solidarity after 9/11 it was all about we and you had about me and I hope that it trends that direction because who knows when this is going to end I mean my kids are out of school I think for the year per day at school what is Artie you know they're actually doing a really good job, these locations you can get free meals that's assuming the kid has a way to get there because Montana's scalable write a million people in the entire State the states f****** massive it's not out of control California's 40 million f****** people in this in one spot it's so Preposterous and there's so much poverty there's so many people that were barely hanging on as it is and now they're off the cliff and they don't know what to do and there's no real protection set in place now to keep them from being evicted in leave you know I don't like unscrupulous landlords people have been looking for a reason to get released people in the first place f*** man who knows who know who knows what's going to go on what's real confusing it's real confusing and it be seen the stats like the Jamie maybe put this up on the screen because it's kind of it's it's it's really kind of crazy that this is the choice that they've made to shut everything down right now got to we got here Thursday so a day before they made that decision and the decision was made last night and went into effect in exactly the same amount of people are still out I mean there's no real law I mean it was more of a recommendation than anything but they do have to close businesses will I think they're helping the people do buy into a social contract like maybe we can care about the we over me but I just you see people not doing that one it was more of a recommendation than anything but they do have to close businesses will I think they're hoping that people do buy into a social contract like maybe we can care about the we over me but I just you see people not doing that when they're pressed and that and that gets rough</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I'm pretty good thing about a month ago actually on the mats I was climbing on a guy's back was a good lesson for me to I was sleep over the top I got both of my hands involved and he rolled and snap my head into the mat and I didn't have a Chase planted and I didn't again I don't have s*** so I'm learning is a mistake that I haven't made since then but hooks in and was kind of just getting too involved in that traffic moving in the same thing the headache for a few days afterwards wild when they they try to get out of things not that's a particularly dangerous move when someone's on your back and you decided it's kind of a dick head move really what would have been okay if I had at least one post but like I said I was I wasn't thinking about that was me standing that he turned aliens turtled ending is tricky as f*** because they can just throw themselves backwards and on concrete or that's a game over it's a death sentence mean you're bi LG thought about that afterwards because you will see people who know I'm here because I want to learn to protect myself in the street and if I had done that on the street and had my head cracked on concrete and I have been waking up in the hospital or not at all you got to kick their legs out in those situations if you have someone's back and you're standing you got to you got to mean that the options that exist that don't exist in Jiu-Jitsu one of them is you kick their f****** legs out if you have someone's back you know you actually kick their leg you don't just just jump on them with the hooks in on concrete it's just too dangerous before you get to that position you you want to yank them and do something trip them do something to to get rid of their base but someone is strong that's so dangerous cuz someone is carry on their back and just throw themselves backwards me to hardwood floor anything or even against a building or a car to the ground or standing Guillotine front position so that's another one that's really f****** dangerous man with Guillotines I say guy shoots in with for a takedown and a guy grabs a guillotine pulls back and in this guy's head is the host of the wrong OK a guy on Team Alpha Male on Urijah Faber's team when it became paralyzed for life that way yeah in training in training shooting for the takedown and the guy gets 18 and they all all their weight together falls on this guy's head and his neck compresses in his neck breaks and he loses his his ability to move the rest of his life that's a common one in fact it's not common but it's happened multiple times and I'm aware of any imagine on the street you know someone tries to take you down on the street and you elevate and go into a guillotine position they fall down and slam if I can head first in your crack it open probably too yeah it's just there's so many I mean one thing that is a good criticism about you Jitsu is the lack of takedowns and that is a a real fact in any sort of real-world situation the hope is if you're in a bar or something like that there's a scramble most things wind up on the ground that's true until you deal with a skilled opponent and if you deal with a skilled opponent who has takedown defense and then you're stuck in the situation we're all right now you're in a realm where you're a white belt and this guy's a black belt like if someone is a problem wrestler who can strike a terrible position to be in and we saw that with a lot of in the early UFC a lot of Jiu-Jitsu black belts just didn't have takedowns and then they would get involved the wrestler would easily stuff their take down and the rest was a better Striker and those guys got f***** up yet imagine. It's not good I mean the only thing a lot of guys did their back and try to pull guard and try to entice a guy into coming to their back and then they would kick off their back like those Hixson use those those tactics when he fought punakaiki by kicking out his knee hyperextending is Nephi School rugged yeah that's a common common technique you know a guy standing over you and your on your back posting up you hyperextend Disney it's just like Jude always the best at my opinion for someone who's wearing clothes you know I think every Jiu-Jitsu guy would really greatly benefit from having a good comprehensive knowledge of of Judo how deep would you go to a good thing to learn magic. Fresno Kaiser so freaky chimp strong some of the freakiest champ strong guys ever roll with what you do people cuz you know players mad they're just all everything is to constantly this they're constantly grabbing it. Everything is a human body explosive moving like sandbag training with another 200 pound person all the time or or larger women like Ronda Rousey strong that woman is freakishly strong because she her whole body was designed to you know throw bodies around through a human body made it's like weightlifting right like when are you ever weight lifting your whole body well maybe if you're squatting or maybe your bench pressing if you accept was drunk or deadlifting advisable to do that with her whole body and your whole body weight is way more difficult to control cuz it's moving and resisting and if it's no try picking up a dead body or person who's out cold it's f****** hard you going to a person your wiggle I had to pick up a dude is 195 lb and I'll pick him up and he's out cold that's hard that person also resisting you know it's like they're some of the freakiest strongest people in the world just sit down when I start with you do people that really work with you and whose technique oriented not someone who just wants you to spot all the time cuz things that happened with Jude a lot when people are just getting involved in that there is a lot of scrambling on the feet that could put your legs in a compromised position weenie blows out how much your time watching the UFC how many of the takedowns UCR Judah based it's not that often but some guys are really good at it and the guys that are really good at it comes up you know there's there's there's some guys back when Karo parisyan was fighting Caro was a great judo player who is it in the early earlier days the successful UFC was one of the better Judo guys and he would hit he would hit hip tosses and all kinds of different judo throws all the time and Rhonda of course you would do it all the time too but with Rhonda that was basically the only way she would take you down with with like upper body grab should grab shoot her moves like to grab with grab the head and then take people down with that Andy and Yu's Judo but it does happen it but it only happened you know what happens with Sky grass shoot her moves like to grab with grab the head and then take people down with that in the end used you do but it does happen it but it only happened you know what happens with skilled players but it wouldn't when it does happen it's like it's a it's a big surprise often times like whoa</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> the numbers right to hospitalizations Intensive Care Unit admission case-by-case fatality percentage is reported for covid-19 by 18 covid-19 by age group so this is up until March 16th which is a couple days ago so 0 2 1923 cases 1.6 to 2.5 or hospitalized 0 ICU zerofatality so then you get 2244 that's U7 five cases 14.3 to 20.8 hospitalizations 224 ICU and 0.1 20.2 case-fatality you got to think those people pre-existing conditions just looking at those numbers 45 to 54 that's my age group 429 cases less for some weird reason 21 to 28 hospitalization 5.4 to 10.4 Isis 1.4 to 2.6 fatality again you got to thank those people pre-existing conditions and it gets all the way up to really old let's go to 85 + is Callens age that's count 844 Hospital 144 cases 31 out of 144 270 hospitals HR 31.3 to 7.3 hospitalization 62209 ICU fatalities 10 to 20 the vast majority of fatalities you looking at people between 75 and 84 which is 4.3 to 10.5 and then 85 + which is 10.4 to 20 7.3 so it's obviously not good for really old people it looks like you got a 25% fatality rate at the worst case scenario for hospitalized people that have the case but again for young healthy people it's not what it's being it's not it's not the big monster that everybody thinks it is I mean there's a people running around terrified that are young and healthy well then there's no concern is older folks Spectrum to their is the young people running around terrified and healthy and then there's the people who are mobbing beaches in Florida on spring break saying inaccurate but I would imagine the number because of the lack of testing but there's percentages are probably still the same you know I think there's probably bigger numbers yeah but kids are just going to be kids man you get 18 year olds on the beach in Florida there they're not worried about catching the covid-19 that is their brains aren't even form yet yeah my nine-year-old says they have monkey brains I'll try to explain to the 90 what are the development of the frontal lobe is and I'm like you know cuz you were just talking about I like I talk to my kids like their kids but also talk to them like they're adults I do the same thing that I I lay things out and then I explained so I lay things out like Adelaide to an adult and then I'm like your frontal lobe the part of your brain that makes the decisions and it's not fully developed you're 25 years old until you see the little nine-year-old brain spinning I go it's not really ready yet she said she's like so it's like squishy brain I go exactly 9 year old Dracula explain to my wife and then her and I had this little conversation about squishy brain and I'm like this is this with the frontal lobe is this is like when you see people that are young they're doing stupid things not even necessarily that they're stupid they're just acting it is there wild you know they're there their free their parents probably tell him what to do too much the school tells me what to do much their job tell them what to do too much and then they're out and have a couple f****** Miller High Life by the way we seen the coronavirus song yet Depot so that I so want to see it I want you to Jamie we can play it yeah I might have washed it fiber that's okay you're right but the gentleman who who made it these guys them at one of them reached out to me f***** up Reggie Baybee be2 and then there's a f****** Reggie Baybee e to_that's a fake account those comments and also I accidentally tagged the fake account at first but now I got the real f****** hoaxer who's pretending to be him the fake one is the one that has the underscore afternoon to those pieces of s*** that's the real dude Reggie baby about her mom you know which we should be and I'm concerned about my parents as well you know and more concerned that people are freaking out and it you know there's a lot of people around that have never been tested and they're not good under stress and this is a this is a very unusual stress because there's no clear answer not from the president not from the the doctors is not no one has a real clear answer of how to fix this when it can be fixed and when you hear things about like a vaccine will be available in 18 months it what will and if you continue reading that says if it is available in 18 months that would be three times faster than normal wow so that would be on the very front Leading Edge it would be possible to get in people's hands normal would be 3x that in osterholm who died was on the podcast really sparked a lot of people to take this very seriously there's excellent podcast by the way and that we are far too flippant about how we and if it's not there right in our face they don't allocate resources towards those kind of things I think are society's got a defined by its success and luxury yeah and when you live in that environment and I'm not saying it negatively at all but if you live in that environment if you never leave that environment if you don't bend yourself before the world ends of a little bit shift going to come off the rails when you get pressed itself I mean I have no over if I get the virus in how that plays itself out and I cannot control that but I can control my behavior and how I act and try to exude calm like when it comes to my kids are my family my friends and my Social Circle but yeah I wish I wish I hope that people on the other side of this because it's not going to be the end of the world but I hope on the other side gives them in it a greater understanding and appreciation in perspective of what we have how lucky we are and then just maybe to think about people what's the obesity rate in the US right now at 40% instead of allowing that access and you know luxury to Define you know how about that something you can control people in my experience to spend a lot of time energy and effort focusing on things that take not control and that is definitely one thing that I learned from my old job is that at some point you have to surrender the emotional and mental horsepower on the things that you can't control it only focus on the things that you can which is specifically yourself that you can't control what happens to you but you can control how you receive what happens to you and being scared allowing that to make the decision making process for you is what gets people in substantial trouble job sexy it can be quite terrifying and the number one rule of firefight if you get into a gunfight is to win but the first thing you need to do is you need to shoot back with overwhelming Firepower superiority and then you have to maneuver might have to pin your enemy in place when you have to maneuver but let's say that you get ambushed when you're on the receiving end of that and so you take any behind a wall and bullets are snapping over your head and you don't want to move because you're scared and you think I'm going to die so you have fear of death which is totally real and it can paralyzed people and instead of moving you sit there and other people maneuver around you that fear of death preventing you from doing the things that you had control over shooting back maneuvering coordinating with your team that fear paralyzes you and external circumstances with the Enemy that you're fighting maneuver around you and then they're going to end up killing it with the reason you didn't move is he allowed that emotion to take over your decision-making process you have to detach the two chocolate talks about it a lot and it's just reinforced consoling in training and in operations overseas and I'll be like that's if people ask what should I do when my biggest thing is just try to remain as objective as possible you see people freaking out that doesn't mean that you need to freak out and you don't know the way I've had it described me that made up a big influence on me in the way I think about things if you think about two circles like an archery target there's only two circles or the Bullet entering which is super small and then where are you when I need you with the big ring I guess it goes 10 9 8 out whatever the lowest scoring ring is that'll be the other ones you get two circles and the big circle is your circle of concern and the small circle is your circle of influence I see and the dangerous thing that I see often does people spending all their time with their energy and effort on the circle of concern what's going on in the stock market what's going on on Fox News what's going on on CNN Sharon back-and-forth things on but they're probably him have them aren't even true anyway no research put into it is there going to be enough toilet paper what do I do about this they don't have control over any of those things but that's the stuff that they're worried about and the only thing that you should spend your time energy and effort working on other things directly inside of your circle of influence and even decided that one there could be the circle of control and what do you have control over at all times the things that come out of your mouth how you behave whether or not you allow your emotions override your decision making process the way that you can whether or not you decide to work out as opposed to shoving 4000 excess calories in your face every single day you focus on those things and put your time energy and effort in there you're going to get through stressful situations just fine because you actually have more mental capacity because you're trimming off of the things you can't control the thing about things you can't control those some people or their they're thinking that this is one of those things that if you were a paranoid person and you Captain worried about the future you would have already stockpiled enough food and toilet paper and ammo and all these different things so that you were ready for this where his people they were just concentrating on day-to-day life didn't act didn't think a balance between I mean is it reasonable for everybody to have 5 years of food at their house stockpiled enough food and toilet paper and ammo and all these different things so that you were ready for this where his people that were just concentrating on day-to-day life didn't act didn't think a balance between I mean is it reasonable for everybody to have 5 years of food at their house</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you're a sociopath and then they're out there they are out there a few I went to I went through bus with a sociopath leaving on her man with my buds class is still in jail for chopping people up and then disposing of their bodies with his wife back from at least once and might have had multiple times but they would go to bars find a couple continue the after party afterwards elicit an argument some type of exchange they killed I believe as a man and woman chop them up he used to work at a grocery store chain so he knew the day the very cyclical removing of the garbage cans are they got 10% of the landfill more often so we dispose of the body bodies in multiple restore garbage dumpsters and then they eventually got caught because in the middle of the night they broke into a Hooters to steal t-shirts and got caught by the cops and I believe it was in her purse they found a Spyderco knife with like hair and like basically tissues still on the knife I think the woman's ID high-level criminal it really thought this one through yeah of course you will. Why the f*** are you breaking into Hooters screens your knife you dirty b**** but again so this is a sociopath's out there and in this is another thing that I try to tell people off in the best people that I ever was around my entire life was in The Shield community and my mortal enemies in the worst people I've ever seen on the face of the Earth was in the seal Community as well he was the honor man in my bud class which if I look back if he had he had passed more Evolutions from a statistical perspective than anybody else in the class they weren't Act viewing him through the lens of is this person honorable or does he know they weren't grading and by his Integrity but it just goes to show you that no selection process is perfect and if you can't separate an individual from an occupation or a uniform or a black belt right if you think that because you have a black belt that you're going to be an awesome person or because somebody to seal that are going to be a great person stand f***** by and it's not the norm but I'm not I'm not I don't want him as the anomaly to paint the norm but it's important for people to remember that those people are out there and again they can leverage from my back when they can leverage the fascination curiosity people wanted to give back your most common questions that I get from people as you know how can I thank people for their service and we both a just say thank you and then am I answer them as be as you know provide him an opportunity if you feel it's necessary but don't allow them don't do anything for them and don't give them any special treatment make him earn it because then you can get a true look at the individual as opposed to perhaps just a shiny object but you were focusing on before so treat them as an individual thank them but treat them as if it is as an individual and judge them based on the merits of their behavior and there were one-hundred-percent not real thin there it's their background if you have a job you know you okay I want to provide opportunities for veterans no problem provide the opportunities for veterans but treat them exactly like the person who is in the cubicle next to him if it's in that environment obviously if you hold the person that was a non veteran to a certain Stan you better hold it back into the same standard don't let him get away with anything because it doesn't help them either you know it it it helps everybody in the organization if you set the standard and make sure everybody hold it it's Insidious to an organization to set a standard and why is this guy get special treatment seal and if that person is sociopathic or they are you know there's a bell curve there's a top 10% in the the top in the bottom 10% of his net bottom 10% by holding to that standard you're going to get an objective Viewpoint of that as opposed to just being blinded by whatever baby it's interesting but only you can say that or someone in your position can say that it's very difficult for someone is a non veteran to say anything remotely close to that will help they listen then because they don't need to say that they just need to if they needed to live that they need to structure their organization with that framework so its objective not subjective dislike people look at being a CEO it's not a Harry Potter wand I have probably at familiarity and comfort with weapons and tactics more than your average person but if I'm being completely honest about my old job I could teach a monkey to do most of the things that I did I'm serious I could teach a monkey to do the things that we did is not we're not out there doing you're out there doing you know we find an individual how are we going to get there okay let's figure it out when you get there the standards we get on target everything is based on tactics and standard operating procedures are ttp's tactics techniques and procedures and everybody is trained of those standards so you know what to expect from somebody whether they're from the East Coast team or a West Coast team you can meet in the middle and we are taught to clear rooms the same way and it's just it's it's not complicated actually the blade of make us less effective and efficient would be to make it complicated the simpler that you can make it. that makes sense I mean it makes but it's also the mind of a seal like the type of person that can get through buds that's that's complicated that's complicated than just being able to control your mind you know one of the things that you said in one of the more times you talked about it was someone who's able to keep their world small Utah small exit people that applies to what's happening right now too so what you're talking about you know buds is a physical test actually I would say haven't gone back as an instructor which I learned much more about the process applying the curriculum as opposed to going through it because as a student you just like her as an instructor I can look at the entire curriculum in the story arc of where you start on day one and the product you're going to get at the end it's a physical test but we're using the body to test the mind we're stressing the body we're going to make you tired hungry hypothermic we're going to get you so exhausted the point that you're going to hallucinate and we're going to take a look at how you behave do you value we over me know one of the first things they do in buds your explain the concept of the swim buddy and you don't get to go anywhere farther than 6 feet away from another human being for that 6-month time. that is the opposite of most people's mentality and you can test it really on you yell at him you said hey you got 30 seconds to go to run out to the ocean and get wet and in the first few days they just take off and they start running because they forgot about this one but either me Centric and so you bring them back and you punish them the individual that made that choice and then also this one buddy you know to reinforce that people there are consequences to other people from your behaviors and after about two weeks you really can't separate people from their swing by so it's a and then it should have been getting point where you can instill this philosophy of we is greater than me just one of the most beautiful things I think from the seal Community if you talk to people or my experience has been as in talking to people in their most dire moments where things are getting the worst are often more concerned about the people to their left and right than they are about themself my biggest fear probably I know it was in the seal Community but to this day is that I am not going to be there when somebody needs me why was my biggest fear in the seal community that I was live up to the standard of the people to the left and right held at me and that they were going to suffer for it I was more concerned about letting them down to myself getting hurt or killed and that starts with that ethos from SEAL training but it's not a complicated course we're stressing the body to stress the mind and if you look at the people who make it through so when I went back as an instructor as a student when you're going through training if somebody next to you quit so you never see them again but there's no hey dude what the f*** are you doing like they're just gone can you continue on with your day because you just want to graduate program as an instructor you can talk to those people and you can ask really important questions my favorite question is why you said you this was your lifelong goal this is all you've ever wanted to do you left a D1 scholarship to come here because you saw no for yourself no value in higher education and he wanted to come to the zoo with me didn't you quit why time and time and time again and try would get from the students as they got over with so they were doing the opposite of keeping their world small cuz there's two ways you can look at Bud's its 180 days long and then plus or minus one or two or you can look at it as a sunrise and a sunset hundred eighty times so you can look at pie and go oh my God I have to eat this whole thing where you can look at a slice and eat the slice and not worry about the rest of the slices and keep doing that and doing that until the training process is complete hell week is another good example of start Sunday in the evening and ends Friday in the Community about 2 hours of sleep on Wednesday that's it it's horrendous to go through and it's pretty entertaining as an instructor cuz you can totally f*** with the students cuz they're off their rocker by Tuesday afternoon but almost all of the attrition occurs from Sunday night until I'd say Tuesday morning and beyond that you're probably going to make it through cuz you've invested so much but the advice that I was given when I went through was don't look at how weak as a 5-day pipeline just make it to your next meal they have to feed you ever so if I can stack 6 hours on 6 hours and 6 hours and just focus on getting to the next meal doesn't matter how much I'm in pain doesn't matter how cold am if I can just get to the next meal or get a reprieve a mental reset and I can continue on that's that in combination with some you know the mental toughness is how you approach and set your goals and then resilience in my definition of resilience will be the ability to get bent and come back when you were before the way you do that is by bending yourself as often as possible which you do all the time by running Sprints or you don't mean that you're doing that stuff you're mentally tough because of that and if you can apply that resilience to approaching setting an approaching your goals from digestible perspectives you can accomplish insane amount so that's really what I mean it's a physical test or just testing the mind can the individual ignore the big and focus on the small can you do the step that you need to do and knock it over regardless if you're tired exhausted hungry cold and that's really all it is it's not a complex training program that there's the ocean there's the beach there's some telephone poles are some boats and then later on WE introduce scuba gear and towards the tail end of it that you know some Demolition and pistol and rifle how many days can you stay awake for where it becomes dangerous to your health I don't know it's dangerous for their health in hell week is there's a huge safety Network for them you don't see it as a student because you're so just task saturated there are MD's walking around all over the place that people constantly know we're checking the temperature of the water will take core body temperature is on the students were keeping a very good eye and we're bothering them because by about Wednesday they're brain-dead I don't know how long you can stay awake without suffering from severe physical consequences of sleep in the whole week on the wall at the bus compound it pays to be a winner and the inverse of that is incredibly true it does not pay to be a loser in the seal community in for clarity loser as anything other than first place in the community that I came from the podium has one platform not the great so if you win you might get 15 minutes off of work hammering the s*** out of the rest of class Bud's hell week boat crew race MLB students running with boats on their heads and people get bald spots from it and what do you race is like a take that boat that's supposed to be in the ocean and you're going to run with on your head as a crew of seven people three people on each side and the leader in the back and the end of four miles will be done with this boat crew will break and then losing boat cruise will get remediated for my yep there you got that neck on that front right guy this later on in life will do long ones and small but still probably 150 200 pounds and then go out past the flip the boat over for no reason other than it's difficult and forces him to get wet right the boat come back in continue the race but you might get you know 15 minutes while we're meeting in the class and we know what's going to happen at 15 minutes you see people sleeping standing up you see people space down and hi-lift track in the sand sleeping they're sitting there sleeping and it's kind of just a reward he just leave me alone for 15 minutes ocean wow five days of that and it took about people in that you learn a lot and you see people push to the point where do you care about me over week and we get rid of the people who cannot prioritize we over me arrogance comes out you see the light in the the leadership as well you know the students are largely the Same by from a physiological perspective there's ones that are faster Runners and promote contractile potential like stamina or a cardiorespiratory endurance but most of them are the same percent difference between the students but these little PODS of 7 people some of them can work together and they're just crushing it in other ones you'll see the other whores in the boat so when they run their stuff on the top and you'll see he'll be out paddling and then do the see a sword fight start with people knocking each other's heads off with oars do suppressed is a human being like from all the physical tools that we have that the real person comes out and sometimes boat cruise will just hit Jake Tapper snail hate that person so much because of their they might be selfish or arrogant or they're not pulling their weight and they will just harp on that person or beat the s*** out of person eventually they'll end up quitting now when they do get in a swordfight what do you do do you kick them out if they get in sword fight should you let them sort it out. now when they do get in a swordfight what do you do do you kick them out if they get in sword fight so you let them sort it out I'm 11 sort it out</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> that's one of the things like you really have to get into those valleys to appreciate to really hit those Peaks I think that's what's going on right now as you're saying that I'm thinking about like literally what's happening in this country and I hope that you know we get to the point where we see the sun and we do it but then we have to also not forget I think you're 100% right I think we have a really really easy in this country what you were saying about this is the reality of third world countries or places where me and you're under a military dictatorship can't get food you can't travel wherever you want to you don't have the freedom to move about whenever you want to and we're in a weird situation here today in California they put this lock down on everybody we're supposedly until April 19th you can't have a gathering more than 10 people and you're all essential businesses are supposed to be closed like a f****** good luck with that Goodluck Goodluck Goodluck with a whole month of work is crazy stuck with me that I use as like a lens of context from overseas news from Afghanistan I was in a sniper OverWatch position and I was watching a little one side of the valley there's a unit on the other side of the valley and there was a village in between and I watched an individual come out in the morning to the only water source in the valley small stream and watch him just take a s*** in the water and then the day another person came out and downstream of that took a bath in the water and later on in the day a woman came out with two kids and got their drinking water Downstream from both of those things and went back to their house and it's like okay we have it really really good really really really really good in that Village there was probably a light bulb why did you take a s*** in the river yeah I mean that's the thing about people that's the willingness to do something that you know is going to negatively impact others but you don't care because in the moment it's good for you when you see someone throwing a cigarette out the window of the car that's a perfect example that they don't want that cigarette in their car so they just saw somebody else will handle it but if you see enough of those things are in that it reframes the way that you look at what people complain about and about that day very often because it in that short period of time it's just like why don't ever really have that much to complain about what's going to go on right now for the next few months I would guess maybe the rest of yours going to be horrendous and I hope that everybody makes it out okay on the other side but the reality is people going to die and it's going to stalk and it's going to destroy families and then the economic destruction will probably be worse than the physical destruction from the death side of the house but we're still going to be okay the end of that and even as if it gets horrendous here we are doing so much better than so many other people on the face of this Earth their daily best is not going to even approach what it's going to look like at our worst as we navigate our way through this my biggest concern is not just the deaths which is a big concern not just the financial crisis which is also a big concern but it's also the government gobbling up freedoms in in exchange for the illusion of safety that's a real concern for a long yeah but it's it's also whenever there's a real crisis there's always an excuse to pass legislation that diminishes our rights made sister it's makes it easier for them makes it easier for them to do what they perceived to be their job only if people are scared it's no because they're finding the seams in people's attention span there instead of being objective they're being emotional and that clouds your vision in a cloud your judgment and when they're not paying attention because they're scared because they're online day looking at people taking pictures of the empty toilet paper aisle in the grocery store other people who might have malicious intent or moving on that men and nobody's paying attention to it yeah that's where a lot of people the more what's the best way to say I'm trying not to use the word retarded conspiratorially minded that don't think very well their first run was accurate people take advantage of moments if that's the difference that's what really happens when there's moments where they pass something like the Patriot Act of the Patriot Act to they do it it's not because they've set this up to the pass that know that use it as an opportunity because they know the people are scared and they use it as an opportunity to further diminish our rights cuz it makes it easier for them to control us and that's over that's a real concern right now it's a real concern right now and it's something people last thing you should be thinking about know it's one of the things you should be thinking about there's many things you should be thinking about right now besides your safety in your house and not spreading a disease and make sure you wash your hands and stay away from old people and maintain social distance all that stuff is important but also recognize what the f*** these career politicians and these is career lawmakers needs career people that are in in charge of controlling Mass groups of people at any laws that help you with any it said help you it makes their job more difficult they have something to be concerned with right now I didn't fear is totally natural I stink if you don't experience fear you might Trend towards the sociopathic side of the spectrum but it's totally natural should be expected but you have a choice and how you receive what is going on and you can allow the sphere to Cloud your judgment and drive your decision-making process for you can can recognize that the fear of something you know fear of death overseas fear of death overseas on what keeps you alive objective analytical thought process in doing the things that need to be done keep you alive regardless of how scared you are or fearful you are that's what keeps you alive it's okay to be scared but just don't let it just don't let it take over and control you</div>

Chomp that's not a good idea but everyone's going to go hey you could have done this the whole time that's right people money can just give people more money and if I'm not saying we should do this but give people more money support their family that's on the right start on fire they know that it's like a bribe to try to keep people from rioting until whatever the f*** is bacon past or giving people a different environment to exist in one that doesn't leave them hostile if you could just get by and then you could pursue other things would that be better for society and that was like what Andrew Yang was suggesting if this whole automation Revolution took place and everything started getting automated and no one had a job anymore. There might be something to that there might be something that now even you know they're the question is like what are what are you happy you're your taxes get used for you know you sure that's almost like you should be able to vote on that like the one thing that we don't get real Direction on right like in terms of like with with the country actually want but if we could all just individually vote on things like that like where's where's my taxes go to education and you know what to do with the rest of the money Murray's how are the salaries of politicians private jets dress rehearsal is a dress rehearsal for people going to become Preppers it is going to be amazing for the toilet paper in the street they're going to they're going to experience a banner year if it got toilet paper stock you riding high right now do you remember that I don't know if you if you had this experience but like I can remember sitting at my computer and pressing the button on Amazon where I wanted to buy something and it's like this isn't available right now it's my birthday bracelet things it didn't like suddenly just realized oh my f****** God how completely week if I become that I got accustomed to pressing this button and people with bring groceries to my house and now they don't now it's like stop and pick up some food always been there it's not there dude I have an instacart delivery today you do cuz we wanted to get stock up on food $200 worth of food guess what I got strawberries hummus and I think we got like I don't know some like eggs that's it send everybody $2,000 a month but what are they going to buy if there's like no food on the shelves like what why you think that was a temporary freak out with people stockpiled stuff and I think as long as food keeps getting delivered on a normal schedule I think that'll normal out so fragile they're so vulnerable like it's an emergency happens and everyone wants to call it once the cell phone system can handle it like it's not like you have a phone and you can call anytime you want and I have a phone I can call anytime I want and everyone in the world is a phone they can call anytime they want know if everybody does that the system is not set up to handle that make phone calls yeah he's not going to get through yeah dude I just heard on NPR that so many people requesting unemployment that it's crashed systems in several States what what happens now when there's no food on the shelves to help them text message thread with Whitney Cummings and Nick Swardson and crystalia were talking about that very thing right now I kind of do it and how to set up a fund and needs to be done for sure you know people that can help should help this is not a normal time does not a time where people are lazy this is a time where the whole world got f***** real quick right now I got to do it and how to set up a fund it needs to be done for sure you know people that can help should help this is not a normal time does not a time where people are lazy this is a time where the whole world got f***** real quick and we're going to have to come together</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> but this is a good time for people to recognize the importance of community it's a terrible time for Humanity is a terrible time for us and terrible time for the people that are sick but it's a really good time for us to understand why communities important we live in this illusionary world this provided to us by the culture that we've created where you can just buy things anytime you want you don't need people to come home you watch Netflix you don't engage with anyone to get in your car you barely say hi to anybody at work or detached from each other and this is the only time ever in life we've been detach me to the number being detached by these goddamn Electronics yeah is sneaking up on us yeah electronics and cars which is also you know today it's also a creation of mechanical creation and now more than ever they're driving computers yeah man it's true like trying to watch the worst thing I'd like a Charles Manson Kaczynski and yeah it is who you know it is a little bit like kind of interesting Lee not that is so Imperial or something when you're reading it I like you all over LA and what they do they post people post s*** they need so like one of the moms just had to get if they don't have any wet wipes and so then all the other moms but we've got wet wipes and then right now they're just leaving them on the door so people come and get him so it's like I think the community thing is exactly right I need what do I have and then start some form of like trade or just giving people you know there was someone he set up a toilet paper exchange I don't know where are you then you got to help them and this is you know this is a weird time for us but it's a time for us to reset you know it's not it's not good I'm not saying it's good but I'm saying there's a we can get a positive out of this people that make through the people that make it through we can get a positive out of this in the positive is communities important is really important and it seems like it wasn't important cuz it seems like we had everything set up so you didn't have to engage with people it's not the right way to do it it's not good for anybody now that kind of life is not good in the Detachment that we had me that's why why do you think people have road rage on the highway you know when they're they're blocked in a little box operated from people in a way that they believe but they wouldn't have it in person it was just a piece of metal and glass separating from these people visit the other added factor of the heightened senses because of driving fast you realize you might have to make quick movements so dumb things people do for elevated and her even the more dumb you're you're in these boxes right it's like a weird dream with some weird s*** to each other yeah because of that we're all gummed up in that way it's like something it's like it's like a fungus that grew on the circuitry of society and start to communicate with each other sonar it is completely made us disconnected from the earth essentially like our Earth connection has been replaced by a technological connection of Technology about secondary things compared to your feet touching the ground being around when people when you're with someone I know I don't know if you ever done that but just like the next time you're around anybody that you're like buying ship from or that you don't normally just kind of go by feel like that can that you can feel it there's an energetic connection that you can feel their that's easy to overlook yeah we lost the biggest one which is through light pollution I think every night people were humbled and reminded of the Majesty of the universe when they looked up and saw the infants guy clear night half the infinite Stars just the whole Milky Way you can see the whole thing yeah you know when there's parts of the country where there's plenty of darkness and you could literally see the whole Milky Way and it makes you think like all our ancestors saw this f****** freaky s*** all the time we decided to shut off the greatest art the world has ever known because we want to be able to see better at night the greatest art and art that literally not not just his inspired science and one 2N fueled right but also as as kind of always put people in place always just just understand this is not a backdrops not a tapestry that up there is madness it's forever and you're not protected there's just a thin layer of gas between you and the universe which is infinitely your this tiny little speck of nothingness in this impossible to understand expanse of planets and stars it just goes on forever really forever and one little tiny piece of it and we're being held here with a spin and some are and there's a giant f****** Fireball in the sky to Keep Us Alive it's a million times bigger than it is almost too crazy to put in your cyst on a daily basis so we forget about it all the time it's the one of the most important things about our existence here as it were a part of the universe yeah it's not just at work in you know f****** Sherman Oaks or we're hanging out in Montana nut were right there connected in the universe and it doesn't get brought up in one of the reasons we don't see it we don't f****** freak out if you go to the country camping you f****** freak out you like me nachtmann to see him all it's it's a reset but the changes how you feel about life yeah yeah also seems like a lot of us have forgotten that we're going to die on top of all that I mean looking up at this void filled with stars but the thing you are is a temporary and that to me is I feel so lucky to be washing dishes right now I'm alive I'm healthy as f****** it with a different kind of washing dishes than a week ago when I was able to or two weeks or for the s*** started when I can order anything I f****** wanted off the internet I'm in a different world like this is the world a my house right now I don't know what this s*** is so it's like suddenly these are what you're experiencing is this kind of like what was it say in the Bible that we both loved so much fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and I think you could easily translate that to understanding your place in the universe should produce a kind of positive fear and trembling this doesn't last nothing about this last and right now everyone around the planet is getting a first-hand glimpse of that very truth right and now we know it going to and now we know it hey look this is a this is a terrible thing but relatively speaking compared to supervolcano asteroid impact compared to something solar flare something really crazy that can happen and blow out all the power which is 100% of possibility solar flares are 100% a possibility and four people did not recognize that and it just go through the life it's just because we we we look at life as if what we've experienced while we're alive is the norm but it's not it's not the norm it's just hard for you to recognize that your life is so short you life is so short that when they're measuring all the different catastrophes that have happened over the Earth with her it's proven sites of asteroid impacts are proven sites of volcano eruptions are all these different things that have happened for sure and wiped out millions of people all over the world happen over time span that's too big or head doesn't get in there or had doesn't go with what is 3013 thousand years is just some scratches on some paper in my head my stupid head and I don't know what 13,000 years means I can't I can't do it but 13,000 years ago they think and there's more and more evidence everyday that there was some big impact on Earth and who f****** knows how many of those humans have gone through who knows the scientist believe with what is it it's like 300000 + years we've been this isn't the idea Homosapien that's so short just in the time that the Earth has been here in the four point whatever billion years the earth has been here and that's so short in terms of the almost 14 billion year the known universe has been here all of its Madness every single step along the way is mad but we get stuck and he's little time. We're nothing changes and so we think that this is life so we built all these houses that only can work on electricity how many f****** people have a real fireplace in their house that live in cold places here and banning those now a hundred years Industrial Revolution The Roaring Twenties from from Den to today everyday is so dumb it's especially to say with in terms of the earth natural disasters space anomalies likes things that happened all the dad in the universe we don't know that there isn't something called like a quad treezy and ripple it happens every 16 million years is my name is Ozymandias ruler of rulers King of Kings behold my Works ye Mighty and despair all or remember me for a long time we don't know who you are it's all gone eradicated wiped out and this to me is like one of the really side effects of this thing this technology thing is we've all become completely self-obsessed self-absorbed out there making sure there are profiles are updated making you know what I mean like we have this idea of they were all the only way that we can finally see how connected we are is something motherfuker eats a bat you know what I mean really did have an effect on the programming of human beings in a few beings interacting with technology think we're internet and innocently in Iraq with a non-sentient thing but all the while this technology and you could call take the week we get confused with him to technology is like a digital clock or television or computer it is but it's also like a fishhook right like so that the Sony is innovation so he figured that out and imagine creating an ape that is aware of its environment like this is like the perfect storm but obsessed with itself nose in the back of its head that it's it's temporary but it's it's it's got a finite life-span but lives like it's going to live forever and lives in the moment there's in the moment and want to acquire things I can see who's the number one goal for the you know the uber wealthy or the Uber successful the Jeff Bezos types of characters right or the top of the food chain financially choir sings throes acquiring things which means people to make things which means there's a big consumer as well as as someone who's is making a s*** ton of money right and this also fuels Innovation cuz you have to keep up with these people going to keep giving them bigger and better things every year so it innovation of Technology 150 megapixel camera or Euro loser loser Samsung phone 7 inch screens now everyone's going crazy what is the Gold Coast to make better s*** and the go along the way I like this girl is it's working but you know be even better if we made it so they don't touch each other anymore and week maybe we could come up with a disease we can't shake hands they don't they don't come close or Ryan yeah just keep them a little further apart from each other more interested in the things more interested in the technology more more separate from each other and encourage technology that connects them with each other so through technology you find this human longing for contacted Debra Messing in their life they going to get an emulated version of it but that emulated version of is just going to keep getting better and it's going to keep getting better and it's going to get to a point where it's better than real life way better than real life cuz you like Jumanji you get to be the rock you know you get to be the like a superhero like you could you could live a magical life with no boundaries of physics and that they're going to do that people going to do that they going to give in if I was at a life-form that was trying to haunt another life-form and trick it into giving birth to me that's I would create a person I crave people we play some f****** Aunt we're like some aunt that manufacturing our successors one good thing of something like this anytime a tragedy happens people bond together afterwards it's a terrible thing that it happened but it's for the victims in the family members the victim's we all know this but it can be a good reset for Suriname going to have to get through it that's going to be the most difficult part yeah and I think there's there's going to be an opportunity for us to just assume a nicer stance towards our neighbors and towards our friends and towards our community and instead of embracing this idea like better get guns cuz they're coming maybe we can all come together for whether things are right or wrong in the news we need something to retune ourselves like right now we're tuning the guitar of our identities to these till like the most terrifying which is the news or like what people are saying and so many people become so accustomed to getting their idea what's happening in reality from the TV instead of from like how they feel inside what's going on with her engineer family that puts people incredible disadvantage because their Pond is being rippled by s*** you know I was thinking it's like one of those little prairie dogs Mizzou adorable adorable animals ever I remember when I was growing up in the old days when the news had an alert that was series some serious s*** with you you'll be what the f*** Fox News or any of the news stations to have an alert like every 4 minutes now start danger out here danger out here until we're all like even before this s*** we were huddled up a little bit now we can rationalize the huddling you know and that's what we're doing just huddling inside right now that's an incredibly vulnerable place to be I mean I'm not going to get conspiratorial here but</div>

Just been trying to figure out better ways of stab its neighbor with a spear get that thing and slowly infected with ideas ideas of a new stuff to make and then it goes out and does the work for you and then you take over the Earth the ideas of taking over the Earth just the toys the ideas now if instead of ideas you said demons I mean that's that's literally what people used to think was happening folks and I did terrible think they had bad ideas they acted on those bad ideas and ancient religions thought of those ideas like they were demons like these people were possessed there was a common thought that someone is possessed by demon swarms of idea what does he do look what he's done he's one guy that's probably had more of an impact on our perception of what the future holds in terms of Technology than any other one individual human being that is widely known of like he is a famous human like he is I mean he's doing Tesla which is the most advanced electric cars in the world are insane Denny's doing this f****** Loop thing right the hyper or the boring project was boring was in the hyperloop is doing the boring project making tunnels under LA and Vegas and going to be able to shoot through those tunnels 120 miles an hour jokes and ideas there's no Rhyme or Reason to why the what what they are is an antenna for ideas those ideas come at me like why I'm glad I thought of that and then you go to work on fracking to go to work all kinds of different crazy things that changed the world forever whoever invented Fukushima or that group of people whose ideas all coincided talk people into building a Chantix nuclear furnace you can never shut off how crazy is that that's crazy we have no way to scan human consciousness incoming IDF where was the idea was just floating in the astral plane gradually just shooting towards Hitler's is fueled by an ecosystem and fueled by nutrients right human beings are fueled by plants and fish and animals and vitamins and always everything's well these ideas are fuelled or fueled by insecurity and ego and lust and greed and jealousy and anger virtue in love and prosperity and Comfort Inn and community and all those different components of human consciousness all interactive this idea so the idea becomes like a just hitches a ride and hitches a ride with all these ideas that that already exists in your brain and then with these pre-existing structures like businesses and warehouses and all these different things that we use to make stuff and then ship it out then the idea becomes a thing and then the idea why it's up in the belly of a seagull because it fish whoops sorry your dad who did Seagal you couldn't figure out that's a bottle cap or not a fish and that this is this is how things change they don't just change because the people were blaming ourselves and it is definitely us that's doing the work but it's all coming out of ideas if we thought of ideas is a life force instead of thinking ideas like something you own something you hold even though you deserve credit for your ideas because your discipline to sit down cultivate these ideas accelerate the production of those ideas and exercise has the muscle through which those ideas come through focus and energy he deserve credit for it is not socialist way of looking at it but everybody that has an idea that's really good till tell you it's like it came out of nowhere like every great bit they've ever had a lightbulb goes off and you have the thought and it comes out of nowhere that's like most things that are really cool they kind of come out of nowhere I bet they've ever had a lightbulb goes off and you have the thought and it comes out of nowhere that's like most things that you write that are really cool that kind of came out of nowhere to sit there and then all sudden you think of things there an idea that you're wrestling you just catch him</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> it's a dress rehearsal for death I mean you're going to that's up to thing is is like that blink if you're an atheist what you do and I think there must be some like deep like a real blow out so I could do accession now I know a couple and those those are the most puzzling to me because the people have done like real blow-out mushroom sessions or blowout DMT sessions I always think that they would lie the door open to The Impossible because it is impossible and you experienced it's not like even if you were imagining it I couldn't imagine that so how am I imagining that I imagine something in such incredible Vivid color and in detail and her and knowledge and love and all these different things you experience in that state that state is otherworldly the fact that that is accessible at all I don't care if it's through a molecule or through a yoga session I don't care how it's accessible the fact that accessible it all leaves open to me the I don't know because I didn't know that that was a thing so once I've experienced out of my all this flat plane of existence that we take for granted that we think this is this is everything around this is the whole environment have to worry about for this might be just one f****** stage on the radio dial of experience right and up of Dimensions that are interacting with us we just don't have the senses to to TuneIn and when you can for me at least it leaves open the door for who the f*** knows who knows man I just the fact that that's a thing there's a okay so this is a trip this is very trippy so I got this book called The Tibetan yoga of dream and sleep when you think you're awake and when you're dreaming and so basically ideas there isn't much of a difference there's like right now you're dreaming this thing you call your human Incarnation is a dream and you know like when people are dying 50s are in the 30s Warehouse whatever their lifetime which means it when you're dying you're going to like spin through time to meaning that this could be you time right now spinning backwards essentially like what it's like to have nobody but still have this like this basically like your karma your identity disorder propelling you through and that's how you like it get your next Incarnation so we're just being run it's like running a simulation of a pandemic or or maybe this is the way that like an AI gets polished like maybe we're an AI That's being like polished and taught through this process of having a limited Incarnation you got to have that he's going to tell you need that to train the thing up so it takes it seriously you have to put the setting on Mortal then you got did maybe you just run a series of tests on the saying you know you start run this what is this what if we made what is it doing a pandemic and buy it I mean the sum total of all humans which is right now disconnected it's like a malfunctioning brain or not connecting did every single moment in an individual's life and in a planet the planets that wife of History could be looked at as a training or an upgrade at this could be an operating system upgrade this could be what an operating system upgrade looks like in the bio-computer that we exist in it looks like a f****** pandemic and that's what's happening right now is we're being like upgraded for some reason even though it's terrifying and obviously horrific you know we're being upgraded and when you anyway the whole point is man this thing that were in right now whether or not there's a God we just by Thinking Atheist gets to lean into the idea that when they close their eyes and breathe their last breath it stops and I just think that's a big gamble man that's I mean actually die when you get really sick you already start waking up into your next life you just wait you just like go through a weird dream like State call the Bardo where you Freak the freak out and then you're suddenly alive and another being completely oblivious to whatever your past incarnations were and not to or in right now so and then you're suddenly alive and another being completely oblivious to whatever your past incarnations were and not to Orion right now so you know I don't know if this is a great time for people to start looking at that in one and preparing for that</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> play stories magic what do you mean by that so we write a great book called High magic which is called it's a fantastic book on Magic is really the wrong word for religion that guy send it now cuz of Hollywood is like you know ladies riding around on brooms and ship it it just needs to be used to be like healing women who would like deliver babies and stuff but these are roots and you can follow back this branch of or Egypt ways of connecting with the universe that are ritualistic in nature but see mysterious do us because even though like if you want to see what it looks like just look at a Catholic mass you're looking at a ceremony it's C or G I guess you'd call it that is a magical ceremony where red gets converted into the flash of a God that you eat so that they're all wearing robes magic someone in the Catholic Church might tell you this isn't Magic this is me praying to the infinite and asking for forgiveness that's magic intelligence you're hoping from your connection with the Divine intelligence to produce some change in your own psychology in your own life and maybe create good fortune or whatever it is you're praying for healing whatever it maybe that's my so magic is that and that it's I'm not saying the Catholic Catholicism would necessarily be considered a branch of Magic by one of the things he said this interview is like if the Bible is one of the most powerful magical grimoires there is I mean if you really look in it there's all kinds of bizarre stuff it doesn't seem to make it on the Christian radio why are they saying why do they refer to themselves as a plurality when God stalking it's not like if when they're saying like why do we throw Adam and Eve out of the garden it's we if we don't do something about this they will become like us we there's a plurality that's being mention there and so what is that plurality of angels The Book of Ezekiel hyper dimensional beings I have some data set they want to bring to the world quite often depending on what book you're in it some terrifying prophecy about the end of the world it's coming but sometimes it's you know some message of Hope or some message of healing so you could say magic is a non-Christian oriented method for connecting with those various entities using ritual that's now I'm not saying by the way these beings exist or don't exist but you could say if you wanted to get like a psychological you could say that we have buried inside of us bits archetypes bits of the collective that are buried deep inside of us and that their ways to connect to these little fragments of the collective mind and you know many people know that have their own method for doing that one of them to do that might be doing a ritual and infirm moment allowing yourself to imagine that you're trying to talk to an extradimensional be Aleister Crowley famously did one of these rituals and contacted a but it looks like a grey alien Aleister Crowley's in the 89s overweight girl with large breasts adjusting her halter top look like man let's cut the s*** that's we're going to look like right when you when you see people that are Harry and and and brutish you we think of them as being like closer to prehistoric man right to see a guy covered in hair he looks more like a beast and when we see people that are thinner and some more slender to become more more a gentle version of people and we associate that often times the intelligence we associate associate intelligence with Frailty right we all do that when you see some some Super Genius Guy usually their frail anytime transport yourself from one planet to the other imagine what we've done with our stupid monkey brains now imagine it was 150% larger 150% more brain and then Incorporated all sorts of f****** Electronics to let you interface with space-time around you and all kinds of other wacky ways of communicating we couldn't even possibly imagine now just like people from the 18 hundreds could never possibly imagine cell phone this is the idea is like okay we're going to go there and sit when we get there the way we understand space time is going to be different than the way we understand it now so what that means is theoretically you could connect or communicate with a being that is outside of space-time which is a future version of us right now using like various methods DMT being one of the big ones on the planet right now but also using they're a little bit more precise because of DMT it's kind of like you're not really putting a GPS coordinates necessarily some people do with intention like a shaman will do it like with intention and I can let you know excuse me can you give me another bloody Mary I can stop you always do this she gets drunk says she's leaving I'm a f****** leave you Clarence I'm going to f****** leave you son of a b**** magic is like ridiculous on one level is it absolutely sounds and is on one level on another level is at the very least a creative technique so that you can sort of summon a dream state while you're awake with the intent of causing some change in the world around you using for a lot of people would be considered a non-standard what we'll just in terms of your perception of how you view the world you can alter that pretty radically I mean from someone who has an amazingly positive action versus someone has an amazingly negative perception you look at the results right over overwhelming benefit of being a positive person overwhelming there's something to thoughts and ideas that Propel you in a good way and differ having a good architecture having a good philosophy having a good operating manual for how you view the world and how you act and behave part of that to getting up at 4 in the morning that's what that is you looking forcing your ability to sort of dictate the positive aspects of your future you're deciding to take action in your bond with the with the way you interface with current reality stuck out Christmas God damn if you want to meet me here I'll meet you here we could do some 5 a.m. sessions I mean yeah I would love that</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you talk to her at the CDC. f****** interview ever of all the lights we didn't just miss it by like 5 minutes either we missed it by like 20 30 minutes at the airport and it was empty if you've never had a or provigil or Nuvigil isn't a real similar I don't remember which one I stay up all the time no that's what he go crazy that's you can use it for that like if you're a real crazy but like I know some people that use that s*** for writing the right on that chair and they feel like without it they don't feel like I have any energy sleeping for days at a time and go literally insane and somewhere in there they write really good stuff that's what you know Newsradio the Staffing Newsradio these to do that on purpose porcelain Paul Simms brilliant guy the guy who created Newsradio and he thought it would be a good idea to have a writing style fill with a bunch of psychos who were willing to play video games and stay up till 4 in the morning every night and I was like this mad Vagabond crew of writers assembled and they would play video games and just talk s*** and then they would start writing at like 2 a.m. sometimes but they would come up with these amazing script to the end scripture so ridiculous some of them were so ridiculous in this because they were Delirious whenever instead of doing drugs they were doing the drug of Stew staying awake dude this is for me I've disguised started doing this about six months ago or longer regardless of when I went to sleep I was having some insomnia and so I start I realize like s*** I'll just like wake up when I wake up and then wake me up 4 a.m. if you have insomnia that is going to cure your f****** insomnia because when night time rolls around you're exhausted but not only that 4 a.m. is like the great time for writing weird s*** still half-asleep and the stuff you write is it's like really feels like you're tripping you know especially waking up at 4 a.m. and then like eating weed I was doing that so you do eat weed first and then start writing system before the f****** apocalypse was and again I wasn't doing this every day if I did do it first because I got into David Goggins cuz I was at the gym not swear I'll drive you are there that early will know cuz it would open it I got there once before the gym open Savage no I didn't but then I went into the car and I like 30 minutes to blow and I'm f****** Stone man and I'm sitting there in the parking garage the goddamn Hollywood Equinox now let me tell you something man that area of Hollywood is already f****** weird I'm sitting there with my eyes closed kind of tripping feel like I'm half asleep half awake I look over there two dudes creeping up to my car window creeping up there and I'm like what the f*** I'm driving through the parking garage stoned definitely walking up to my car I'm like tripping like what the f*** f*** f*** I'm not going to work out until I leave I'm like what the f*** I'm going to let these two like 4 a.m. weird vampire stop me from working out so I drive back in one of them's like leaning up against a pillar like just staring at me creepy breaking right that's what it look for a m people that are out on meth and they know that this is assholes like to go to the gym and leave their s*** in their car I dare you got there you go it was terrifying but you know 4 to 5 a.m. is the funniest mix of people I'm going to write because that's when like I mean this is a new idea feel free to like that s*** again but like there's a there's an idea of Prana which is like energy in in there's more energy in the morning then there is at night so if you get up at 4 you're getting like that the purest most amount of this s*** so that's why a lot of people meditate it really early why like a lot of monks get up really early is because like it's now it's just a very it's the most psychedelic. I'm way more psychedelic then like midnight exerting some form of control over your life and usually it says go time or something along those lines discipline like my friend Jack always says discipline equals Freedom he gets up every morning for 30 photo of his watch on Instagram and usually says go time or something along those lines</div>

Convection you're being drawn into the Divine mine is it is that happens that s*** that looks like austerity when you're like further away begins to actually just be a natural way that you act you just become naturally more graceful naturally less inclined to do shity things naturally more tuned in with like the hundred fifty year old version of you you know that that he sort of naturally it's naturally more tuned in with like the hundred fifty year old version of you you know that that he sort of naturally and that just happens on its own cuz you were being infected into the Christ sucked into the Omega point the divine</div>

And discipline that you need to know to be able to study and actually Implement their technology so I think he was a genius and he was probably Visionary that way like Elon has he had an extra large magnet for ideas yeah yeah strongman I'm so glad anytime you give me weed I'm always forget how strong it is and every time I got to be careful. I think so yeah absolutely</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> all right this thing Netflix I told him I just called mint it's called The Midnight gospel the midnight gospel with Duncan Trussell in Pendleton Ward the guy who made Adventure do you know that is he was like in the group of kids who got accused of murdering someone in the woods there's a whole know oh yeah there's like a whole documentary about him I think HBO it's like basically executed he's on death row studying Zen Buddhism like Zen priest was working with him to like basically like it you know preparing for his you know soon as he was badly beaten on death row he was almost executed then he was exonerated before we start this does he get do they have to pay him the great question I think maybe part of it that they may not want to say cuz I've no idea well I know a man is going to cost you your life really didn't do it eventually that makes its way to the United States through the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn which was the order that Curly was a member of before you know when off to the Oto you had MacGregor Mathers Dion Fortune the poet WB Yeats all these people were members of the Golden Dawn that's how this current makes its way to the US and that's my last offer all right it taken place out of my minnows mouth but fine forward is send them over really really really cool to get the dick just taking a combination of your podcast and then some interstitial stuff that like that you is like scripted where people use Multiverse simulators to simulate universes so that they go inside and harvested and sell it and so my character has a malfunctioning used Multiverse simulator that isn't really working to produce technology and because it's malfunctioning every single world and it is going through some kind of Apocalypse until my character goes into his simulator and interviews people and they were in the Dying World what can happen if people are going to do podcast people are going to still have conversations so these conversations we just set them in these surreal universes where schitts melting down and you know where like Clancy meets these various people kind of learned from them within crazy as you started this whole long time ago and it's coming to fruition right when the apocalypse hits yeah I mean it's like it it's almost like it's almost like you knew someone like you had a type and then the universe was like this is a perfect time for Duncan s*** to come out and what's inside it I mean look at just look at how bizarre your show is strange and then the fact that it's a hybrid of podcast conversations and then written stuff so strange I think it is a perfect time for it and I hope I could some of the like every guess we was we chose for this they all had this like really like amazing thing to say like echoes in this episode one of the things he says you know I asked him like do you feel like you kind of like we're blessed that you ended up in solitary confinement in this when he's he says like I feel luckier than some Millennials out there right now who are like completely disconnected cuz that's the coolest thing about him as you would expect a person who's been on death row to be bitter sweetest most genuine wonderful person ever and it's like whatever went on in the situation of being on the brink of the Abyss where is about to get murdered by the state somebody didn't do something about that didn't turn him into someone who is like Shell Shocked or angry but like really turned him into like someone very compassionate and I guess grateful for his life you know not to me like it's not bitter after being on death row for something you didn't do and like getting physically assaulted wondering every day if you were going to die if what you can still maintain an attitude of service or contribution to society in some way or another than any of us can any of us can you know like any of his can I think that's from the show end of the world right now especially man cerveza contribution to society in some way or another than any of us can any of us can you know like any of his kin to me that's like I think that's I hope some of that stuff from the show end of the world right now especially man</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I would think that for a guy like you who's building cars away your building on the real challenge would be staff I think that would be the real challenge is finding people to understand what you're doing finding fellow Artisans that also understand how to build cars there really get why you doing that and I love the state of California but they do not want me here now so they don't want me business they don't want anyone in California making anything except maybe solar assisted bicycles a did the business climate in the state of California and the associated HR cost and in insurance and workman's comp and liabilities like every couple weeks there's another absurd ruling that we get an update on that like wait what is like you mean to tell me if I catch a dude smoking crack while on the clock stealing my inventory I can't fire his ass on the spot what if you do you have to give him a pay at the time of letting him go and you can't make him sign anything that indemnifies nor protects you have to put them on probation and offer therapy and resources such as of safety of policy of company good like it has gotten so bad from the building inspector came by and he's like yeah you know those those Automotive lifts in your building and like yeah yeah I have 30 days to remove all those what thank you that was pretty much my response because yeah not my problem what about the last nine years of inspectors coming in all the time so you guys have the cleanest most professional aboveboard shop Kick-Ass well done thank you so much for making my life good because the other idiots on the new inspector so the new inspector says you're not licensed I'm not zoned appropriately to be in business where I'm at despite having permits and everything for did they change the zoning I don't know what the hell happened other than this new guy seems to be a prick and wanting to show his value what's his name actually don't remember but I literally at every turn it's killing me in like I'm a piece of s*** I think at this point to the amount of cost related per employee should be going to my employees not to insurance companies and all this b******* that gets tagged on top it's like for every dollar you pay someone now there's another $0.32 that should be going to them that's going to suck force you to work on these cars oh I can fight or you going to have to have someone I allowed to lawyer up and we're fighting it but I mean literally I honestly think they'd rather have a commercial weed facility in that building kicking out a hell of lot more tax revenue than us really you think that's what they're doing it to make it challenging for you to do business so that you quit yes and just about any small business owner I know in the state of California to challenges were facing or getting to the point of making us wonder about Iran intellect for staying in the state I don't know if you lose this you know if it gets the point that we we have to owe you mean this building situation ring phones and dig through my black book to find people with the clout to get the city to go see what's going on I think so and at first it seemed like you chilled out when we went above them and then everything was good and then a week later bubble back up again we got another notice so we're in the middle of it right now but you went above his head and you got to prove verbal crazy but look at the end of the day the reality is also I'm going against what trade schools are telling young kids that are going into the field what are they telling kids they're telling kids that here if you run the scan tool you'll be you'll make 150 Grand a year as a lead tech at a BMW dealership what they're not telling these kids while sucking other money out of them with crazy you know student loans and stuff is yeah that's like the kids in the street and Brazil all wanting to grow up to be Pele there's not that many Pele so there's plenty of dude that that dealership that are making minimum wage or thereabouts or dealing with the politics of flag hours or whatever but what would I'm having a hard time with his we charge $100 an hour for our labor I can't just keep charging more and more and more its level of what we do with projects that can run thousands of hours per job the math is it almost doesn't make sense like I honestly have guys that I think should be I should be 70 80 90 100 Grand a year to do what they do cuz they're artists and they deserve it the b******* of running a business in California all of the exponential cost there added on top theevandi incentivize overtime if I give a dude overtime it UPS his tax rate and they take even more out of the overtime will his whatever happened like GDP and employment and productivity and like keeping everything rolling their D incentivizing us even to offer our employ more money with more hours it's it's tragic and I have lost several guys now that have gone to do job that they hate but like Department of Water and Power I've lost several employees at DWP cuz though they get a pension that get killer Healthcare they get 90 grand a year to pick their nose and watch other people work sucks what is this is this a Democrat thing I think it might be the ringside of democratic because I am I think they'll do whatever they want to party systems is shitshow is it is anyway I don't think it's about which party so much as I think we've empowered attorneys to such an extent that it it says it's downright sinful because it's hindering industry it's hindering Innovation there's just so many constrictions cuz everyone has their hand out no one's no one's self accountable but everyone is liable I need a policy for that when we had a we had an employee wants to us he jumped in a dumpster to stomp on everything to compress it in the dumpster it started moving across the ramp parking lot and he jumped out of it clipped his leg on the way down and shattered his arm and forth but he sued me is like well it's not in your job description did someone tell you to jump in the dumpster and stomp on it military but it's my problem like what people whatever happened to like be proud of what you do be respected be well-paid everyone's contend everyone's like inspired him engaged and I just feel like more and more there's just so much noise and liars and policies all this crap plus eilers sublets and everything else but it's it's hard to retain people when when we we know we can't pay them what they're worth in this business environment I have a really hard time with the whole crack thing catching someone stealing smoking crack and you can't fire him that seems so strange have to give him a week's worth of money on the spot on the spot I need to be square by doing that but I generally like my back and my little leather studio and sell s*** on Instagram simplify life me and my wife and my dogs dealing with that'll shitshow you want to talk about something that puts everything in perspective you know we really made a stop and sit back and go okay that doesn't f****** matter like a lot of the b******* a lot of the noise in our modern world does not matter doesn't mean f****** thing so that kind of reinvigorated but also refresh my perspective to remind myself if someone's panties are in there not because their eyes been in storage for 6 months and then plug it into the tender in the battery is dead and they want to call and yell at me about it but I really like give me your bank info I'll send you your money back what is a lot of silly people out there for sure but it's just weird when they're empowered by the government when you don't have common-sense approach to Knuckleheads you know if you got a guy smoking crack and stealing things you're not supposed to reward that kind of behavior with a week's paycheck people there for sure but it's just weird when they are empowered by the government do you know when you don't have common-sense approach to Knuckleheads you know if you got a guy smoking crack and stealing things you're not supposed to reward that kind of behavior with a week's paycheck</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> derelict programme and I was like many things to my life started just from a stupid passionate idea like I did never never considered a business model of doing it it was just okay I've got two young kids I've got two Labs I like to do this I like to do that what do I want is my next car and let you know what I'm tired of over restoring s*** cuz that's like the pissing it whatever like I don't do that guy anymore so I think I like to find something that's already f***** up I'm just going to leave it looking all f***** up so I don't even I hate putting gas in it so with the derelicts all you do is clean the windows and vacuumed it a best party on then then I just put a massive gas tank so my old 52 DeSoto station wagon was the first derelict that I build a hundred percent myself nights and weekends just because I had this stupid idea and I wanted I realize it wasn't until it was done and it got back to cover a Hotrod and one of these awards that my dumbass went a different way of doing it pretty wild array of them and have a bunch of your first one was for you in the first place most people who you know high-dollar restoration you know are quote restomods or whatever you want to call them everyone wants them to be beautiful and pristine with you no handles that the disappear you know I mean that everybody wants to shave everything down and a lot of the original character of the design that they're supposed to be celebrating in the first place so that compounded by patina which tells a more personal story of like where's this car been how to get that Ding there's like romance and mystery all wrapped into one as far as the history behind all those finishes, how big is the gas tank on this thing miles to the gallon is a full emissions equipped modern SRT8 Hemi 6.1 and it'll get six builds that is the fastest and most fuel efficient of the Hemi build I've ever done I mean I think it's probably 15 first you were Mopar trannies which Phillip Builders avoid them they suck if you add even like 5 horsepower beyond the stock motor app they completely shut themselves so the third time I'm like that's it I'm done pulled a Band-Aid off throw that thing away and put a good old GM for early 5e in there so this thing has how many miles on it now fun fun ride but you know you going all the way back to the beginning of Icon even further back to the beginning of the first brand TLC they all started with personal cars like the icon idea was just another dumb idea that was rattling in my head was literally keeping me up at night and it got to the point that I need in this happens to me often like what you know what I did my watch and then all the different products that I've designed General start with something that gets to the point that I'll lose my remaining sanity if I don't actually create it inside the concept for Icon I could see it clearly in my head I had like a full-on 3D detailed model in my head and like my version of jumping over Sheeps at night in bed with like sitting there and zooming in on an element and changing that radius and scaling this trying that and it literally got the point YouTube because so many people on YouTube are interested and unique Builds an interesting companies are doing cool things like brev ology but your company particular it's so perfect because you do all those videos and you drive around the cars with this incredible detail and that's one of the first things you got me very attracted to your company was the fact like I go look at this m*********** he's so balls deep into this s*** so contagious though when someone's like really into something particular design and production and I totally agree and then like if you're not totally into it and you're not balls deep into it then pull out and zip up and go home shut up like to know that you do something else if you're not passionate about it you suck at it when someone's like really into something particular design and production and I totally agree and then like if you're not totally into it and you're not balls deep into it then pull out and zip up and go home shut up like to know that you do something else if you're not passionate about it you you suck at it</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> Just One More Story well-being but they're also speaks to like what the kind of stuff that you do I mean people like things that are crafted by artisans in I mean I love that major seeing that Revival right in the last years is just growing and growing and growing and slope with each other there's something about like when I drive your Bronco first of all I really like you cuz I love the fact that I'm driving Rock and then to I feel like it's a piece of art I feel like you know how I look at it highly functioning sculptures enter send the backseat the noise coming out of that third Point shoulder seat belt retractor is so unacceptable over modern car scanner is hitting your outboard ear and I'm like the whole witch baby at the retractors pulses next time you choose to drive you sit in the backseat let Mom and drive and report back years ago I developed the concept that I called the halios and if you ever saw that so I love like design challenges I like framing things right so I was like all right let's do a revisionist history approach to car design so what if electric cars had remained predominant in the late eighteen hundreds early 1910s what if we had taken inspiration from aircraft design a couple decades prior to when the industry actually did and then what if after he did the experimental plane the H2 I think it was what is Howard Hughes at settingdown and like he couldn't get that last Starlet to to go out with him right before he lost his mind completely what if he Buckminster Fuller and Gordon. Sat down and did a napkin sketch after too many martinis what would that car look like so that was my stupid Paula questions around which I framed my design designed it to work on the at the time and P85 platform and basically they received the copy of a letter that's titled like peanut butter and chocolate that was written by elon's core engineering team begging him to allow them to support me to do the built-in like since day one support we're because there's super shity about any repurpose turkey Shore Drive Teslas and Eli never address to visit major games think honestly I think dude it rich and due to the community that grows up around him that s*** been hacked now now people can open source hack the can data chain and people are repurposing Tesla component like I used Tesla batteries but I've been using their Motors are planetaries everything else cuz again what do I tell my client when the client needs an update or a part you go to the event but yeah like TV in fact has his new setup that they just started marketing where you literally take that IRS a part where the electric motors built-in there's little access to our you pull out a little circuit board you put in another one and voila is there an app that up like crate engines where you know or do you envision to set up where because you know you know that the new Hummers now going to be an electric vehicle which is really interesting and there's going to be a weather electric vehicles are coming out from Volkswagen that are really cheap and I'll buy a bunch of different companies are jumping in Univision there being some sort of a crate engine option for people that night so I do I do and I think there should be now proof in the pudding to this point is that everyone's focusing on the do-it-yourself Market therefore also on the cheapest possible equation which leaves a lot of in my opinion a lot of safety issues completely unaddressed and they can get down so the other issue is there all for ease of installation and conversion everyone's thinking about doing kits that literally re a spud plate in the short shaft to go where the engine used to be put an electric motor to a bellhousing adapter to the stock transmission which is stupid because electric cars going through manual transmissions there's a lot of Scavenging of energy it's bad enough to go through ring and pinion doing a right angle gear displacement of power efficiency and the best TVs in my opinion or transmission list or go through planetary said you know for gear reduction like that the Merc is the to my knowledge of the first for the retrofit TV that you know I'd being the goober that I am like I was like okay we've done a couple of you build but if we're going to keep doing them like and it exists how long do it take for a little bit over four years are infinitely better than had on I'm so proud of the valley retention in my vehicles and I'm proud of our foundation of taking something that in essence a lot of people would think is at the end of its already usable life cycle and upcycling it and breathing you like so it's good to go for decades again but now with Evie stuff is moving so quickly that am I like making iPhones all the sudden sore to years it's totally worthless right is the exponential growth and Improvement it just makes like no one wants an iPhone one so look at you no internal combustion engine development Cycles what I put in today is still relevant in a decade but with with electric it's a whole new space to consider management Electronics they just at PRI and it seemed made a fair bit annoyed about coming with a full array of EV retrofit conversion system so these seem to be the first ones entering the field that are going to offer a comprehensive Suite of products and solutions but then again being that it's part of this industry you know I go girl that dudes at their trade show booth and they're like well it's something we're working on it has all these press releases and all that the kennel. I think I might I trust it will come out but when you see Elon coming out with some like that new Roadster is going to have a 600-mile range that is when things get really interesting that you noted earlier that they were going to make the platform shareable and they're going to make it available to many different manufacturers large and small and I've heard stories like that over the years from you name it from Ferriday was claiming the same thing bulshit cuz now it's it's like I don't want to see vaporware but it's it's so much of that like VC money don't worry will be profitable one day and we're worth a billion multiple of nothing today so Buy in and then it's like so many of these EV startups and retrofit companies come to the scene looking for that elusive the FedEx Fleet contract that everyone thinks going to be easy to get and none of them get it and then they all go belly-up we're not only is the tech moving forward so quickly and not only that but the likes of brown and Lee only do two Tesla it's proven the viability in the market now there's purist and traditionalists and everyone's starting to poke at it and I see exponential more interest so I think you know for the next 5 years or so it's going to be a bit tumultuous but I definitely think it's the future of hot rodding II I imagine within 5 years I imagine half of my client Bilby electric wow that's a big that's a big statement have you seen there's a 68 Porsche 911 that has a Tesla engine in it very interesting when they do stuff like that the old cars but it is so many guys springing up out of the woodwork Nationwide to various levels of price expectation range expectation Etc but I think that's a really it's it's a lovely Community to I've noticed it's much more open than the conventional Automotive Community is about sharing information and suppliers and knowledge and helping one another and it's if there's a really nice camaraderie within that Community there's like movement Motors Austin's doing really nice retrofitz and Evie West has been around forever there really the Granddaddy's on the scene and early GTV Alfa they've done all sorts of different like pretty cool diverse range of platforms and then of course the electric down in Orange County that start out doing dogsnow the bugs in the buses and now 911 and it's like there's such a large and welcoming kind cool community of people in Dead Space easy you know you look for the Tesla superchargers are all over the place to press a button on your screen and it shows you where they are at all navigate you to them when you try to get one of those you can't charge a regular car to Tesla super station can you know and there's different so there's this standard I forget the anacreon week Rich the J blah blah blah connector but there's a standard Municipal connector in the news also the new fast-charge network but it depends on where you live but for example round here it's a joke so like I have a nap when I'm driving that 49 Merc and you know I was speaking at Barrett-Jackson and they're in town for a while I was visiting and then you networked apps and you find it but when we made that one supercharger compatible because the clients can install on in his house and the system otherwise public Tesla charger it has to do a handshake and it says no you may not charge here so you can have it supercharger compatible flick I have one of the wall back there so it would work yes that's my understanding but not a public installation those have to go through a whole handshake protocol getting plates like member in the Gadda on the play so that has the one interface connector and then the other one I machine this unnecessarily groovies for the gas cap under the original fuel door on the Merc and then that's for the other style charger so do you also you can charge it with different ones charger and then there's just two different pigtail adapters you can go either way with it do you anticipate up in the range on that thing do you think that someday you'll swap the battery is out indefinitely I think the reality is any EV project I build I have to not only do I anticipate but like I've lost many client because I'll be super blunt about making managing their expectations that look you're going to spend a lot of money to have the best of the state of the that is available to us but in a year that might all be garbage do you have to understand either you're cool with this moment in time and the range in the performance it is what it is or you're a techie like most guys that are engaging in that and you're going to be hemorrhaging money then coming back every couple years for us to upgrade and evolve as the Sciences of all the electrical Network 202 single-dose Tech 26 pin connectors Aerospace connectors so one day when that powertrain is no longer relevant but your truck still has good platform value unplugged that yank it out and put in the hydrogen or the micro capacitor or whatever the hell is working at the time</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you ever conceived a possibility of coming up with something that removes carbon from the atmosphere giant issue with us right right commissions so definitely I believe negative emissions has to kind of keep the warming in in in check it's a much more difficult problem. if you think of the ocean it's it's fitting that the two dimensional problem it's the plastic on the surface and fortunately it's not even the whole ocean it's kind of concentrating in these accumulation zone so the garbage patch that's twice the size of Texas it's still 1.6 million square kilometers while the ocean is 300% of the ocean atmosphere is three-dimensional so it's just as one-dimensional increases just think it needs to be like oh it's definitely exciting for him to think about I do think that's definitely that's not a good starter problem to to work on no one talked about where they had figured out a way to make these king size Century vacuum cleaners they were going to put in the center of certain cities I believe it was in Asia maybe perhaps China they come up with this and I don't know if they implemented yeah but the idea was to have these enormous things a place that look like a skyscraper and really it was just a huge vacuum cleaner for car but here is one good smart people are are working on that problem not sure where they are in terms of the economics and sit right here this one giant for are the same way of filters for water direct air capture technology carbon engineering 10 years in the making of can capture carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere on what that thing looks like it looks like giant f****** washing machines at right like it's washing the air wow structures and how many buildings are in there you know the people can make some pretty and Saints yet why could they make some giant insane vacuum cleaner for the air that's as big as a city block of course I love it comes down to economics or our system is not very good at evaluating things that are long-term directly benefit ourselves so so definitely people tax it will find a way to make it profitable just another one of what one would look like to capture billion tons of CO2 per year a of fans and then burn it that would be a great business model just be like a green diamond I had a diamond it's actually made and it's all pressured by solar power the solar power to f****** smash it there's many many forms in which carbon exists now so I know they are supposed they are doing that now they are making commercially made diamonds diamonds made of carbon so the form as carbon atoms under a high temperature and pressure they bond together to start growing crystals that's why I Diamond such a hard material because you have each carbon atom participating in four of these very strong covalent bonds that form between carbon atom read that word out loud Colville have you ever heard that word out loud that form between carbon atoms so they know they're doing they're making diamonds with certain machines high pressure if they did that would be hilarious that would be a good thing too because they would put a dent in the actual Diamond strange Market is diamonds aren't nearly as valuable as theirs Abita beers takes these diamonds and they stockpile I'm an alien release a certain amount of them they keep the price very high but Saul engineered the profit League diamonds used to be far more rare than they are now but with the innovation in mining technology and their ability to get to Diamonds they couldn't get to before they have a lot of times it's not as valuable as it appears when you go to buy one so we can make carbon against Alex Darin chainsaw Diamond imagine like if you like a really ecologically minded rapper you wear out all your ice could come from the ocean let everybody know from Trash to Treasure yes dude that the Bucking that's that the signature the company in quotes from Trash to Treasure these things dad bullion diamonds how about that death dude you can be the first guy to do this here we go plastic versus an ocean diamond is crushing the ocean into salty diamonds that's a dope looking Diamond two deposits in a high-pressure high-temperature experiment suggesting that many of Earth diamonds formed when the mantle crushes Ancient seabed Minerals Diamond deposits in a high-pressure high-temperature experiment suggesting that many of Earth diamonds formed when the mantle crushes Ancient seabed Minerals</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I mean if you do get to do this here's another problem okay here's it is a big one for the ocean we are depleting it up Seafood a flight from you know I had how do you say his name again so hilarious right Louis Savoy us who directed The Cove on Den we were talking about the deplenishing deplenishing on the wildlife in the in the ocean and when you start looking at it on a grand scale like how much fish they're pulling out of the ocean to 3 so bring you know maybe you can come up way to replenish fish in the ocean so we can continue eating sushi while you're so of course over the past 200 years Humanity has made tremendous progress since Agricultural Revolution 10,000 years ago UNC has been kind of stagnant no progress or just very very slow progress number of people life span it was all kind of flat nothing really happened and then since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution and when we learnt how to utilize science and knowledge Collective knowledge to to turn that into progress every possible metric for Humanity has improved tremendously in if you think of wealth Health violence education rights all these things that I know you that Steven Pinker on the is much more knowledgeable than I am truly at this point in time to be alive today but we have made tremendous progress by one hand measuring think the inventing Technologies and also Eventing institutions and on the other hand to collaborate effectively in large numbers which includes the corporation which is very effective way for people to work together now all that progress has always has also had negative side effects which must pronounce of course in the area of the environment where we put things into an environment that shouldn't be long there and we take too much out of its then nitrogen replenish which includes efficient on the other hand you have the plastic going into the environment Etc so how do we solve that and one hand is to say okay negative way to to phrase about the reactionary approach of saying okay we should consume less of corporations are bad Technologies bad we should all get rid of all those things and everything was great to live in harmony with nature so let's get rid of all this modernity and try and return to that pure original what I however belief that first of all let's I don't think it's a realistic thing people want to keep their iPhones and their cars and people want to move forward and at the same time I don't think it's pretty the most effective way to to solve these problems because it would be like fighting a leopard tank with the bow and arrow don't use that power to also try and solve these these these these problems as well so rather than trying to reject business rejecting on G I truly believe that we should embrace those those forces that make a human and has created this amazing Walt to also try and solve these these negative side effects as well and that's why I believe now the over cuz jumped over cuz I'm sheriff station not going to end by people all becoming vegan but rather through fake Meats I think that's the transport emissions are not going to be solved by people not flying anymore or not going anywhere anymore realistically people are going to fly more so you better event technologies that allow people to do that without harming the environment and the same thing I think it would be the Case 444 for plastic and Sandra Lee other energy uses as well. I think that's very wise way of looking at it and it's the hopeful way of looking at it it's funny that today kind of Haven it though you're you're you're dealing with the statistics and factual information like the fact that is a safer to live today there's less violent crime it's easier to get by this more technology more Innovation medical technology has improved dramatically all these things are true be still have to say it's not what we wanted to be there when I'm not saying the world even though you're don't worry about people barking at you so worried about pee with Bill terrible and parts of the world it's got terrible for the people of color it's still terrible but Transit still no one saying that there's not room for improvement but you have to say that like you even though you felt compelled you like it's still not perfect and I wonder why it's important to learn from the things that we do well and then I don't think it is. Controversial I think it's a trick that I think there's just a lot of people looking for every single opportunity to complain even if someone like you who writes an object Ali done nothing but good you say one thing like I mean Steven Pinker Took a ton of heat were saying that and even though he's talking about actual scientific statistics usual just not saying the world's perfect and everyone should shut up what he's saying is we should look at this you know from a bird's-eye view look down understand it at all though there's much work to be done wearing a great place in comparison to rest of human history and it's it's helpful to realize that progress is possible just that every there's something that's feels intuitively rights as if every step forwards would also have to equal a step backward elsewhere and I don't think that's the case there's plenty of things that you can invent that are not that cycling that we see it for something with with carbon right now that it's countries where Sweden GDP has grown a lot last 20 years carbon emissions has come down so they call that the decoupling and I think once we need the the main challenges in this century is to decouple human progress from from those negative side effects and I think the way to do that is not reactionary it's really again train Ovation and through to collaboration I agree with you and I think that a lot of times people just assume that this is the consequences of innovation if there's a pro and a con and everything because there has been so many things there have been so many things are inventions that were there are pro Anaconda but that doesn't necessarily mean it has to be that way if that would be the case all the technology and everything else you would be neutral and I wouldn't it wouldn't matter what your events but it would mean that an atomic bomb is morally as neutral as an ocean cleanup system which I just don't find possible so I don't believe that inventors entrepreneurs they put certain morality into their Creations into their technology there is there is a certain use that you prescribed with the revention when you don't use nuclear bombs to wash your car right away you use it not for benign uses unless maybe you want to terraform Mars switch some people propose to do with Tommy bumps I don't know what this is but cosequin consistently develop net positive Technologies eventually get better and better if say to 60% goods and maybe has 40% downside and okay but then we can invent a solution for that 40% and maybe that's again net positive and you can't get this this Cascade of improving more people thought the way you're thinking I think the world be a better place I like the the positivity I like the optimism and what you're thinking in terms of the particular in terms of what's what's possible with Innovation but I just don't think that being against something is very productive protesting against the things that I don't agree with there so many things I don't agree with but I don't think it's very helpful are then doing that are built towards the future that I do agree with you listen man I think what you're saying is very very logical I wish more people sound like you you're a great role model for a lot of kids to use your energy in a positive direction and if it can be done very very logical I wish more people sound like you you're a great role model for a lot of kids to use your energy in a positive direction and if it can be done</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> apartment the airport when I see like like a drug-sniffing working dog but it's like a yellow lab I'm like Norco yellow lab I don't I don't I don't want to ruin the dog in his chances at retirement you could ruin it cuz I'm like what are they looking for truth but you can only teach a dog to look for one thing you know you can't Trae the Truth the truth guns and Coke residue or like what do you smell like what are you what are you training you do not train the dog smell heroin and mushrooms bring them back right scription drugs like that's more like it ravages of community and I don't think I like airplanes I think like weight being pushed through from other country but I don't know I think it's all things meth is everything it's the really f*****-up part about it is it's almost like we were talking about football that football be safer if there was no helmets it doesn't make sense to be safer if they were friends state-issued if you apply for funding for support you're going to school like alone or the States paying free to go to school you go scholarship you cannot be able to apply for a state-issued prostitute if you are a little socially awkward maybe you haven't had sex because men get weird if they haven't been made privy to the way a woman is or they haven't had sex and going to college let's get you a prostitute let's get you having sex twice a week so you're not afraid of women let's get you a little less weird let's find a prostitute well thank you for didn't have the social stigma behind it there's a lot of people that would choose it over working at Wendy's lot of people to choose what we have an issue with my body that's what's upsetting but it's also if someone is doing that maybe maybe they are a sex slave like maybe there's someone who's I think that's what to do with the puritanical idea of things that they were accusing Robert Kraft of remember Robert Kraft guy who owns the crofter craps crap on the New England Patriots what was that it was that he was participating somehow and sex trafficking and so they were accusing him of that they were that was a big part of what the police were saying what turned out that none of the girls that work there were sex traffickers there just prostitutes and the woman that did it to him she was like 40 years there was a new store where they used a buzzword yes it's very specific in terms of like the difference in the consequences that you would want someone to face whether they just went there to get your dog or they participate in sex slave so that is part of the issue but I do know that if you take away the stigma and you can normalize things very quickly weed is a great example right you could do that and even we've done this with women and bodies in the way that we look at people who are overweight and we look at people with different things like we are getting to a place where it's less of a thing I think it was prostitution look at it as like this is her choice and if there if there wasn't an exception for it any other way except when money is involved that's where I have a problem with it but it's it's it's not even that it's it's a it's a societal position because they don't want their daughter or sister or mother to be a prostitute that's it that's all or them didn't want to be a prostitute that's why they would vote on it but this the only thing that's completely legal to do like not only that but it's what cells are it is f****** selling cologne he sounded I'm a hot man if you if you get my clothes you might get some p**** and looking right at that mouth as many people as she wants for free charges then also like what the fuc when it comes to the idea of a woman taking control of her own body no taxes being paid and the idea of someone being a w**** because of our puritanical roots in this country all those things combined make it a volatile topic but at the end of the day if she's going to make money that's going to go back into your Society that's going to be put to good use of going to be tax is going to be in your community what do you care what she's doing behind closed doors that is safe and it's regulated just like we'd all of a sudden their standards now it was a way to sanitize this I think so and they didn't Australia they didn't Nevada minutes full on there you could do whatever you want they have they have brothels but I think it's also one of the things that we're conditioned to have a perspective on it's similar to the drug issue like I don't want my friends or my daughters or my mother or anyone I know to be a prostitute so we have this like this position on it I also don't want them do Coke but I don't think Coke should be illegal I don't I don't think anybody should do a lock you in a cage cuz you want to get coked up imagine if it were legal how many less people would be dying just in a drug trade yes and how many more people would be aware of how much you can do because you'd get actual Coke what would they aren't companies right if you're going to buy something from the bisco camp bisco sound Coke real coke disco flavored cocaine in Europe the way that they are with alcohol like Italy for example alcoholic freak out when you are able to do something they got to do whatever they want they can watch TV they could drink and smoke pot and f*** and they go crazy for sure. Time and then at the end of that time they can either leave the church forever or come back and most of them come back right because it's all you know also you probably so hungover out play any sports play sports I just don't live across so I made up for an aggression so there's nothing worse than an athlete that's not good but they're very Crosslake hair all over the place and f****** this face one time so hard that I wasn't allowed to sit with my team like what's a shade Beyond a red card like a black Beating Heart would you do hit a girl with a stick with my car good for you and Pat you on the head good girl pretty good so I wasn't really a part of it out of paper cross and high school and I remember to use like tell me I was crazy to fight I don't like what's to stop someone from hitting you with those sticks and what you guys are running into each other man I don't kid yourself, you doing something violent you're just doing something weird pretend are supposed to hit in your passport but boys it's like football with sticks did you like just pick it up like a baseball bat and cracked his chicken head like how you do it over your head and come down that's not okay my nickname was women allowed to be aggressive it's a thing where it's like on sportsday like you know where start deal represent you got dude just running around ripping people's heads off raping Villages and one girl takes her shirt off at a World Cup game Megan Rapinoe doesn't mean it's like wolves scandalous and I just got back from the UFC broke the rules cuz everybody was just swinging at each other would be totally different sport not I was not great and I own that what did you do cuz you just went over your head I probably just came down years ago getting concussions from lacrosse who's like a lot of violence for it and it's not a professional sport because I think it would be an exciting professional rugby should be our football that's what I think I think would be better to the athletes less concussions they had less concussions back when they're playing those little leather helmets and knee pads cuz you just couldn't do what these guys are doing you're just smashing into Smash Head as a battering ram</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> do you ever feel that it's almost like you're absorbing too much because you are looking at all the problems of all the people and 7 + billion around the world and all these different horrific and justices I try to focus on what I can do and what I can do is is challenge my own government and as American citizen living in this Society I think that the US Empire and the Pentagon is the source of a lot of problems around the world I look at the world as complex I mean you have to understand the issues that are going on especially with foreign policy and terms of the colonized and colonizers the oppressed and oppressors and the u.s. is role as well as other previous Empires role in shaping the world as it is today and a lot of the problems that have Arisen are because directly US foreign policy whether it be the global war on terrorism Weatherby terrorism in general I mean that no drone strikes basically caused terrorism Weatherby the environmental crises the Pentagon is actually the largest polluter World more than 140 countries that essentially every country in the world almost a bigger polluter than the top four chemical companies combined so it all kind of stems back from this notion that you know the US has the world's largest Empire that ever existed and it needs to be stopped to save humanity and so as an American citizen I look at all the problems and I understand that there is like a very common route and I can do something about this, Andrew and if you're looking at domestic the lack of healthcare the lack of Education I mean Martin Luther King called it decades ago he says you know a nation that spends more and more on military spending is facing social death I probably butchered is quote but that's essentially the spiritual death I think is what he said but I mean if that's exactly what's happening is when we're squandering all of our money bolstering up this huge Global Empire we're not taking care of our people at home are brothers and sisters at home my empathy extends as an internationalist all around the world I know I feel for my brothers and sisters in Palestine Yemen everywhere but I can only do what I can do based on what my government is doing and you know it's doing a lot it's doing a lot of horrible things and it's time for us to really acknowledge what those horrible things are because we need to reinvigorate of an anti-war movement in this country and when you're saying that drone strikes create terrorism what you're really saying is it well with people if they do first and drone strikes primarily kill civilians and it's very strange sanitized way of handling an issue where if you had a person and you had some Rambo character you send them overseas you said hey I want you to go get this Isis terrorists and in the process kill everybody the f*** that you see every everybody that's in front of them that person be a war criminal you had a guy and he knew that some Isis guy was in an apartment building so he just started going down men women and children in that apartment building until he got to the terrorist that guy would go to jail but if you do it with a remote control and you launch Hellfire missiles out of a drone and it blows up the apartment building and kills all these innocent people but also gets a terrorist its mission accomplished and it's crazy it's crazy that we're signing off on that it's it's a thing because we're not there where this is weird sort of a adjust a there's a bridge that we're allowed to cross into this really sickening act it's a very stiff when you have anything that's ineffective to the point where most of the people it kills are good people or at least our innocent people should say that's crazy I mean this is not saying that is not terrorism is not a horrible people in Iceland you look I'm a pro military person I think we need military and I think it's just like the same I need we need cops but to deny the cops sometimes are bad is f****** crazy to not deny that sometimes when you allow the military-industrial complex to do things like have drones that launched missiles into wedding parties because you think one of the people might be a terrorist and are often incorrect often to the tune of 90 + percent look at you knows the last 10 years you look at some of these terrorists to have conducted terrorist attacks you look at actually what their intention was in a lot of them the vast majority of literally sight US foreign policy revenge mean every time you kill 98% innocent people whoever survives if you lost your whole family that you have an incredible amount of motivation to get back at whoever did it right and that whoever did it is the United States stop normalizing this and you know militarily speaking Trump actually you know it's not his truck I mean this is a bipartisan effort throughout the entire Congress if there's one thing Congress can agree upon its to make nonviolent DDS efforts against Israel legal and also to just keep ramping up the military and egging on whoever's sitting in the Oval Office to be more militaristic and that's exactly what's happened with Trump in a bizarre way I mean Congress approved to like a 7 on your trillion defense budget and the increase alone in the last year was basically Russia's entire military budget more than Russia's entire military budget that's how much the s**** ramping up and then you have the space force I mean it's just like how far is this going to go to society is collapsing if you looked at the argument against this you would say we need this in order to keep people safe here they'll be the argument against it question would be what are we what threat is there Isis when has Isis ever done anything here other than I mean there was like a truck I mean come on we already know the statistics on terrorism in this country and they're very low right I mean you're if you're basically more likely to die from Mike Furniture falling on you or your apartment yeah yeah and the whole Isis thing I mean set still criminally ongoing I mean Trump announces indefinite extension of the criminal occupation of a rock it's just crazy how normalize this as you know far longer than Vietnam war in Afghanistan fatalities at an all-time high all of these things are a direct result of US foreign policy and look at the refugee crisis look at immigration the Honduras coup all the ships connected and that's what we need to start like expanding our Consciousness and our empathy worldwide to understand all of these things are linked in the struggle is all linked and our world is shrinking really rapidly what candidate speaks in this way like what candidate do you think understands and recognizes all these things that you're talking about I mean Mike gravelle hit the only one who's like we need to end the US Empire Bernie and you'll see my crevalle was he was the guy who the Pentagon papers into record he is a good guy really awesome but I need toll cease speaking a lot about regime change Wars which is extremely important but she still believes in front strike she basically has a little bit of Obama's foreign policy that I don't agree with that fundamental understanding I can't believe that she believes in some sort of just broad-brush use of it I haven't looked into that the nuances of that but I do think that no one is saying I want them to about us Empire about you no scaling back the US Empire and and stopping all of the Civil Society movement because it's not just about invasions anymore it's about you know usurping the Democratic processes of all of these countries like what we've done in Venezuela what we're doing all around the world to try to foment unrest all of this needs to be stopped for sea of time where our dependence on foreign oil is radically reduced to the point where it doesn't judge by these regime-change wars in our dependence on these resources that these people have I mean this is almost every conflict in the world you can boil down to the acquisition of resource protection of capital and that's like what a lot is what a lot of it is now is actually just Capital interest needing to expand and grow and continuing to up and increase the profit structure of these corporations and that's exactly why we've seen Imperials you know kind of go out of control in the way that it has I don't know I mean I thought that we were more independent oil wise I don't think it's good I think that climate change yeah I think that's it hasn't stopped you know it hasn't stopped the imperialist Misadventures of the US government so I think I just need to be a really big shift in Consciousness and then people to stop thinking that it's our right and that we have to know the right and the duty to do this around the world it doesn't the right we don't have it it's not right then it's really not and we need to really reinvigorate the masses here because again Society is collapsing that's pretty f****** obvious bro even if it's not obvious what is obvious is that we're not evolving right in terms of if we're still involved in drone strikes that kill 90% of people if we're still involved regime-change wars were still involved unnecessary military actions against Iran it's these things are people freaking out about this is all the same kind of s*** that people have been fighting against forever that we don't want our brothers and sisters and husbands and wives to die for nonsense we don't want them to die for some people that live in his air-conditioned rooms that are making billions of dollars that are profiting off of the actions of these these people who think that they're doing it to protect America I mean this is the narrative that they're being served this is what they're being told and when they're going to these places they're not going to those places to act as evil as as to as the the boots of some Empire they're going over there because they think they're protecting Freedom they think they're protecting their famine their loved ones back home that's why they're doing it and we're still doing that we're not evolving wanted to go out there they're the ones who are going to the sacrificial Lambs for these defense contractors and that you can argue anymore that this is for freedom I mean how can you what threat does Iran pose we had so it's so tough so I don't I don't know what what benefit would it be for them to start some s*** with us and that is the craziest idea ever. That's like my you know a nine-year-old kid trying to pick a fight with Mike Tyson's f****** doesn't make any sense like what are you trying to do trying to get killed I mean inevitably we're trying to get to the global confrontation with China and Russia I guess I mean that's it's scary to think that we only have a couple independent states left to knock down to be under complete subjugation from the US Military and global capitalism it's pretty nuts won't even if we do move into some sort of some sort of a situation we're in control then we're bigger Target and with the amount of nuclear weapons that are possessed by these countries that were I mean just what North Korea has just this one small f*****-up country could ruin life on Earth just this one country and forget about Russia we could literally annihilate each other right that's a possibility chose to launch an attack if they decided they have a justification to launch an attack then all sudden we're in a real war like a f****** war war people are invading us it's getting knocked down buildings and bombs blow up I mean or devolving capacity to cooperate to innovate and we're stuck we're stuck dehumanizing the other we're stuck with this Mass conditioning to basically perpetuate these these in justices and it's really a shame I mean we have all the information at our fingertips but we still keep reverting back to what's the myths the myths that underpin our society is conversations and what can we do what where does it end where does it go now these are the big questions and then also did what we discussed before it's impossible for anyone to really have a deep nuanced understanding of all these different issues right what we can do wheat you know the heaviness of it all you just have to do what you can do you're doing what you can do you have me on to to help spread awareness about these issues and that will freak out and also just understand your place you known and just extend that you can and just yeah I mean it's it's hard because I don't have the answer all I know is what's needed and what's needed as we need a movement of the masses if not going to come from the top down it's going to come from a Grassroots mobilized effort to try to change these policies that's the only way things have ever changed in the past and I absolutely have hope and optimism that we're going to change things and that we're going to correct this horrible path that were on do you think that the 2020 election can have a real significant impact of any of this and you think that whoever gets into office can really have an effect on the kind of policies that were talking about with the kind of influence of the military-industrial complex of all these lobbyists of Wall Street all about all these like Monsters machines that just pure good old-fashioned democracy can actually step in and and turn the ship away from the Rocks Bernie I really do think that he's won last chances not because I think that he's going to completely do some revolutionary upheaval from the top down as we know Congress is stocked with a lot of terrible people who will block a lot of these efforts but I think that he's going to mobilize the masses and reinvigorate the labor movement and reinvigorate unions and help workers understand that they need to fight for these rights that have been eviscerated you know over the last hundred years one thing that does inspire me as well as seeing people like Elon Omar is incredible she's a Somali Refugee she Advocates BDS against Israel and she does not f****** back down I love that woman what an incredible woman she got this viciously attacked for retweeting one of my episodes from Empire files and I think it just shows how scared people are of of her and her ideas and you saw how hard everyone came down on her for just saying that is real has an influential Lobby and DC she's also wearing religious scarves right right away is the job and then there's something somebody hit piece on her yesterday to see anything she married a brother that's ridiculous country that's a religious marriage but then she had another I don't know what's the only one in Congress other than a band of course AOC and you know some other very few people but she's out there everyday speaking against the military industrial complex being against the wars I think as a refugee she under and the effects of US policy and I'm really excited that she has a voice in there but again I don't think that the hope is going to come from within Congress and the system is way too far gone with the Electoral College and the gerrymandering and the voter rights you know that I've been rescinded its it's a lot and it's an uphill battle but that's why someone like Bernie I think we'll turn to the people and say I can't do this alone you have to come out and get my back and we have to have millions of people in then rescinded its it's a lot and it's an uphill battle but that's why someone like Bernie I think we'll turn to the people and say I can't do this alone you have to come out and get my back and we have to have millions of people in the streets demanding these things that's the only way it can work</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Bloom boxes know really what is it thinking about them lately I remember seeing him on 60 Minutes years ago and I think Google headquarters was powered by one what does are these funky little black boxes that had some chemical process of creating energy and they were like early on massive news promising Tech in their super groovy little simple boxes and they originally did it for like campuses military like large large installations for you multiple complexes and stuff and they were also making them for automotive and they had a prototype I was so excited I think it was elements within the shielded box to create the energy but they were like self-sustaining and super groovy boombox literally is just a big black box doesn't what's in there it's just one of those things that seemed so promising that then went bye-bye seemed like to Royal engines there was a great engineer at the Lodi that was real getting to radials and get a Ford Focus that would do is like his daughter's old car with a blown up motor he had his own to Royal Motor that he had developed that could run from the energy in the charged particles in the air what thing did like 15 miles an hour on a flat Test Track Running on are charged particles in the air is charged particles as they are could be a real speed wow I saw him once at a trade show and I was exhibiting at the show as well since they're on setup there's bored out of my gourd we were done by was already set up in the fort boots that is walking around for the sniffing around and see this trippy scientist guy in his lab coat in this s***** little booth was like a note 6 by 10 foot booth and radial thing and then a bigger toroidal thing and literally like a chalkboard slime tube what's going on so start talking about it starts explaining the technology and what he was doing and like the smaller one at 300 foot pounds of torque the larger one had two thousand and he was looking to develop it for rail cars for semis for cars like an on and on and on as I get the biggest problem is stopping you from 12 to 2 of that first cylinder was such that when the combustion occurred and it propelled the next piston into the next combustion cycle and kept going so getting that power out of the simple crank was a challenge and then how to stop the damn thing was like the bigger challenge but they'd run on like horse piss ionic charge particles diesel gas boot gun empty done and I have the guys info and try to reach out to him website go on the website I looked at the Night Before Dawn that gobbled up five years later I see him again in another trade show with another kickass design and man was he a bitter man so I can never again cuz they bought it and they shelled it I'm never selling anything again f*** them I'm licensing to specific channels of applications and that's it his new product so what do you think happened if your conspiracy theorist do you think someone bought him out and just bought a small independent business owner real realest in that hell yes someone didn't like that and they shelved that s*** so they bought it and so is next product generator and you had a small battery in the vehicle right so this is a retrofit system the retail model was brilliant because you have like a pretty cheesy inexpensive 3 axis Mill a s*** ton of CAD files and one product on the Shelf so in a lightweight car it was like an electric supercharger to replace your alternator and had a tooth Cog and for the pulley and then your crank pulley wood added to the card to it and then to the Bell so the idea was it would assist the internal combustion through its compression cycle it would negate the parasitic load of all the Fiat all the front engine accessory Drive mounted things you know your alternator is smog pump or whatever like pushing engine through the cycle with the captured electrical energy from the deceleration use it and then the guy disappeared off the face planet again series Crisis guy should happens if you remember there was a video that was circulating many years ago about a guy who created a car to run on air no excuse me water get created a car that runs on water and then this car that ran on water make you apparently had a viable engine and it was really working and then he he he had a heart attack and as he was dying you saying they killed me they killed me and then he died but we can put them in a little box and called a conspiracy theory or whatever and he has therefore it never happened doesn't believe in conspiracy theories I say look at Jeffrey Epstein could do what physicists say is impossible turn water and hydrogen fuel efficiently enough to drive is dune buggy cross country on 20 gallons straight from the tap that's f***** up that's f***** up I don't know if it's true history of mankind have been a little off The Rocker sexual desires and love affair that we had and the distraction and presented that he in quotes destroyed his sexuality I do not know what that means I don't want to be walking around like a mini have a hip switch sort of swept aside that you wonder like there's a documentary who killed the electric car I don't know who he is but that is another example of the you know that was an innovation that was a little bit ahead of its time and the powers-that-be were like f*** you early patent troll horse carriages and we got these new motor things and you know what something to could be a Horseless Carriage so we like literally did like a chicken scratch b******* drawing and filed it and got awarded the patent so Henry Ford in his first two companies as well as the Dodge Brothers all the early Pioneers in the transportation sector in the US had to pay this break a massive royalty to even produce the vehicle and it was Henry when he read when he after he went down and under knee has reborn and came back out with Ford Motor Company the second time that I'm not paying this s*** and it was like eight years of Court battles to overrule it in the National Automotive Dealers Association originally didn't want any trouble and everyone was pan and Henry was the one who had the gall in the balls if they know where you're not pay this brick and they finally got a kicked out but they say that the injured innovation in transportation for a good decade only the electric starter the magnetic starter that Henry Ford integrated into his cars that really made the massive shift away from predominance of electric cars to internal combustion so when you flash forward in your look at mr. pains filmed who killed the electric car and you look at Firestone and dad who was it Pacific oil oil company Tire company and they created that bus company and then they did all the law privatized Municipal transport so that then they could slowly by them all up and you know California had an incredibly successful electric Trolley system through the Westside it was brilliant his pioneering was at everyone they're the ones that ended up stacked in the desert near this some of that footage in the film that everyone they're the ones that ended up stacked in the desert in this some of that footage in the film company that's doing amazing everyday put it on the Shelf</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you know there were. Periods of time and in our history where people would steal our religious objects and our sacred items they still do and ludar Graves law called the Native American Graves protection and repatriation act that was meant to repatriate those stolen items in those stolen ancestors back to tribe so that we could help with our cultural revitalization as well as put our ancestors back to rest there are still at least 200,000 ancestors in boxes in museums that's just in the US in the US just in the US around the world French people in boxes in museums in the US are recently in our sacred objects for some reason there was a sacred Shield of the Pueblo of Acoma in about 2016 that was being sold at auction in in France the the tribe the Pueblos fought and even went to court in France to try to stop at auction and get that item back because there was evidence that it had been stolen in contemporary times and France said you don't have standing in our courts so even though they're considered Sovereign Nation here in the United States we didn't have sing in in the French court and couldn't protect that item this way so we had to use other means of negotiation and arm-twisting that item is finally been repatriated but it took it took about four years to for that to happen no this is a sacred object right these are items that are used for religious purposes or after their protected sacred items and the association we were fighting with the Metropolitan Museum of Art last year and the year before because they were displaying items from a private collection that were sacred one item was even a funerary objects with an item that is never supposed to be seen because it's buried with the ancestor and it was on display and without any kind of consultation with the tribes affected it's horrendous the way we still look at Indian people and and our cultures and our practices today I were still being called heathens everything article I think just last week there was a a religious man saying that we're heathens because the stage that I gave you because we burn stage as one of our medicinal and in spiritual practices the reason why a Christian group an Ohio where indigenous peoples have just been removed wholeheartedly is that tons of archaeologists and other people that like to loot they have taken so many things out of the ground there was a case that the FBI actually got ahold of in Indiana gentleman by the name of Don Miller who had huge Ranch House in farm and it was just full of Native American artifacts including human remains and there were even items from other countries that he had had looted and taken and the FBI actually investigated that Anne and because the man was like 90 years old they didn't prosecute him but they were able to take back those true that Native American Graves protection and repatriation act I've been Consulting with tribes to repatriate those items back but that looting and collecting and in areas like Indiana and Ohio and if so where this gentleman's get all this stuff including the FBI told media Outlets report Mueller report admitted he conducted illegal digging Expeditions we never face criminal charges before his death in 2015 so this guy was just digging stuff up and just showing around his house and then there were rules against this oh absolutely absolutely keep any records of where he got a lot of the items so our laws are really screwy with this to so Federal and tribal lands are protected so public lands parks and tribal lands are protected lands you can't go and Dig Inn in federal or tribal lands without a permit among other things but just in state private private lands it's really dependent on state laws are in and it's it's really inconsistent whether those weather looting is protected or not so that's where it's interesting because there's a lot of gigantic ranches in Texas that are privately owned that were originally Native American hunting grounds they they're the ones that a friend of mine is hunted on that they have these pictographs you go inside these caves and it says on private land someone owns this can artwork all over the walls of the cave and signs of fire like they'll sit on the ceiling of the cave where the lit campfires like this should probably be some sort of a historical site bright and it's it's usually not protected and and dumb people get real angry when Indians try to get involved in and we're there maybe development that hat will have an effect on Berry side of sacred site other other type of site people really get angry and it it's so it's really hard for tribes to work to protect these areas work to learn about what the areas are even about there's been so much amateur archaeology in this whole country was founded on amateur archaeology let's for for gold and other special things and oftentimes they just took whatever was in the grave and and and created all over the world today so the association is constantly looking at auctions and trying to return items it that private collectors have been improperly we just got a human vertebra removed from u.s. auction just a couple of weeks ago they were selling it because they said it had an arrow point still in you know so that that has value in in in some markets how do they prove that it wasn't just satellite that was killed by an arrow right I don't know and that's the thing about that's the thing about I'm trying to work with auctions and private collectors as they often don't want to work with us because they're trying to make money so often times items whether their religious objects or human remains they have a story or with call the provenance associated with them that is often made up to dry the price of the item so whether that was illegitimate a vertebra van Native American we don't talk to them how would they determine who the person was isn't necessarily going to tell you where it came from it could tell you that it was Native Americans in the state of Washington he was old old old old and the universities involved in the Army Corps who had possession of it we're going to repatriate it to appropriate tribes and what ended up happening is is that you know Academia stepped up and said I wait this isn't Native American we think he's something else and four years back and after a court case that the item wasn't that the ancestor wasn't Native American DNA test was done and it was indeed Native American and and the ancestor was finally so I say if you want and it's brought back and given to Native Americans to who until we're right so so so let's look at the best case scenario and in a lot of museums have maintained records that may have human remains and Associated funerary objects and have enough information to know where that came from Woodside was located at what county what state and we know from tribal histories as well as as Federal us documentation that that that area was likely affiliated with with you know this tribe or that tribe or maybe several tribes and so consultation occurs under that law about those ancestral remains in funerary objects and it's determined where those items should go back in the case scenario where there's not any information often times evidence of a will who were the collectors that were giving to that institution what has been the history of the institution and where has it obtained different Collections and through that you know it's deduced who may be affiliated with with those those items are the the ancestors so it can be a pretty long. process but what's interesting about it is is is museums and other institutions fought this law for a long time and they said well you know all of our collections will you know we won't be able to fulfill our purposes at a museum or an academic institution to study these things work to consult with museums most of these items are in boxes and often poorly managed and maintained so they're just sitting somewhere in storage right Americans do you agree with the idea I'll get want to hear Kennewick man finally it's free-to-play never found in North America what does it give us a date on his what they have car go to that picture that he's again that's crazy so so just let me tell you that looking at human remains for many tribal peoples is is difficult it's like looking at him a naked body I mean it's it's the essence of someone that you know we shouldn't be saying that that should have been in the ground that should have gone and disappeared it had a journey at got interrupted and and you know it some tribes and cultures believe that that's harmful to interact or look at or just it a little bit humiliating it's exposed an In-N-Out and at least in the United States you won't find that in any kind of Public Museum now you might in some kind of private institution or private collection other cultures that they're trying to get those back to some sort of a that be cool if that was Ronald Reagan you know what that be cool if that was someone from our you know our lifetime that died with had Janis Joplin's head you know in a box somewhere and then go stare at it when that weird you out or how about Amy Winehouse how about someone that died yeah she was saying yeah that way we don't seem to to to go oh that's not okay so it's no Outlaw their religion how would I feel if someone did that to me right</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> one of the things they talked about in Black Elk was the practice of the Ghost Dance to this idea that they were going to somehow or another bring back the old ways and it's a sad sad story when you hear them talk about especially because it's coming from the words of black alcohol with a guy that was there with the Battle of Little Bighorn and then from then now is an older man talking about what would his experiences have been haven't had seen as people moved to reservation I seen it basically every single treaty broken I mean was there a single treaty that United States had with the Indians and it didn't break that what that's insane mean every single one and most treaties had some similar language a lot of them talked about they had bad man Provisions so bad man Provisions were basically if our men the us if our men come in and to your jurisdiction and do something bad will take care of it for you you know just some simple Provisions like that but never was enforced the US let let their people come in and take over what we're supposed to be protective areas of land and that was just constant that happened that happened everywhere so there were bad Provisions through a lot of Provisions lot of beautiful Provisions that that the tribes still talk about today as long as the Grass Grows and we'll have our lands and in none of these Provisions wherever upheld and a lot of the East Coast tribes there their boundaries were changed a new treaties were made and accepted and Andrew removal happened and there were new treaties and nothing was ever maintained and the other tribes that were removed to Oklahoma and by the way because of that removal their tribes that were already there were removed so they're already tribes there the Caddo and Comanche another other tribes that this was our he their land so new tribes moved in and land dreaming I'm forgetting my dates now but there was a Dawes commission around 1906 or so there was a census and individual Indians were allotted about a hundred sixty Acres apiece and this was an effort to decrease the amount of land base that tribes held in common right and this happened all across the country not just in Oklahoma where there were allotment policies and I believe there were there were about heck I'm not good with numbers I think they were like 19 million Acres that that were removed this way of of land but what happened today there is a criminal case before The Supreme Court that is actually addressing these issues because even though our lands were allotted the exterior boundaries of our reservations the area that we had agreed to live in they've never been extinguished never been diminished and so the Supreme Court's is activist Supreme Court has actually looking at this issue now is to whether we still have jurisdiction within the exterior boundaries of our reservations in Oklahoma well so so not necessarily so so it's raised a lot of fear with with non-indians about taking back the Land O my God but what would actually happen there's a lot of places in Indian country where there's a lot meant and there's there's a non-indian individuals who have feel and within the exterior boundaries are reservations and then individual Indians only feel and within the exterior boundary reservation land how you would how you own land it's called it's not restricted it's it's it's in you own the title to that land right a lot of land held by tribes in trust during restricted fee so common Ariel and likes like let's look at them the Onondaga nation in New York state they have the exterior boundaries of the reservation they own a restricted file and so they own it but they can't sell it without us permission trust land is similar and it's treated the same as restricted fee but it's held in trust so the US has more control of of of what happens on that land or has been seen to have a little more control than it wouldn't in just restricted fee but with a boundaries of the reservation you can have this checkerboard ownership of land of non-indians and Indians and and but that doesn't necessarily mean that the tribe has jurisdiction over the non-indian feel and and the the civil and criminal jurisdiction issues on an area of land like that is extremely complex and continues to be argued in the courts and it most of the time our jurisdiction most of the time since the 80s and 90s and up until today we there was really a change in kind of how the Supreme Court decided Indian law cases so if we back into the history of Federal Indian policy you see this kind of weird schizophrenic you know those those those Marshall cases that I talked about they really stepped forward kind of schizophrenic principles that unions are sovereign but the Civilized so we have to take care of them and so you have a different eras of time policymakers who support tribal sovereignty cases to help support that sovereignty and then there are other administrations that come around not talking about current Administration but that that use those cases against us an integrated policy and degrade any kind of rights that we may have gained in in other eras so it's it's really been you know Indians today live in this live in such an insecure world you know our statistics are horrible the suicide rate for youth high school graduates everything that you could possibly think of there's a statistic on were usually the lowest were the worst and it's because we live in a society that is constantly changing we can never depend on whether or not our rights are secured whether or not we're going to have the lowest are the worst and it's because we live in a society that is constantly changing we can never depend on whether or not our rights are secured whether or not we're going to have land jobs being able to practice our culture</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> the things that I got out of this recent obsession with American Indian culture and the stories was realizing how little I knew about the history of this country you know you you might know you might have a basic understanding of what happened that you learned in school it's real peripheral and it's very surface and then upon reading these books and maybe realize like what happened here this is what happened here over the course of a couple hundred years is almost unprecedented in in history like that this nation was conquered by all these Invaders that just kept coming in kept changing the rules kept breaking trees making trees breaking treaties wiping people out calling things battles when they were really just massacres of women and children Municipal horrendous horrendous stories of justification of these massacres that were no no different than any other horrific Barbarian Slaughter that you might have heard about in history that's looked down upon but four years in this country they were taught as if they were actual battles in that did the history of this country with in regards to the tribes and the American settlers and the soldiers is terrifying it's terrifying it is just happened a couple of hundred years ago and that people are capable of these things and the ancestors of these people I just roaming around today and that's what this country was founded on this country was founded on the massacre site and and and that policy has been steady by folks like Adolf Hitler and in his book Mein Kampf but it wasn't just the battles there have been many different types of battles that we consider Warfare though it hasn't been done with you no guns and legal right legal battles exactly I mean since the 60s Europeans have been trying to educate us and assimilate us and in civilize us and have passed laws once the States became a nun new country and 1800 pass laws to take our children and move them far away and and punish them if they spoke their language cut their hair put them in the schools that were military based and they studied academics in the morning and then they did trade in the afternoon and in those trades were to help pay for cool so they were basically indentured servant slave labor making sure that the school could have enough funds to pay for their own education and the boarding school history in the United States and Canada has horrendous Renda stories and the schools were funded by the US federal government and dissociation and other groups are trying to get the United States to release records of of who were the children in the schools we think there's a there were about 500 boarding schools across the United States and about at least 20,000 children that we can figure out where were killed were duck died in the schools some of this work has been done at the Carlisle Indian School and in Pennsylvania which is now owned by the Army Corps Army Corps of Engineers and there are some tribes that are trying to repatriate their children that are engraved Aaron and bring them back home so this is been a process all over the country trying to figure out you know who these children were where they belong and in to bring them home it's been a really difficult process for the organization any of them cuz he's not being fed working too much all those things that could kill a child at all these think those records of all these different children probably doesn't have the records probably has mismanaged a lot of the records regarding these boarding schools in and there were different times have been different eras of Indian policy where the federal government was like oh wait this isn't working let's let's get out of this business of teaching Indians let's give it to the church has let them do it for awhile and then it would come back into the federal government and but the churches would have it at course we've heard all of the horrible things that different churches have done to children and there are still many boarding school survivors today that can tell those stories of abuse sexual and physical and who still live with that today there is a organization called the Native American boarding school healing Coalition that is really working on these kind of issues and have are pulling together the stories and are also working with survivors I to try to heal from that that trauma that's not just theirs but it's it's this insured intergenerational historic drama that has been with our communities for a couple hundred years now so they're there are a lot of stories like that in the end this again mrs. US federal policy while they were while the US was building the reservation system and and and putting tribes kind of in these Blockheads if you did not send your child to school you weren't given rations you weren't given your food if you practiced your culture you could be killed for practicing your culture using your language because and because this was the assimilation policy of the day and this happened I would say 18:15 70s through the 1920s there was this horrific. Of federal Indian policy of of doing trying to do away with language communal type living cultural practices in religion so this isn't just you know gun warfare this is been continuing policy that affects us today policies it even affects us today on warfare until they got the Indians to move into the reservation and then it was basically an annihilation of the culture international law</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> let's go to that then this is the United States has a very strange situation with Native Americans were Native Americans have reservations and on those reservations they have sovereignty they can have different rules they can do what they want to exchange is like those Nations inside of our nation how do you feel about that start with the beginning like how did how did how did we get to where we are today there and there's a lot of information and so you got to stop me if I start getting too carried away all right so there are Supreme Court cases and there was his name John Marshall who is actually buying Indian land from from us the US Country u.s. Grants and so he was interested he was an interested party but he was making decisions that that set forward the kind of watershed principles that continue to affect who Native Americans and Indian Nation governments are today and so those three cases coming to court to try to determine who owned a piece of land in Indiana and there was one guy Johnson who is plaintiff who would purchase the land directly from the pinkish all Indians were related to the Miami Tribe today and then the defendant was MacIntosh and he purchased Land from the US government and so the case of course was who had the proper rights and through that case The Narrative that Justice Marshall created brought forward a piece of Discovery have you ever heard of the doctor to conquer Dennis Heathen people's so this was the principle that this case was based on and it set forward this weird relationship the tribes in the US government have today so if the us if the Christian European peoples had the rights to take land away from tribes because they were an inferior race which is this this is language from Meister inferior race they're Savages they're unable to govern themselves and they only have a right of occupancy so that was the first of three cases that Justice Marshall decided and of course he was an interested party in the whole thing because he had purchase land from the United States and he wanted to make sure his land was Secure the second case was Cherokee Nation V Georgia they gotten through Congress to remove the Eastern Indians west of the Mississippi River and Indian Territory which is of course now Oklahoma Kansas Texas area and and again this was the case that actually of the Cherokee Nation tried to bring before The Supreme Court and before The Supreme Court could even make a decision on the and I just realized I didn't even tell you the facts of the case I'm getting ahead of myself I apologize this is this is incredible experience to be here so I'm a little bit nervous so in Cherokee Nation vs Georgia Georgia was trying to assert its laws over the Cherokee Nation and so the Cherokee Nation brought this case before The Supreme Court to say that the state does not have any right to assert any of its laws against us and what Justice Marshall did is sit is said well you're not a foreign Nation so you can't bring a case before The Supreme Court and determine the tribes were pseudo Sovereign Nation that they were still under the tutelage they needed to be civilized again the same kind of Savage language in this case and held that the federal government had plenary power over tribal Affairs and that the Cherokee Nation couldn't bring this case to court so what ended up happening is some missionaries who were serving the Cherokee Nation actually developed the case and violated Georgia so they could bring a case before The Supreme Court in that case was called Worcester V Georgia and I think that was about 1830 to 1831 and in that case it was ruled that the United States had a guardian and Ward type relationship with tribes and so we were the wards they were our guardian and that set up this weird dynamic that still exist today the Supreme Courts and other case other courts site in decisions today to basically take away more and more rights so so that was that's the Watershed basis for this weird relationship that we have and it's based on racism it's based on tribes being an inferior peoples they not be civilized and and so here we are so help help directly into another question here so fascinating thing the idea that the United States government is that they're like the big daddy over the tribes and the only way the tribes can exist as if they exist the European way right the great white father and so all this was happening while they were trying to conquer the West so all this was happening around the gold rush time before then so this was happening in the 1830s was 1850s absolutely Civilized Tribes were in the Southeast at that time and that's what's so interesting is because you see through this is a this is a little bit why have a problem with some of the books that you've read is because they've taken small pictures of what was going on and kind of removed the context of what was really happening there so many tribes across the United States that tried everything to resist or comply or stimulate so that they can maintain their weight I've maintained their lands and continue to prosper as they had been but the United States was obviously for a formidable opponent and regardless of of of for example of Five Civilized Tribes and their their their tactic was to assimilate was to go to school and educate themselves and learn English and even though they did that and they did everything that the United I wanted them to do they were forced off their land to the West into Indian Territory the Comanche learned about through the book they that those events happened during a point of time and that was their effort and resistance they saw how disease wiped out their brother and from other nations than that folks were coming to get them and so that was their way of resist being simulated and having everything taken away from them in the defense of the authors of those books they did Cover a lot of that they did these books are in no way taking the side of the United States government you know most of them the most amazing thing about Empire of the summer moon was just how special the relationship that the Comanches had to the land in about how when did Jessica and Parker's at with no Cynthia Cynthia Ann Parker who is she's the photo out there the woman that's breastfeeding your child she was kidnapped when she was nine and assimilated with the Comanches and then was re kidnapped by the United States government when she was in her thirties and didn't want to go back she missed the Comanche life and threw her and threw her depictions in her descriptions of the way they lived the understanding of it they got a better sense of like what she missed about that life and that they had an incredible relationship with the land they lived basically just in teepees they were very nomadic they just followed around the Buffalo and they had you know what in her way of looking at it on a magical existence in comparison to this really boring life that these settlers had and when you know what she looked at it it was interesting because she was a girl who was born describe a white settler and then from the age of nine on lived as a Comanche so she had like sort of the view of Both Worlds and you know she very much took the side of the Comanches and she wanted to go back like she had spoken Comanche and in the book there's an encounter where they bring in someone who was the Comanche to speak to her and she grabs and she's like take me back we're going to leave let's get out of here now like her thought was like we got to get out of here like this way of life is b******* like I want to go back to the Comanches but she just didn't understand that that way of life was slowly going away and her son Quanah Parker who is that photograph over there that's on bullets that somebody made for me I don't even know where that came from somebody sent me that he was the last Comanche chief and they bothered during her lifetime and her son's lifetime was the last of it and it's a very sad story do the Comanches live today in Oklahoma but they do but they don't live the way they did right that means their way of life was removed mean they were wiped out Comanche still live today right in Oklahoma has quite a few of them is very cool but they do but they don't live the way they did right that means their way of life was removed mean they were wiped out</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> ulcers aren't static we're not static and I think one of the major issues that American Indians have is that we are often stereotyped into this this picture and if we don't fit that then we're not legitimately Indian rhetorical question so are you one-hundred percent Native American and that's that's let's talk about that talk about that what other so blood Quantum is an imposition from the federal government that is that has been used to weed out Native Americans so the whole the whole idea of US federal policy has to assimilate Indians to rid themselves of the Indian problem so that land and resources could be obtained right and so blood Quantum was one way that the u.s. government could do that so if you if you didn't meet what they thought was some kind of purity test then they could write you off right but that is not how many Indian nations View tribal citizenship for membership it's through other types of cultural continuity family relationships and it's not about race that's been an imposition on us so I'm polish and Choctaw absolutely absolutely Italian I'm Italian but I have a last name is Irish cuz I'm one-quarter Irish so growing up around Italians who was always like the way they made fun of me and it was like it was always a funny thing like are you sure your Italian you know like it's a purity test an ice last name with a lot of vowels you know it's a that's what they like and it's really interesting Association on American Indian Affairs we get tons of inquiries probably the top inquiry we get our people wanting to do DNA test to determine what tribe they belong to so everyone seems to want to be Indian and even some people are are emboldened enough to say I did my DNA test Native American that's a real issue that doesn't exist but there's some kind of of fantasy or myth that many people in the US have kind of believe about Indians because we don't know it's not like it's taught well in school if it's it's not like this is part of a normal dialogue identify whether you have certain genetic traits that might be from North America Canada or might be from South America as well right you have to do that genealogical research and if you know where there's 574 federally recognized tribes in about 300 other tribal groups in the United States on top of the fact that aren't recognized by the United States for many reasons and so each one of those tribes have their own laws they have their own systems of governance their own whether it's a more traditional form of government or a written constitutional government needs one of them have their own eligibility requirements for citizenship so you have to do your own genealogy and then if you do find who you may be affiliated with any that nation and you talk to them about what their eligibility requirements are some of them are residencies some of them are familial relations and some of them are blood quantum Indian federal law of art it's a legal term of Art it's a it's a defined Federal term that has a specific definition in u.s. code we tend to like to be called the nation that we belong to from south of the invisible Border North of the invisible border and and in the Western Hemisphere so it's a much broader indigenous peoples is a great great term I really want whereas the people that live on my friends live in Alberta and First Nation people can know they Dave Dunlop hunting seasons they just do whatever they want they basically say look let's just pretend like we never invaded and you just live how you would normally but with modern equipment and also it's it's a little odd but there's no getting around it. they don't have hunting seasons they just do whatever they want they basically say look let's just pretend like we never invaded and you just live how you would normally but with modern equipment episodes it's a little odd but there's no way getting around it being odd</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> when I'm asking this in terms of like if you had a magic wand what do you do with the reason why I'm asking you this is because I've thought about it I've sat down and tried to go over at myself and I don't see a solution that sits what's so strange to me is that we have Nations inside of our nation and I don't I don't want it ended and I don't want to continue it neither neither one makes sense to me like to take to end it would be to say you are assimilate you no longer have sovereignty we're going to break the last treaty and disband the reservations and make everybody just be a United States citizen that seems crazy everyone is a US citizen I'm just I'm just trying to look at it like from an overhead view like if I was an alien and I was trying to sort this out I had no no ties to either call Trevor like what are you doing with that like what do you do with that like I understand these people been massively f***** over that the genocide was perpetrated on their their their race that they were wiped out both with disease and by military actions and soldiers and treaties were broken I get it but the stay turn right now when you look at what we're talking about with these reservations are the horrific conditions in the problems of drug abuse and alcoholism and suicide and and despair and self-esteem and all these issues like what is the solution what would beat me if there was an unlimited budget like what what would you do if you were like it is President Shannon if you got elected you could win right you can be president and vice president you ran on the part of what your platform was was fixing this gigantic store that we have in this country our relationship with the tribes what would you do unlimited resources you do whatever you want I think if we were properly educated about about history I think if we really understand who native people are and their importance here and their importance to continue as Sovereign tribal Nations and it has to start it has to start with with public education we have to recreate what's important to us and I think Indian nations have have been here I think they're a symbol of of amazing Prosperity that the country could have and we've just never tapped into it and I'm I'm talking about just principles and values that that we don't seem to to hold any more in this country I feel like you're kind of being sarcastic no no no no no no no not one of the major problems we have in this country is we don't ever appreciation of nature we really don't you know we we don't look Seven Generations ahead of us to see what our decisions today or going to do to us in the future we're constantly looking for the dollar today and how that's going to reward our efforts today or not looking how you know what the lives of our children are going to look like with the lives of our great-great-grandchildren are going to look like in in and I think those are the kind of values that that we need in our country now and I think that's what's being debated in the Democratic campaign right now you know where our values are at what we want you know a hundred years from now even though their spokesperson we barely talk which is hilarious I mean to shows you how strong money and media and the influence of DNC is what would all this education do though and explain to people to the American citizens are outside the tribe how is that going to help the tribes themselves what what can be done to help these problems that we pretty detailed the problems with alcoholism the problems with suicide and despair and self-esteem all these her room conditions that exist on Mini many tribes what part of that is is is not anyone anyone's problem but ours that we have to deal with is as Sovereign Nations within our our own communities and how we how we choose to fix those issues but I think looking outside how how we can really affect change is there's something called prior and informed consent and it's in it's contained within the UN Declaration of indigenous peoples and it requires a state or government to include tribal nations in the decision-making processes that affect them so this Administration has been horrible at it absolutely horrible but need to be part we need to be the decision-makers in the things that affect us so if if you were going to a bulldoze and blow up our sacred sites to build your border wall it seems like the proper thing to do first would be to have a conversation with us in him for us to make a decision about how we may can do that a little bit better to protect those sacred sites and and natural springs in other things along along the border instead like the proper thing to do first would be to have a conversation with us in the end for us to make a decision about how we may can do that a little bit better to protect those sacred sites and and natural springs and other things along along the border instead of just blowing up everything</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> so what do when when you look at that situation the casino situation we're now all the sudden economically these tribes can Thrive and the the reservation that owns that casino can Thrive and as you're saying the money goes straight back to the reservation and to the people that run it and it ended it legitimately helps the people that live on that reservation what other things like that can be done to also take advantage of the fact that there are Sovereign Nation and allow them to economically Thrive without things like fracking and s*** that's bad for the environment other other things that are being implemented that could also help they're all different types of Economic Development going on in Indian country that can be very successful for external businesses because a benefit sitting outside business would get if they did for example manufacturing with in Indian Country they could benefit from certain tax exemptions and in and rebates that they wouldn't get in an estate so if corporations the Border or going somewhere else there would be great opportunities but and some tribes are taking advantage of those business opportunities not just gaming but out of gaming has grown a lot of a lot of investment a lot of entrepreneurial ship in tribes in a lot of the money has gone back to help educate and teach language and and ancestors and and the things that are important for that tribal Nation so there's many different ways of investment that that tribal Nations look at it it's not necessarily economic but it's about healing their people and and helping us survive in and live better than we have in the past so investment takes many forms and Indian country tribal Nations look at it it's not necessarily economic but it's about healing their people and and helping us survive in and live better than we have in the past so investment takes many forms and Indian country</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> what do you think would be best case scenario for Native Americans United States like I'll sort of give you the magic wand again like what would be best case scenario cuz the strange thing that we have in front of us here is that there is one country the United States but there's not just United States North American citizens here there's also Native Americans of various different right that have their own reservations and as you said they're Sovereign and they can come to make their own decisions what would be what's the magic wand how do you clear up all these problems associated with the mean that the horrific treatment the of everything from alcoholism to the problems with schools to self esteem issues all these problems in North America while also not that the Native Americans in the way I'm looking at it they want to stay a member of their tribe and they don't necessarily want to be just Americans they want to keep their Heritage right universally how does that how do those two things work together how do you how do we all live together in America and yet have these trucks and do it in a way that works best for everybody that's a freaking complicated asked questions even with a magic wand and not rely on others to tell our stories we need to be able to tell our stories and to reteach the general public about who Native Americans are where we've been and where we want to go Custer they've all been stories that have fed into the American politic in a certain way at certain periods of time and what I want is that this is the time now we're tribal Nations have a lot to lose and we're in a current Administration that is trying to terminate us once again what are they doing differently than other administrations they would there are a groups that are attacking the basis of federal Indian law and the rights that we do have so there's there's an act called the Indian Child Welfare Act was passed in 1970 and it's an act that the association was heavily involved in to get past and it started with some work with the Spirit Lake Sioux Tribe and a woman came to the people back then and said they took my kids they stole my children and after investigation it was found it it wasn't just happening it it Spirit Lake but it was happening all over Indian country were state welfare worker children in a disproportionate rate of quarter of all Indian children during that. Of time were taken away from their own families and adopted out to white white families and so the Indian Child Welfare act required state courts to do things before a child was taken away from its tribal Nation there are groups that are working to dismantle that and because they they think it's racist so they so it's it's like they've taken it and in an hour or looking through a backwards mirror so instead of it and to make sure that the children had ties to their culture and their families that that's not in the best interest of children so they're still looking at Indian tribes as we can't take care of her own kids that our way of life is is not acceptable and other adoptive families would be better and what's interesting is that the Indian Child Welfare act doesn't prevent it just requires a certain process to make sure that the involved in that placement adoption process and so that the child can maintain those those connections or that they try to find a family that's more culturally appropriate for the child so there's just been actually it came out of the Goldwater Institute which is a Goldwater when he was what was the senator he actually voted Indian Child Welfare act but today the Goldwater Institute is is actually funding cases around the nation to attack the Indian Child Welfare act what is the what is the reason behind what are they trying to achieve child welfare organizations around the country that say the Indian Child Welfare Act is actually the gold standard in child welfare in that that we should be utilizing those principles that are used in the Indian Child Welfare act to protect all all children to maintain familial connections</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> where was the situation that was happening during the Obama the Obama Administration where they were trying to put a pipeline through and they were hosing people down and it was on private land and they were going to private land and people are protesting it but they would never force me through anyway where was that in North Dakota and is affected by that so there are some land right issues there but we're talkin about burials and sacred areas not to mention a water quality and the tribes I'm Obama stopped at but as soon as Trump got into office he he he he pushed it forward in and did not consult with tribes and it's been a fight ever since same thing happened with they put a stop to it right before he left office right right right I'm so cynical I wonder how much of that is horseshit how much is Isaiah. You know what's going through it don't worry boys to our reservation like the majority of presidents and he did actually he was adopted into the Crow Nation I think so he adopted tribal member has visited since then that had never been done before and they actually were looking to tribes and building a government-to-government relationship that no one has are really done as well every year they would help hold a big tribal consultation in DC where tribal leaders would come from everywhere and consult with Obama and his administration it was unprecedented and the doors closed so even though he appointed assistant secretary for Indian Affairs a Tara Sweeney who's Alaska native that Administration in the department of interior and under the president has just been so close it's been hard to get anything done or to get hurt or even actually have that government-to-government relationship anymore we've been left out of a lot of the decision-making process it's going on Oliver Indian country that's a that's a very good thing to hear about Obama that he did that and so sad to hear that the Trump Administration is abandon that but it's nice to hear that someone was making an attempt to do that so what I'm getting is it really is no no long-term solution there's no solution you're saying that the trucks going to have to deal with a lot of moving parts and I think I think it you know Indian nations need to determine for themselves how best to handle the problems within their communities but outward-facing to have a strong government-to-government relationship that takes into account not just takes into account but actually require the before effect their rights or or at least some diplomacy or negotiation with varying interest before decisions are made I think that that's the heart of of what needs to happen outward-facing and also we need to take a new look at at our curriculum in schools we really need to most of our correct all of our curriculum and in public schools is about looking at Native American pre pre 1900 so and not caring that into today and who contemporary Native American tribes are and what they're doing to help their people and in what's so wonderful about Indian country today is that though there have there are some places that are extil there some anti-indian hate groups out there that fight tooth-and-nail against anything a tri-band in there kid tries to do to develop economically there are other communities where tribes have been able to bring an economic development whether that's through gaming or otherwise and by the way mean is like no other type of corporate gaming and I think a lot of people don't understand this so if you're a gambler go to Indian casinos cuz that money goes towards Indian Nation government legislated that that money from those casinos go back into Indian Nation governance and are used for jobs and employment and Social Services in all of that relieves the state and other government agencies from from having that that responsibility Oklahoma State Oklahoma Indian nations in Oklahoma about gaming trying to get more money out of game but the Governor Stitt I think is his name and he's trying to negotiate that in order to bring more money into the state so essentially trying to tax that for State purposes denying The Sovereign Nation right well in the Indian gaming regulatory act which was passed it there's so much Federal legislation it's insane of federal Indian law I mean it has its own which is their inherent sovereignty to do so this act came which was kind of a compromise tribes can do what's called Class 2 Gaming which is based on Bingo and and there's electronic bingo games that are kind of like slot machines so types in the state they have to work with the state in order to develop some kind of compacting and revenue sharing of her class 3 gaming so the state the federal government again allowed state to interfere with that inherent tribal sovereignty to regulate their own Economic Development they can that's the class 3 gaming have to do it through the state it's so strange right it's like they get no help at all and then when something comes along that allows them to economically Thrive then the governor's like hold on inferior so back again to those Watershed cases of of Justice Marshall their inferior even being able to assert jurisdiction over non-indians who come into our territory and do something wrong we can't we can't guidelines or the state government's laws the tribe does not have criminal jurisdiction over non-indians with enemy comes in and robbed the casino then the state has to take care of it</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> what what is currently a major Focus for you cultural items back to their Affiliated tribes any institution that received Federal funding or federal agencies to work towards repatriation of items that they've received overtime back to their tribes but there are also tons of ancestors and items in in international Museum so we're working on developing strategies to go after those because a lot of those countries there there has been kind of a a real thing about the purpose of museums and in public education regarding indigenous peoples and how do we decolonize these institutions and so trying to work in some countries are easier than others because if you have sacred religious items from American indigenous Societies in some museums across the waters their country considers it their cultural property so you need an act of their country's government in order to DSS in those items in and return them home so there are some countries that are much more difficult to work with than others but we're in the process of developing strategy to help we're also trying to watch private collectors and people about the importance of of returning cultural patrimony and other sacred items that received over time whether or not or is it a legal obligation to do their there's definitely an ethical and moral obligation to return these items so that their culture is can be Revitalize and let those items can be put back to use so that's one Shenzhen in foreign governments took to work on these issues sacred sites I just was before the indigenous people subcommittee in the house a few weeks ago talking about what's going on at the border and bottom they were blowing up another section you know so it sits and that is happening because there was a law in 2005 that allowed Department of Homeland Security to waive all these environmental laws and if there was an emergency to do so and so the administration is is saying that the border wall is is an emergency that allows them to waive all these environmental laws and so it's not just about protecting sacred sites all the other environmental concerns all the the animal Migration Birds plants and water quality that are being affected by the border wall because people strong like think we need a 30-foot you know tall border so it's overworking we continue to work to protect sacred sites along the border wall where where they're doing this do all amenities berries have been designated as sacred science and so is that what you're saying they don't identify the bones New York for the rest of the culture that might have existed there and identify it was clearly about how do we protect and how do we make sure that the tribal consultation and other options can be presented so that the environment and other areas are pretty and the Republican Congressman that was there it was really quite seems like a nice guy basically said there is more damage caused by migrant traffic trash and defecating then there is by blowing up the ground and so that is the part interior Homeland Security and and republicans in Congress are saying about that border wall stop and think about how ridiculous you can pick up trash you can pick up s*** you can't pick up once you blow up sacred sites bones forever and replaceable these are irreplaceable resources definitely challenged him about that but you know it's I think the laws on their side is it safe to say that there's many areas that you're talkin about along the border that are probably undiscovered cuz you're at you're dealing with things that are potentially thousands of years old. Remember undiscovered has different meanings so people do not that they try to protect and so that's why consultation is so important and working with tribe so you can understand what's going on on the ground but usually they do some kind of of of minor investigation and supposedly that was done that is being dumb but nothing's being done to protect it so it's this is this area is essentially a burial ground from a thousand years ago and our ancestors use this all that school story we're going to put a wall here and those opportunities for public comments comment have been completely waived those stories always weird me out when someone's building an apartment building and they stopped construction because they found some sort of a burial site or anything like how many of those are out there I mean how many how many areas where people are digging into the ground they are going to find some incredible archaeological Discovery and it's it's getting you know smash by a bulldozer a lot of our a lot of the context for what was happening here before Europeans came is gone because we just destroyed all the evidence of it you know so that's why I often the archaeological investigations have have move forward is as they look at discrete sites without connecting the dots in a more holistic about o what's happened in a certain area so all most of our archaeological context and all that evidence is gone and it continues to be looted by amateur archaeologists and of course you know I've worked on many different developments across the country where different developments across the country where you know the bulldozers come into the Phil</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you hear an origin story like the one we were talking about people coming out of the earth what how do you decipher that well I've actually been to that origin site and it looks like a female it's a place where we were birthed it it it's at a beautiful amazing and almost shocking place in Mississippi kids that were no longer connected with and it's our lives today or so out of context with the natural world that we don't know it's possible anymore we've been so separated from that Rose's you think that's possible though that seems highly unlikely there cuz I'll give you if you had money to bet I give you a thousand bucks and you can put it on this or that you can put it on well we probably people got here by all sorts of means the way people got Everywhere by all sorts of means or they came out of the ground like flowers or Adam and Eve stories that they create our identity they create who we are at the center of our being and they have lessons to teach us and they also remind us what we're responsible for and that's what I'm saying that we've been so separated from that part of us and our connection to the natural world into the Earth from the Earth we were put in certain places to be responsible and care take for that area so a lot of these stories what they're they're essentially trying to connect people with the idea that they are part of this great Earth they're part of this beautiful ecosystem and maybe this origin story is devised to sort of explain to them in a way that makes a clear connection is that make sense absolutely absolutely but but but it's but it's part of who many tribal nations are this is our place this is our homeland this is what we're responsible for and we haven't been able to do what we were put here to do our purpose has been ripped away from us so so a lot of the work we do is to try to you know work Birds environmental healing and try to bring lands back into our land holding so that we can care take for that land that's not that's not all over there are some places in Indian country that extract the environment people for the environment and nations are sovereign the tribes are sovereign so they get to decide what's best for them and whether they're going to be sustainable or not</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> look at the future of Native American tribes in the United States and again as you said you know Native Americans that are in these reservations are United States citizens but it's it's such an unusual situation that really really have a comparison to Canada with their first Nations what what do you think happens in the future what when you go from 1900 you were talking about the the path of 1902 today abysmal hundred twenty years other than the economic success of the casinos what do you what do you anticipate happening in the next hundred years it's it's hard to tell I know a lot of tribes have been diversifying their Economic Development without or cultures were won't survive in fact many elders and you may have read it and in Black Elk speaks that no longer who we are without our culture without our languages in likely will no longer be recognized by the federal government unless we are Indian enough things are really important to who we are in the next hundred years and I think it's it's those things that we will be rebuilding of the next hundred years healing from the last and and moving forward with a new-found understanding of who yarn and a stronger identity in NN self what that actually looks like an and what's important I think that we are so still so dependent on the great white father and what happens with us politics and whether we have a voice there or not we've got great organizations that help advocate for Indian Country in general National Congress of American Indians which has been around for about 75 years and it helps Lobby and educate Congress and keeps tribes informed about what's going on in politics and advocate for many of those interests there groups like ours that are advocating for more cultural revitalization and strengthening ID and protecting our use so I think part of what we've been building is is really a coalition of of organizations and and tribes to strengthen who we are and kind of correct the misfortunes of our history I know we we still have Tribal Nations out there that where are living with egregious poverty and hand and issues that still seems so far away from being corrected but you know like my grandma always said where there's hope where there's life there's hope so I think we just continue to I mean weaves freaking survived for this long and this coronavirus isn't going to take us out either I mean we're going to continue to to tipis forward and and and try to have a better future for our kids just like anybody else just like anybody else and I think that's that's what's important is that we're not were not on the stage with everyone else we're not at the table where decisions are being we're not in the room where it happens but we respect them as a culture like they're they're thought of as we're not invading Mexico and I'm saying and whether or not you agree we're not looking at them as something and fit we're looking at them is another country we don't look at Native Americans the same way we look at maybe it's because you are also United States citizens they would look at them the same way we have the same like the respect for people that live in a Sovereign Nation another Sovereign Nation you know this is a Sovereign Nation inside of our nation it doesn't I think you would agree doesn't get the same respect that other Sovereign Nation 500 absolutely we have the same like the respect for people that live in a Sovereign Nation another Sovereign Nation even though this is a Sovereign Nation inside of our nation it doesn't I think you would agree doesn't get the same respect that other Sovereign Nation 500 absolutely</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> thanks too-big-to-fail the banks failed in the people fail unbelievable man being all this s*** that we're spending the Venezuela's s*** all these sanctions it is Venezuela coup I mean were you following not that was insane walls falling it as much as you were sort of putting as much you were putting a very alternative you supposed to like what we're saying and either left or right-wing publication and then you face a lot of resistance because of that right right but you were there yes yes I was there and that's why I knew with my own I mean I saw with my own eyes the reality on the ground and what do you think is happening over there so what is happening over there I mean if you pull Venezuelan themselves they will say that their quality of life has lessened because of us sanctions to back in 2015 Obama declared Venezuelan national security threat very random there was no threat opposed to the US but it was just a kind of start the sanctions on them but who knows who knows pressure I mean there's always been pressured because of course of us is always hated Maduro and hated Hugo Chavez and the US Empire doesn't forget and it doesn't forgive and you know going back to 2002 Busch tried to engineer a coup against Hugo Chavez that didn't work and so what we've done with these Civil Society organizations is trying to foment radical discontent on the ground in Venezuela you know get some sort of Uprising the guy one why do was just some guy plucked from obscurity who was just well known in Georgetown in Washington DC much more well-known there then he wasn't even in Venezuela so you know this was completely engineered it was totally concocted no Venezuelans really knew who he was I think like 80% of Venezuelans have no idea who won why do was but the economy went into a spiral because oil prices dropped they would have been able to pick back up their economy but unfortunately the sanctions were so debilitating that it went to complete free-fall Venezuela's not a socialist country that's actually a vast majority is Private Industry and a lot of those private CEOs are very anti-government long story short is that the coup was initiated you know during the Trump Administration after he slapped like 70 sanctions on Venezuela and we're talking about medicine food all the things that they're saying that they right there trying to Stage these fake Aid Caravan deliveries I was all bulshit what they're doing is actually preventing the delivery from food and medicine from getting to Venezuela and then this crew was a failure because the resilience of the Venezuelan people they believe that they have a democracy they do have a democracy it's actually more free than our democracy there's not a dictatorship there Maduro won the presidential election last year he won the presidential election that us lobbied the opposition candidates to not run against him so then they can say it was that was a dictatorship and so he want he won the popular vote and they tried to implement all these things and they've been blocked and the opposition keeps crying to the us that they need help that they need to be invaded it's pretty disturbing when you have opposition candidate stain slap sanctions on us invade our country help us Trump help us I mean it's absolutely ridiculous but when I was on the ground I saw a flourishing democracy I saw dozens of people hundreds of people who said that they the process there that they believe in the bolivarian movement and that their tra'ves mode till death and we don't understand because those people's voices are totally censored from corporate media the only Venezuelan that we hear from and corporate media are rich opposition either you know expats or people who just have fled and what do we hear from corporate corporate take so this is even Elizabeth Warren even Bernie Sanders has been terrible on this I mean it's it's really bad I mean their take on a corporate media if you're looking at Fox News they'll say we need to overthrow Maduro and and everyone's starving and it's a failed State they never mention the sanctions they never mention the fact that us sanctions just from 2017 alone has killed 40,000 Venezuela's this was just a study out by steeper 40,000 Venezuelan have died from Trump's sanctions from insulin shipments not getting there primarily a lot of other things medicine the people have not been getting and they are dying so that is absurd and I we we like to think of sanctions as kind of like the soft power that just Target delete that the country know it's an act of war and that's exactly what's happening to Iran and Trump's implemented sanctions all over the world in a really devastating way but but the corporate media will say we to overthrow them their failed State their you know there a dictatorship reality know they're not their democracy and they we don't like their politics that's really what it is their politics are politics are that they nationalized the oil and that's really where it comes from this fake Ambassador that was trying to get into the embassy here Carlos Vecchio he's an XX on lawyer and you see all these people who are involved in ExxonMobil and all the oil industries that were flourishing in Venezuela before Chavez got up got elected and they just want their profits back they want their money back they don't like the fact that Chavez took the profits from the oil companies that's what that's what the the problem is Joe and it's amazing it's amazing how transparent it is so ever since these failed coup attempts over the last decade the US has been fomenting regime change through the Civil Society organizations usaid offshoots in the country and I'm basically trying to foment violent unrest violent unrest of the extent that they burn down streets there's lynch mobs I mean when I was there during the height of the violence in 2017 like 200 people died news just kept saying like insinuating that Maduro was going out there with police forces and actually gunning down people in the streets it couldn't be further from the truth we looked at all the deaths we broke then I'll down we looked at death records and we found out that the opposition lynch mobs are actually responsible for the overwhelming majority of deaths in the streets so that's happening people get lynched for being black they get lunch for being Chubbies now these people are targeting maternity clinics hospitals basically any Enclave of government services because that's what this is about it's about I'm kind of a fascistic bent of the opposition wanting to take back the power from the poor the poor people got power and they didn't like it and that's what the Crux of the problem is but when you're looking at the corporate media it's an absurdly cartoonish brush that's being painted and if you look at the liberal media with Maddow and all these other people they either don't talk about it or they say Maduro needs to let the Aiden even saw Bernie and Elizabeth Warren say Maduro needs to let the Aiden let the Aiden Maduro the 8th was the Kool-Aid was was a trick they're getting 8 everyday from countries that are not trying to actively overthrow them but we staged this big stunts on the border of Columbia and by the way Columbia is actually suffering more than Venezuela Colombia is in dire poverty there's people getting assassinated every week who are labor leaders and teachers I went there and I talked to a teacher who is living in Exile cuz you scared for his f****** life but we don't hear about that right because of their allies with the US so it's cynical stunt to try to get this humanitarian International outcry to say oh my God people are dying people are hungry it's not a matter of that there's no food is that food is very expensive because there's an actual economic War being waged by Massive corporations in the country and just external entities Weatherby the Trump Administration or us multinationals that RX fixating preventing Aid in food from coming in and the aid of their they're claiming that they need to excel basically a hoax at the stunt on to try to get the regime change to to happen we just saw Richard Branson stage some ridiculous big concert on the border of Columbia and they had like what they said were Aid trucks on this big bridge and got CNN on the ground being like it was it was fake it was a truck full of like I don't know like very miniscule things but they wanted to try to Ram these trucks through how to get the soldiers up in arms and try to get them to the fact it hasn't worked they've been trying over and over again to try to get something going and basically at the end of the day what happened was just a giant money grab it was basically a money laundering scheme you look at these people who are the opposition leaders now one why do Carlos pecchio they've just stolen all the money back maybe they realize the crew wasn't going to go forward but they basically ended up stealing at least 70 million dollars in just putting it right in these people's bank account pretty shocking I mean you have international as an international conspiracy to try to take the money back from from the people whose money was was basically administered by Maduro friends at all the poor I mean poor people got a voice and I never had a voice in that country their entire lives and not country was you know it was a colonial holdover and to the bolivarian movement started Midol across Latin America and it was scary was a giant threat to the US establishment and actually that's why I tell us where was founded tell us where the the the organization that I used to sell the show to it was started as kind of a counter to This Global hegemony and his corporate narrative trying to overthrow a democratically elected leaders but it's shocking when you see like the bank of England seized all of this gold that was rightfully maduro's They seized it illegally all of these days send International body just stole all this money and they just gave it to these opposition leaders so even though the opposition leaders weren't able to take you no take the power back in the country they still have taken all the money and no one's talking about that and everyone just acting like this is some crazy dictatorship that needs are saving how dare you do we think we are I'm really going into the nuts and bolts of what the economic crisis really is and my partner Mike Risner did epic take down of John Oliver you know the liberal media is just as bad John Oliver did some f****** absurdly false kind of like analysis of the whole Venezuela situation and we just went through and debunked every single line of it I mean it was extremely disingenuous I bet he had someone who wrote All right so I bet he probably has no real knowledge nor could you really unless you extensively started at the way you have and especially if you have feet on the ground right I think that most people just in order to understand a complex nuanced problem like some sort of an international conflict that were involved in that has to do with nationalizing oil like God damn you going to do a lot of work do you do if you run a show like last week tonight or whatever it was called Define that with a lot of these so-called online experts when you talk to them one-on-one and you get them off the Record without notes like they're just people there's this guy that u n human rights investigator named Alfred de zayas that I did this big interview with and he said he tried to propose this to the UN saying there is no no humanitarian crisis there this is all fake yes people are suffering and dying but it's not because of maduro's policies and Corruption because of us sanctions that exceeded the economy in Peru any sort of recovery from taking place and the economy still in free-fall they can't work with International bodies again we have the threat of sanctions with institutions that now work with Venezuela so they've been isolated they've been isolated from the world so was the idea that they just put these sanctions employees allowed this political unrest take Play support the opposition and then just have a slow burn until it all collapses and swoop in and fix everything and make it a part of the United States government and then these people will not have the flu any longer and another thing that they hate is that maduro's given 2 million free homes to people that's something that's completely unheard of to maybe Americans but that's one thing that one why do said that he would do he immediately implemented a new hydrocarbons law or he was proposing to implement a new hydrocarbons law which is again in ovary privatizing the oil and also just immediately privatizing all of the social services that Maduro and Chavez did so it it's it's pretty shocking what would happen I'm pretty devastating what would happen if if y dos could you did succeed and the whole Trump Administration I mean it's not just Venezuela its Nicaragua and Cuba to I mean we can't go to Cuba anymore we have to create some genocide or blockade that prevents food and medicine from getting in there to what was the whizzer adjustable did they say why they're doing this while they're imposing these new laws it just John Bolton's bizarre speech about the Troika of tyranny number the number the axis of Evil Nicaragua that is weird one right the Cuba ones is what what has happened over there nothing actually give out free HIV prevention pills and they act up which big Pharma it's so difficult because it's so new ones but that's you know I encourage everyone to maybe check out venezuelanalysis and Empire files and tell us or if they want to learn more about that situation</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> yeah I think you nailed it when you said the 2016 elections of sort of the awakened this reptile brain cuz that's what it seems like you're seeing you seeing so many people to think that there's a war going on like a war in this country right instead of discussing things they don't want to discuss things down that's part of some of the motivation behind in justification for deplatforming people wiping them out like remove them get them out you know we're at War right now we have to fix this we have to get a woman right game and you know like this kind of s*** but you see like they they feel like they're in ideological war that's why identity politics is so fascinating because it's just been adopted by The Establishment by the liberal wing of the establishment to try to Electric people that were somehow a progressive society that it's all just like corporatism with you know under the flag in the banner of like social politics and identity politics and it's completely absurd I mean with Barack Obama we thought that we were in racial Society cuz we had a black president and we know that that's absolutely a falsehood so I just think that we're just going down the wrong path here and neoliberalism has really done a number on this country in the world and we're going to see kind of more authoritarian fascist policies take root because people are really down and out with with how capitalism has morphed and has strangled basically the economy it's really disturbing because you know you're looking at like left identity politics but it's under the banner of capitalism so really it's just about privatization neoliberalism is just about privatization so it's not about like leftist you know social is politics Bernie Sanders is not a socialist he's a Democratic Socialist which means that he just wants social democracy he's not talking about abolishing private Industries not talking about nationalizing anything you just talked about having workers have a seat at the table and getting share so we're just kind of gone off the Wayside of like rhetoric and we just have no idea how to talk about these things in like a fairway because things are so heated and ideological and people are just blinded I think and don't really understand these issues well enough and it's really disturbing because we're at a point in our country where we need to have conversations we don't just want sound bites but going back to the center shifts the consolidation of corporate media people don't have the platform they don't have the voice to get these ideas out there which is why your show is so important I mean having people like me like Tulsi I mean bringing out these Concepts and and Shifting the Consciousness is very very important when people are hearing the same thing over and over and over again from one side and then an opposite view over and over again from Another Side it's it's very difficult to have and understanding what the f*** is going on it's it's very confusing to most people and I think they tend to either just give up or they tend to just find whatever side seems to get them the most social credit or the most most to reasonable the perspective in their terms like is whether it's left-wing or right-wing and then just support that just just given to that and then just have this pattern that they adopt this this conglomeration of opinion adopt and then they're so busy with our jobs are so busy with your family so busy with his wife and then all this other s*** when you're saying you know the deregulation all this other s*** you're seeing when the stuff that caused the banking crisis that stuff all the stuff is going on and it's going on without their knowledge it's all happening underneath the surface and then something erupts like the economic collapse of 2007/2008 and they like what the f*** is happening I didn't see this coming now the economy crashes we have to buy out all these f****** Banks and then then it rebuild back up and people are still doing the same goddamn thing they're still working and trying to get ahead and try it and then all this is happening behind the scenes and it's so incredibly difficult to pay attention to all of it develop a nuanced perspective of what the problems are how to fix them and then who was actually going to support a real tangible solution versus who's just saying some Elizabeth Warren type s*** to get elected the streets because there's no person who's going to change this there's no top-down you no implementation that's really going to revolutionize society and get people living wage and get people Healthcare even Bernie said I'm not going to be able to do this I need you to come out to get my back but yeah I mean there's nowhere in the country that you can live if you're living on minimum wage and actually afford a two-bedroom apartment I mean that's the reality here but when we bailed out the banks in 2008 no one had a Reddit about how we're going to pay for that I mean it was just it was just kind of understood okay we're going to pay and give the banks the bailout what about f****** us don't we deserve a bailout what the people and give the banks the bailout what about f****** us do we deserve a bailout about the people in the people fail</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> yeah it's it's it's sick I mean you texted me that video of the kid you know another medic was just shot so there's something crazy. Bilal Muhammad Uso brother UFC fighters out of his Instagram and I texted you that it's so against another so difficult that put their head in the sand and don't want to look at some of these atrocities and don't want to look at some of the video you sent me a soldier shooting at people that are not doing anything right I mean yeah I mean their whole argument is that it's all Hamas and they're human Shields any we looked through hundreds of hours of footage that these people gave us and it's mind-blowing footage it looks absolutely cinematic and epic but the footage is heroin and I didn't see one weapon I didn't see one not one weapon it was literally people with slingshots throwing rocks at tanks kind of a Rite of it's very symbolic they're not trying to hurt anyone no Israeli soldiers have been hurt or killed during 2018 which is what the film looks at his is through 2018 of the great March of return and there's not any weapon there's no militants Hamas has nothing to do with these with the March and it just shocking I mean it's shocking how many war crimes were committed on camera and it just amazing the propaganda that's just told to us about what this is and why they have the right to kill people that posed no threat to them when you were on last time we talked about this one of my email accounts was flooded with literally a chain letter the same letter like denouncing you and your lies and your anti-semitic protective in your anti-israeli perspective it was it was weird because it was the same email AstroTurf gas fake now that the campaign what has a lot of money behind it yeah that's a lot of money behind that I mean the film is mind-blowing go to Gaza fights for freedom.com if you want to check it out when it when it gets released and it just really on incontrovertible Joe I mean even if it were a war between armies all of these things that Israel is done are still documented war crimes and very Grievous violations of international law and were talking about direct targeting and assassinations by Israeli snipers of disabled full of children rest and Medics and that's what who resigned was she was a medic and as you mentioned another medic just passed away was killed rather I hate to use the passive voice cuz you always hear Palestinians died know they were murdered her whole being murdered by snipers and they pose no threat to them and so the film looks at this you went investigation basically during the march in 2018 and documents all of the Grievous crimes and atrocities conducted by the Israeli military and I mean you know Palestine has a right to defend itself and this isn't even what that is but if you look at the UN Charter of 1978 they say that you know occupied people's and besiege people have the right actually for armed self-defense and in the fact that this is not even want that is that there's literally people going out there in peace with their bare chest holding flags and they're getting killed and and sniped there's so many amputations I mean just in 28 phone numbers 35 kids were killed 900 shot the kid who went up to the fence and just put a Palestinian flag and she was shot in the head and died instantly it just goes on and on and on and so you know we're just trying to document this to really kind of push the needle for accountability because these laws have been agreed upon by the International Community some of the 100 years ago and I have kind of a rogue State acting with complete impunity knowing that it has Total Protection from the US Empire and given more freedom than ever under Trump with this Golan Heights thing and the moving of the Jerusalem Embassy or the moving of the embassy to Jerusalem I mean it's just it's abysmal and it needs to be stopped and no they can't control the narrative any longer because we're seeing this with our own eyes and that's what this film does is really lays it all out have you concentrate focus on so many different f*****-up part of your world but you sell your very friendly and upbeat like see like you're laughing at this how do you manage to maintain your sanity because I I I have a hard time if I just watch one of your pieces I watch one of your clips and I just got bought the rock I just want to cry and I don't know what to do and I want to hug my kids but you're in this year in the trenches every day and you go to these places all the time how do you how do you do it well I think that well first of all I go and Camp a lot I can denature a lot which is also kind of depressing knowing that you know climate change and blah blah but I try to get out and see the beauty of the world and understand my privilege especially as an American citizen because I don't have we can't afford to not be aware and we can't afford to not be educated and talking about these issues especially when our government is subsidizing this around the world 10 million dollars everyday what are tax dollars you know I mean this is this is going on and it's so close to home and we have to acknowledge our privilege and acknowledge the situation which is we have agency we have agency to Lobby our government to change this and to stop these criminal Acts it's so close to home and we have to acknowledge our privilege and acknowledge the situation which is we have agency we have agency to Lobby our government to change this and

		<div class="paragraph"> CNN Fox News all that I know you hate somebody but what if they just know they create kind of this this Panic what if they just on 24/7 car crashes and people die from obesity and you know we be f****** terrified we be terrified f****** bones in the mountains and f****** in Norway people would believe it they could do you like they found Santa Claus bones disease is just jumping the people he said that it happens all the time and can't control it Corona slow down booties for the lack of testing there might be way more people with it so it shows it how how it's not that deadly to know how many people died that's for sure but we don't know how many people have it so it could be less than the only thing the flu to I mean if this is supposed to be ten times more potentially 10 times more deadly than the flu right is what the worst case scenario predictions brains as to what is causing this and is there another way to generate food I'll talk to because when we're old and we're not 80s the kids during those times are going to look at this is weird because like old people love toilet paper they just talking about toilet paper like avian flu that was bird agriculture swine flu that was a pig agriculture when they Jam all these animals together occasionally one of those f****** bugs with jump ahead with plans are the ones that jump coronavirus food wide this does seem like a massive overreaction Trump confirmed coronavirus in Cook-Out it's just a bad motherfuker though that guy throws horror movie it's a horror movie Aspirus series well there's some real dangers that it might be as much as 10 to 15 times stronger media is running with us because it's bad for Trump I didn't kill the economy has made the virologist have that in mind when they make their decisions I think all these millions of people smallpox this is what they do they try to stop a lot of diseases are trying to kill us every f****** day it is if we have a war and there's a war against viruses it's a real war against nothing but we don't think of it as a thing because it's it's you but it's I'm learning how to find many people how many people have died in the US so far if it was like the zombie apocalypse from an old folks home in Washington you know something like wait a minute the average age is 8230 of the first round 229 to 28 to 27 to 26 225 so if you want to sync it up or watch John makdessi vs trinaldo Francisco tonight it is a weird thing to see no audience and it's a weird thing to think that so many people are so afraid of this that they don't do anything and go out but it kind of makes sense if it's as bad as they think it is now if it's not as bad as I think it is the problem is just going to be a lot of people are not going to believe them but next one thing comes up to the next Wednesday I know I wouldn't I know I wouldn't know I don't know I don't think it's the history of viruses in the United States and in the world or the Spanish flu right that was really bad for young guys with rate at 23 or something I hear you describe what the disease was a guy just woke up from a coma and that Mike NBA cancel there's nobody at the UFC my my my thing is maybe they were trying to get it does the scientist CDC might be saying let's stop a peak in cases that overwhelm hospitals not infrastructure cuz we don't have the infrastructure to deal with this come on down right now by hand sanitizer nobody nobody addicted to drugs are there life fell apart all these all these things to be contributors right but you're not responsible for them and pretend that we are and we just leave them there is ridiculous like it like if someone would just littering where they are and just throwing shade in the street throwing needles and sweet arrest them but but you don't arrest them and they're setting up camps under these Bridge like this is nonsense cheap housing for people as well as medical help housing for people are Smokers Choice Medical help</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> does it take to develop a vaccine for this coronavirus question I I don't mean to sound glib again but I can make a vaccine for overnight the questions is it safe and effective and that's the challenge we have right now questions about how do you make immunity to a coronavirus and what kind of vaccine do you have to have that brings in all the different parts of the immune system so we don't know that yet so some of this research there's a condition in humans called antibody-dependent enhancement adee and it turns out that if you have no antibody or immune response your gets a disease if you have a lot you're protected in between level and then you get the disease it actually enhances the disease immune response is really destructive and in fact there was a couple years ago got the vaccine actually may just a little bit of antibody and when they got the real disease it made him a lot sicker and so we found with the 2003 SARS vaccine that there was an ATV component to it when we made it in animals and so we're going to have to really study this to be sure it's safe and as you said earlier you know we can surely make mistakes we don't you know we need not too and so I think between getting the effectiveness on the safety data together I mean maybe this is not going to happen soon you know it's wishful thinking you every time I mean I go back to Cyrus in 2003 and look at every event zika 2015 we settle will have a vaccine for in no time. Are 5 years later vaccine and so this is one of the challenges we have we have to complete the job you know it's like we start on something and then we forget that it's important because it kind of goes away for a while but only to come back and so this is part of that picture we talked about this with Peter hotez you know we got to finish the job on these things you know I worry that we'll get through this situation and then people say all we're done and then we'll forget until the next one comes along and so so this is where vaccine research and development is really important how do they test for safety come up with a potential vaccine how do they make sure that it's safe what you do it gradually first 30 humans you know they volunteer willingly knowing to see what kind of reactions they have really bad people that are in jail and practice on them a lot of people before you know that the chance you might find that Brian 30 people for a while and it's just a joke and you say it's like if the Iowa farmer wanted a harvested corn and half the time it doesn't mean by planting twice as many acres you can do that in April you still can't Harvest October</div>

Pump filter it's it's definitely bad flu in in some people's accounts in that it's causing some serious damage we got there Jamie oh it's it causes damage to lungs and brain damage saying we're all going to get it in one of the reasons why this is a real tricky one is that the symptoms don't show up for a while so you can be contagious for a long time and I wish I had it 3 weeks ago something like a million five hundred thousand chickens it's honest article and they just shut everything down there like this is fixed it this is something that's going to f****** kill half the population legitimately kill out the populations Arkham Washington Post that that gets like a bunch of experts and the kind of what the things that you agree on about the coronavirus and when you read that makes you feel better more than 50% of the cases that are serious like hospitalization are people that are under which is very unusual because the other people in other places that we there they're reporting this mostly older people with underlying health conditions weak immune system weak immune systems people with high blood pressure but you know you really should stop and look at the numbers of just the flu and this is supposed to be way worse than the flu but if you look at the numbers for the flu the flu kills a fuckload of pains a motherfuking 50000 in Euro reporting this mostly older people with underlying health conditions weak immune system weak immune systems people with high blood pressure but you know you really should stop and look at the numbers of just the flu and this is supposed to be way worse than the flu but if you look at the numbers for the flu the flu kills a fuckload of pains a motherfuking 50000 in Euro</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Vault the game looks like to tell everybody who you are what you do is you do Martin and I'm the game director on Doom Eternal of Doom Eternal he showed us the game and show in ran through the sum of the first level holyfuck goddamnit so next level it's so next level graphics Regina my life it's awesome it's but it's okay because of the violence against demon yeah totally and and we we we work hard on that like you never there's no cursing that I have three kids there's no cursing there's no sex I do want it to be something that my nine-year-old could play don't you think it's kind of crazy that you could rip people's heads off you can shove their arm down their throat you could cut them in half that's fine just don't use any of those naughty word kids yes because I was joking with something the other day it's like my kids like he's not going to go to somebody in like Glory kill them but when someone says they will glow with like a Shader on them and that means you can go in to do a melee finisher basically which is like a a melee attack and you'll get help from in there there's really really cool animations so crazy like when my kids see that they're not going to do that but when they hear someone use the F-word they're like oh I could use that in everyday life and and that sucks so that would be awesome it is cartoonish violence so if you could be at its very much like a cartoon the first one with ID software we've had Carmack in before he's no longer with yes software but is will it still there no he's not there like whole sequence looks like I was like a CGI movie it doesn't look like gameplay like remember when we used to play games and used to have that opening scene there was like a video and then it would go to the game was crude this game is exactly like the opening scene which is so crazy no pre-rendered that everything those are the in-game assets that's how good they are the team is like insane the guys are true artist Craftsman you know like they just go crazy on the details and when you zoom in with the camera for the cinematics they completely hold up the rigging like it's like a feature film it's nuts are you guys there is right now let's play Let's play the the the old Taylor this is the old trailer me too know if you just listening this is just annoying music and noise but if you're watching it looks f****** sick 100 Angels Angels 2000 Jesus waste of time for people 3:20 so that's when it comes out it was 9 days from now yes that guy if your Bruce Lee that is your Chuck Norris yeah and you guys are going to admit the whole scene actually when you meet him there which is a little kid from that really inspired by that Tina is it Enter the Dragon or Return of the Dragon when he fights Chuck Norris yeah or for the Star Wars fans your Obi-Wan and that's your Darth Maul in the prequels were amazing they were really good yes I've watched the one against Obi-Wan and Anakin like a million times like I love that one it's so good like when they in the wild in Chittenango off on each other in like it is to make George described it in an interview that it would be like you would be seeing a Jedi at their Peak that that really in the first three Star Wars films they were not at their Peak and then in the prequels you would see them in their Prime you know I'd like kicks in his prime so like that's what's so cool about that fight that Bonnie Tyler it's amazing yeah well what you guys have done is create something that's going to ruin people's lives I hope you really excited about massive waste of time I mean we're talking before the show about video games in the addictive quality of video games I have a real problem I just can't play them that much yes in every now and then and then I shake my head and I got to go running or something cuz otherwise it'll get the grip on me video game. Cuz you're like in the movie and it looks like a f****** movie now and you see what the glory kills like you are your own fight choreographer if you're sick of Break In the arm and shoving it in his head then swing around from behind and cut them in half you know like you anything you want it's awesome what is unique about our single player is that it will give you the same Buzz that a multiplayer will give you because you're this time are the AI that opening level that's why I felt so you're messing with like easy dudes later on it will continue to level up and as you saw like that guy that comes out with the acts like again he is he is as tough as you are so you will get the same feeling from the single-player that you do from a multiplayer times one-on-one you run around the map and collect your rocket launchers in your ammo and armor and s*** and just f*** each other up we have a multiplayer Cold battle mode that is f****** awesome like it's really really good and then like Quake multiplayer looks no different is very unique the last multiplayer we made was not super well received it was a really competent good multiplayer but it was Doom 2016 multiplayer experience but it really wasn't Innovative enough like fans yes I do something new so we basically took the single-player experience that combat loop at your master and then we would give you away to do with your friends it's a 2 V1 so it's up to you guys versus one guy gets to be the Slayer with all the guns and it's really really cool and then there's Invasion so like you'll play the single-player campaign and then someone can become a demon like Jamie could become a demon and then invade you while you're playing you won't know where he is and I'll just come out and try to f*** with you like it's really cool but is there anyone but battle mode the closest we beat that we come to the one on one is to be one instead of one versus one you know it's the balance there no one demon can stand against the Slayer you know the doomguy is all-powerful he's got all these down it's right here he's got all the guns and the mods and he's at 8. secret spot to hit his arms are like trees so like that there were other men other jelly donuts is like a sword and the bicep just like his butt but anything like that in the future like that you never know like certainly will see but but we're really really proud of this like I think what you want to do is you got to innovate if if you want to make something that's really going to engage people like that fit like the whole point is to like give them something to master that they've never seen before cuz if you're just asking me to master a new version of a thing that I already mastered sure a lot of people would appreciate that but you're not really going to capture like a large audience so we really created something I was completely unique I'm so excited that now is there going to be a deathmatch mode where like all of us can get a room and f*** each other up by now or pillars of like we needed a lot of drama then I had a lot of pacing like that variations and pacing in the match and something with deep strategy so and and was primarily Innovative like unlike anything any anything anybody had played before and was like it's a multiplayer for people who love Doom Eternal Soul play the Doom Eternal single player you'll like this like an awesome Graphics are so off-the-charts I don't play this right now because I know I'm looking at this video to Jamie's playing showing the video of this guy playing in The Other Guys</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> yes when did you guys start on this about four years ago so it's been 4 years of steady work to make something like 10 in 9 days we're going to like give it to the world yes I'm like oh my God yes I'm just now they say that it's four days and you start exhibiting symptoms so okay I coughed at the airport and people looked at me like I felt almost wanted to apologize I was just clearing my throat I didn't cover my mouth everybody was like yeah it was last week with the fans like lines of fans and the beginning everybody was touching elbows that lasted like 20 minutes and if we were just high five trying to give you Knuckles and that you had but fifty and up or something or like it's the real problem is people with respiratory issues people who are overweight and and people who are old does a does a real problems refit and he is now on a ventilator and he was in Italy I don't know the specifics you know sometimes look like I've got the flu before and I'm sure you has have as well and sometimes what happens is your worn down from travel you're worn down maybe from drinking you warm down from too much exercise and then it gets you and then if you're not like and this is just the common cold and apparently the common cold is a type of coronavirus make sure that's true I'm pretty I was reading up on coronavirus is last name was like what is a type of coronavirus is this just here now forever like this is a part of the world like coronavirus question well Michael osterholm who wrote This Book deadliest enemy and who was on on Tuesday on the podcast Tuesday he opened up a lot of people's eyes as to like what what the issue is and what what you what you can do to prevent it but those wet markets that they have in China or just bananas man with the f****** bats on the tables and coronavirus or a large family of viruses that cause sentences ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Eeyore SARS a novel coronavirus is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans so zoonotic or xonotic meaning they are transmitted between animals and people so what was happening is these four wet markets he was detailing how they have chickens that are in one cage and civets that are above the chickens and civets are shiting on the chickens and chickens are eating the civet s*** and oh my goodness is like it's just a perfect environment to create a disease is going to jump from one species to the next that is scary yeah and he's like in many of them with jump to humans I mean all the major whether it's avian flu that's from bird swine flu obviously from pigs they jump from farm animals or from these people and they're not going to stop us markets so it's like people by their food which is just crazy and making the videos and pictures of what they look like over there know that seems scary though Rock concrete bats laid out with their mouth open they look cartoonish didn't even look real and they have no wings at James oh my God and over there look how big these bats die trying to kill you and they're going to they're going to cook those that is how this disease got started if you're hungry eat a bat you could Glory kill that thing and get help that would be good as well so don't eat bats kids I mean that's one of the things that China is doing what they have to do there's too many people not enough food and a lot of what they're eating is just we wouldn't imagine eating it or are you not traveling because of this change and s*** that's my wife asked me a lot like she she was really concerned about me coming here and I was like we got sell again so I just got back from Vegas and I was a little nervous while I was over there but I did everything normal I went to work out you know I-81 to the fights which is 20,000 people at the T-Mobile Arena all stuffed into this one area and everybody was acting normal our brothers high five Fighters mean outbreak yeah I am I'm worried about old people I'm worried about my parents for sure I'm willing to help people are overweight you know I have friends that are not healthy to Mayberry she'd lose some weight and I'm worried about them I'm worried about people with respiratory problems you know a good friend of mine has a daughter by cystic fibrosis the train he canceled his tour shout out to Everlast he canceled his tour because of that I mean that he's got a real concern serious lung condition that is really scary people that he's got no choice he has to stay home and play it safe and I think a lot of people going to do that you know it's going to be interesting to see how the government handles it was one of things about love or hate Trump he's willing to do some s*** that's a lot of people think would be unpopular like closed down traffic yeah closed down flights coming in from other countries that are infected that have high rates of infection you know I mean I wonder what they're going to do and something the really radical has to be done to try to start the slow down this this f****** Illness but I don't know what they can do are we waiting for it to watch your show at this guy are we waiting for it to go away like I read a quote that like when the weather changes it'll it'll stop or something that's horseshit Michael osterholm set of straight on that that's nonsense and I can handle it he develop an immunity when you catch it and for many people this is going to be like a bad cold for many peoples going to be like you're coughing and your end you just you just try to get better stay home drink a lot of fluids be healthy do your best and eat healthy and then get out and you're going to have an immunity to it and that's going what's going to happen on the other end I saw one guy he had it and it was fairly mild and then they quarantine and he got over it is getting over it and getting better and then they quarantined him with a bunch of also had it and he got it even worse probably wasn't fully developed yeah and then it just overwhelmed his immune system cuz he's basically quarantine with a bunch of other people that were really really sick but he got through it he was talking about it and all these poor people that are stuck on boats oh my God it's crazy this is going to kill a cruise ship industry there's nobody there it's actually kind of nice I only ask and stuff but I'm just like f*** it what are we going to do by closing down buffets all-you-can-eat is f****** pig out but that's also how they do it on a lot of cruise ships have buffets only one-on-one cruise ship and by the end I wanted to throw up like oh my god look cuz the first day you like the food is amazing but it's so buttery gross and it's like being stuck on an apartment building filled with drunks but you're all on the roof and if you jump off the side you're definitely dead yes but tasty food it's like being stuck on an apartment building filled with drunks but you're all on the roof and if you jump off the side you're definitely dead yes and they're feeding you the fattiest grosses but tasty food</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> Carmack at a bar in Texas which was fuckingawesome and it's funny because he started telling me like well if you guys going to make it you know we were in production on Doom Eternal he's like if you guys can make a doom game here's what we thought we may doom and everything you listed we're all like that's what we think Legacy to live up to yeah it's the pits a really special place to work at the tremendous amount of I do want to say pressure but we're all motivated spot that's just they they they they are able to get away with things at a lot of mainstream AAA games struggle with because of how violent is I mean they are like again it it's it's Evil Dead 3 with a Transformers budget like who the f*** gets to make that like you know like we get you see we spent that shitload of time making that stuff like in a lot of situations I've been in a Craftsman you know working on the entrails later this looks pretty good and well and literally the notes you like I need the pentesting the kind of like flap a little when you get the thing off you know like how do you know if you cross the line is there a is there ever been a time when you had a scene and people are dial that back we we actually totally you know what you say hi to you start the project it's it's kind of like there's a fair amount of brainstorming in the strength of any creative team is the biz at least four game is how you brainstorm with each other at the Cinergy in that room has to be good you got to be selfless you got to show up you got to be willing to support other ideas other people's ideas we have f****** amazing group in that regard but totally we try to establish that the like look guys we're not making Saul we're not making hostel it's not malicious it's not meant to make you cringe and we actually got together a little video of like what we thought violence wise was inappropriate and totally felt off and then we made another video of what we felt right and that was Evil Dead 2 with like it's not a slow trickle of blood out of a sliced open wrist it is some dudes head came off and Hawaiian Punch to start Spa and shooting out of his head you know like that's really what it is like it it's cartoonish you know how it goes so far that you because the thing is you do this so much so often you are murdering demons per minute like I don't know what it is but it's fun crazy if it was off-putting and realistic and kind of like who you'd be so turned off it be sick like you did make you sick after a while but so kind of weird that would make you less sick well it was more realistic and less bloody I'll for sure I mean it's totally we could we could twist that where every one of those is mean-spirited and really off-putting for for sure I mean I don't want you to sell me some PR stuff to sort of defend your game against people that are anti-violence what you're doing is super bloody and disgusting and vile to say that somehow another that is less off-putting than less gory is it's a ridiculous argument I don't use any here or anywhere else it's Joseph it is not this is no PR this is so like this so you look at saw you look at torture p*** horror movies there they're cutting Achilles tendon f****** exacto knife and the dude is screaming in pain and he's a person like this is gnarly s*** he doesn't look like he's having a good time like verses on Evil Dead 2 when you wipe off the head of that one Grandma creature that comes up out of the basement and like f****** Buckets of Blood start coming out red people believe that because look Your Design Story is going to be exposed to the to the consumer into 10 seconds like they can see through your b******* in 5 seconds if they like dude you're trying to sell no like so we have to have an honest good design story that we can stand behind that is true and that that is the truth I mean we basically looked at like cartoons and like make it over the top be animation so every time he was a perfect example every time you murder a cacodemon which of those flying balls you pull out their eyeball kaco OCA Co you literally here like out I can't do it sound and that is absolutely intentional to take the edge off what you're doing because if it was more gruesome and they're like it's The Exorcist vs. Evil Dead 2 those are two completely different movie Sino house house was the movie that came out in the 80s that was inspired by Evil Dead that's like a f******, timid is a comedy and and it's a horror comedy versus The Exorcist which is f****** amazing f****** amazing but really very serious you know and that's that's how we're able to do what we do they stop selling it look like if you had a demon s*** that's what would look like like oh no tearing you up on the way out what is an original one that is the original cacodemon from the original Doom yes oh cool so it's an updated version of that but you know just more graphically intense yes</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> that's my hope for the future is it games are like that and you're actually able to exercise doing that because I think that if you had a game where your in a warehouse and you're actually running for your life again you know and demons are chasing you and shooting down things like your heart rate would be jacked you could do that for an hour and get a sick workout in and have an amazing good time that would be awesome great shape running from demons you would I wouldn't have to get up so early in the morning play this game but you can play this game in a warehouse where you know you have all of the boxes and all those stairs therealreal stairs and real box yeah you're running around this pre-designed map and you're actually engaging with his VR demons with a haptic feedback so f****** Glory killing them half repair parts write Jamie David new rides today for I guess Out Here Disneyland the new Marvel campus is going to be in somehow they're tracking your hands so during the ride you shoot things for points weekly daily and monthly stuff psyche and your family could get dragged me along our the best at this ride going on with the games whether your mouse and keyboard or controller though it would be hard to achieve in VR I think VR offers like a very specific unique and f****** amazing experience and I would I would just like separate the two like you know when when and when we're making VR games we're definitely trying to do something else which is cool in and of itself in and of itself but there's like not just in our game but in a lot of games like there's just Resource Management there's likes the high level 2 skill medicine happening I mean you know you play so like you know that that's hard to reproduce in VR in certain ways at least at this time but it but I think that's the thing where people want to take how you feel or how a movie and gauges you and apply it to a I think it's like Let It game be it's on your blood game be a game but a movie be a movie what VR be its own f****** experience like that looks fuckingawesome but if we just so so I would love to kill waiting a platter and beyond our I mean seriously especially somewhere like Texas where there's a bunch of warehouses like oh yeah where you can get three or four of them and set them up for different maps in the game Debbie f****** off a laser sight on your rifle and you it is it's it's it's a lame arm I can do anything he wants but he's doing I now like he's not doing VR anymore I heard I heard he was Consulting with oculus but now he's he's pursuing a i he likes a challenge he's a very interesting got to talk to you I really enjoyed talking to him yeah he is awesome you really think about what he's accomplished in the world of video games mean he's the Mack Daddy amazing games that's the guy you guys like keep your eye open for like where VR is headed and things like that and go will not yet or not ready for that yet but one day down the road we'll have something kind of a different again like we're like it's sort of like with cars I went to school for automotive design and because I love video games you know the training in automotive design big clay models about that big there their they're f****** amazing and and really really amazing place did you know that the design process that you learn their you can apply to kind of anything anything but a lot of things certainly video game for sure cuz it's just kind of questions you're asking which is like how do you start from nothing to something you know like that involves large groups of people then you can learn that there I forgot your original but I know it's like you know so I use a lot of car now she's at the office quite a bit and and it's kind of like we make a race car and and if VR is something else that's like an SUV that's like just another kind of car so like we kind of perfected how to make race cars and is been doing it since the 90s so like Doom Eternal is just another race car. accessible to Consumers I'm wondering you know where video games are headed I'm wondering if you if you think that's where they're headed everything is always going to be a place for them on an actual video game I can get an actual computer rather than the actual video game I think the the that's where my focus is other people like Carmack are looking to see where will not anymore but we're video games were going to go next but I am fully focused on where they are now and how to make what they are I think the the that's where my focus is other people like our Mac are looking to see where will not anymore but where video games were going to go next but I am fully focused on where they are now and how to make what they are now better</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> anyone contacted you before this or sense in particular and asked for your advice as to how they can better prepare like the president and and that's right yeah and so you know I I've never had a partisan. I'm just a private in the public health all right and so I actually service assignments Envoy for this Administration in the state department last year you know if still in my full-time job at the University until I've never been I mean I'm there to give the best advice I can see and do you think there's anything that you could do now that could help them make sure that we don't have these shortages of masks and shortages of medicine and IV bags and something that could be done to you obviously you've laid out all these problems and you laid it out in your book here to pick about right now go pick it up on Amazon right there an audio version of it as well I have no I don't know I don't read myself now there's actually a really good voice not mine I work at 110% time but if they were trying to fill all the orders they've gotten just in the last few weeks would take him years and years with the capacity they have in you can't build build these new machines to make mask overnight so this is something that should be set in advance of anything like this any pandemic happening like long Advance we should be prepared we look at what all do we need we don't do that in public health we've tried and so you know what stockpiling 500 million of these in 95 would have been the difference between night and day and when you look at the price of one of those VS1 airplane not even close if you look at the things like that it's like these medication at or think about our defense department employees are at risk of running when we can start now but we're not going to fix it now is to say what are the key things that we should do vaccines you know if we had been serious about this we might very well had a coronavirus vaccine work specifically for this train will it work for SARS and MERS but right after Stars happened in 2003 everybody was hot and then when the interest rate is it something like the flu where you know sometimes when they come up with the flu vaccine it doesn't necessarily address the current strain it could be and that's where a coronavirus family vaccine may not match up right here now but it could end in the flu and you've really had an important Point there's one where you know we do have in it in perfect vaccine but it still does a lot of good you know if 50% of people protect that text lot better than zero if we had a vaccine right now I can't wait until the crisis to fix these things you know what we spend about .0001 percent of Public Health compared to our defense department and yet look how vulnerable is the bugs is not a war is not a missile is bringing down the world economy right now virus and that's what I lay on a whole plan in here like these vaccines like to stockpile some ass you know we should have a plan in place already what we going to do with our schools when they close are we going to really close calls let's not try to make this on the Fly and I just mentioned if we closed schools we are going to really hurt some people this is a wake-up call cuz you're nobody I think really believe that I got to take you know the market today cuz you know on this particular day crashed badly and you know I think that up till ten days ago the market didn't even think this was a possibility they just be if you look at it with flying high on Friday I did a briefing for over 400 major Financial investors around the world and you know I am Halifax and make sure people understand it the questions I got from these people almost remind me of a six-year-old who's afraid to have to go through on a dark dark hallway and I thought friends and colleagues Friday night through this we know where we going to go with it no plans again is caught Everybody by surprise I mean you were the one of the few people that wanted to deal with this issue you don't we set this up several weeks ago you know and I think that's where the country hasn't seen it caught by surprise</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> China because they have this incredibly large population 2 billion they've got this food supply that is largely Wildlife that comes into these markets weathers is incredible contact between people in these animals and the crowded nature of that society mean I think one of the things that surprised who in Wuhan city of 15 million the entire metropolitan area of 60 million and so you have crowded so closely together that if you add in the bugs coming from these animals and then the potential for this kind of of contact word spreads quickly has been a vessel for a long time that's again why we have to protect ourselves here because massive number like these kind of cities these wet wet markets so that's what it is a lot of I remember one day buy my own half wild big mean in these titles every animal imaginal to humans and I swear to God they were some of the movies I think that were in there and they're all just right on top of each other and I actually have a picture that I show him some of my lectures there was a situation with all these chickens in a cage 15 or 20 getting a flu viruses if you wanted to create the perfect experiment that no no University you do research group and let you do is you put birds and ferrets like that together and so together as a ferret to put down some markers on what they're going to do to supervise these markets have to eat but I think this is a dangerous practice where we see it but you know what happens to look at Africa with ebola primary source of this outbreak in West Africa was so it went somewhere pretty big bats you know they're very literally 3 ft wingspan so they're big and so you know that's one of the challenges we have with with China we know that this was going to happen is going to occur we think of the flu viruses the same way and that's how we knew doing better flu vaccines usually beef flu pandemic the same thing hanging out and some of them are still alive and then they'll actually preparing for your right there they they basically kill him and got him and so forth to get some pictures up there's are there you go.

I would have been hurting that ramira but probably hurting yourself kicking it on me just Solid Rock is a solid imagine. And he didn't just a break-in hurt him affected. Uses length uses reach uses attributes down the outside use the he's a higher-level kickboxer use that you know and try to lure them into you know attacking encounter those those attacks but it's one of those things with ABC like when Tyron Woodley Wonderboy kind of same thing geologist are there let's just be in a really exciting but you lose if I'm going to have that sort of a special feature in your card right those hot those punch holes are valuable and you you let yourself get cracked when you didn't have to there's no need for that you should always fight smart it's dangerous enough do you let yourself get cracked when you didn't have to there's no need for that yeah you should always fight smart it's dangerous enough to fight smart hitting look at hit and I love that you know that's how I believe as well you know that's why it's just Styles it's just style the way Styles match up</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> when did you start training what year do start I started doing it for that you're not even 10 years knowing he's so I actually started MMA training as just a kid two cakes while offline bug lake so I was you know that was when I was 214 pounds so that's something that obviously when you when I'm farting and you say 240th and O what is exactly 6 on a good diet give me a good stretch at do some yoga sessions at 5:46 but you know what I mean it's just I wanted to stay fit in between ya and in between Luxor of the Season preseason so that's why I went and started and just loved it ever since that was about Guerrilla volume are you guys say it was size you so you were early early twenties and know martial arts training it all before that wrestled so I wrestled before I even done rug Blake arrested for about probably yeah I kind of remember was about a year and you know I'm pretty good actually pretty good at but you know what I play football with my mites and drive away in the tots United wrestling and stuff like that I was just something that yeah I end up just playing for the night so I sort of gave it up and I was actually pretty good at so we wanted to win the Nationals lucky Estates the wrestling is known as Big in Australia as it is over here but you know I still want to look around Championship twice and stuff like that to have a game tonight because that a PCYC Place Boys Club it's just a local Club usually don't have no games not tonight that wrestling day and I just went there one time and another tryna was just like Alicia coming into trying to go so I just thought of doing it and then I was actually pretty good again I was always the mother's room 12 person God wants us all to me and you know Tomatoes all that much older as well and I used to do well so that's why little people you have photos mad you know when I gave that up because I was doing so good and then the sign was about to be late when the play-by-play giving people photos mad giving that up as well because of something was pretty good as well so what made you decide to make a switch to MMA professionally football play of the match score for email try so you can imagine that guy running for teemagers was just so I was trying it and having couple of thoughts while I was playing rugby league pretty full-on solo happening you know I guess that's probably where I get some My Fitness today as well you know I mean up just always been a bit of a game and then I'll just it's just something I've always done but maybe from back in the days as well but I really do I look in American football mike I think rugby safer I don't think it's safe it's obviously a very rough combat sport be a lot of limits kind of a cop it's kind of like a team combat sport but you were at least not under the illusion that you're protected like American football players have been for so long with the helmets in the pads and that's what's causing a lot of the brain trauma don't run in a tepee no no no helmet as well but I get what you're saying I actually think that you know I think you're right I think it down there I think they they considered this but people are so accustomed to football helmets football pad so the idea is to just make better helmets and better pads but according to the guys who really study traumatic brain injury that's not going to help because it's the impact of the had the brains washing around inside your skull that is just so the amount of mass that you have these guys colliding into each other almost unavoidable actually when you talk in person and that is willing to love people you know obviously wake up the smaller clubs within the boxes that they have more padding but it's just so many more strikes to the head and they recognize actually and I can imagine is and then also there's nothing else you can't even louder it goes to the ground you can hang on you could try to submit someone you try to wrestle with them there's not a lot of options inboxing you know I definitely so what so you you did well in rugby and you had a couple of fights while you're playing right what was it was it just a one-on-one aspect of it like what made you decide to focus entirely on that. And I love the fact that you know you're in there by yourself you know I've always been so you can play the time of your life in USA Rugby leg and still lose where you can do everything right in a Nike thousands of meters whatever it is and if I am Papas and you knowing the gym you going to say that Comfort on and I'll go no one else to blame but myself so you know that's all boys love that and again I just always love martial arts boxing UFC even before I even started in a training MMA Outlook and listen to music and all that unites picture myself in the world to AutoZone can you can watch whatever time you want and the pipe of you was at Publix inside a butt in the pipe with you was on and I remember watching Chuck Liddell Tito Ortiz and Ken Shamrock that was the first time they first thought so the first time I ever thought about you in like UFC and that's when I just absolutely stopped loving it's always been in there and all that and I wasn't even trying to talk he doesn't mean that there's a lot of them are sure there's some pussies over there to cut their men you know what I mean like this like one of the ways people look at Australia it's like it makes sense yet great combat sport athletes who come out of Australia Gonna Fly to know what soda stop but when I was younger that that would happen and I saw the boys they known to fight and being able to flattop a thing of voice at this year so to defend myself and I want to start it but I have to finish it but it's just something that I guess I'm heading me so talented God you never got a lot of that very good athletes everyday but they're always in your rugby legs and I have fell or whatever it is now UFC and MMA is getting so big that you're wigging these athletes starting in a training tonight and you're only going to say it grow even more when we going to get a little more Champions coming out for me original they're good athletes everyday but they're always in your rugby legs and I have fell or whatever it is now UFC and MMA is getting so big that you're wigging these athletes.

		<div class="paragraph"> well what else can people do in terms of all this hand sanitizer Jazz and masks is that all right thing for stopping a lot of infectious diseases they actually are really good they're good for your hands do you know in terms of the skin they kill the bed bugs but the whole issue of using your hands touching your face be transmitted that way so I wouldn't tell you to stop using hand sanitizers but don't think it's going to have a big impact on this f*** you see that viral video that's going around that woman who is giving the address at the best of the White House and she she date she tells people not to touch their face and then immediately licks her finger and I did sausage and you know the data we have on this is so sparse to say that that's the case I think the primary thing about hand washing is is legitimate but one of the things people want to do something they want to be able to like they're doing something and so we tell him wash your hands often in 2% this to prevent this disease and I feel like we're not being really honest with the people can you stop this disease which there's two kinds terms of the air coming in on the side they're not they're not effective at all so people wearing they look like they're doing something or not now if you are sick they may help a little bit from you transmitting because if you cough then you cough right into that cloth and the other one that was called an n95 respirator but drawing I'm just saying that that's how I look at it all the time and helped her all the time and they use me about 90% of my using industry so when they're grinding things are asbestos osetra another don't breathe in all these parts so if we have one of those battle to some Costco don't have the money to do that those Preppers right now are so excited yeah all the properties across the guy knew it I knew the day would come yet will they are they are and this is really important because how healthcare workers go is how the country I think we'll see we're going the other been over 4,000 healthcare workers in China who are infected mini of on their job and a number of died and if in this country we have a real challenge delivering healthcare because we roll and then we have healthcare workers picking up the infection like we talked about the group in Milan and we don't have the protection for them I really believe that's when the public will say wait a minute what's going on here and and that's where I think the challenge we have lived affect your healthcare workers they are the front line of people and end the biggest probably have a lot of these those people get infected the doctor and nurse working intensive care it's not like you just took out another Soldier you took out a special forces person you just can't bring somebody in from Family Practice forever and put them in there and so we've got to protect these workers and why I'm really concerned that that's one of the areas we not done nobody stockpiles we have no capacity to make lots of small the sudden you know prior to this event the hospital purchasing agent would go online workers and I'm really concerned that that's one of the areas we not done nobody stockpiles we have no capacity to make lots of money all the sudden you know prior to this event the hospital purchasing agent would go online click a button send me five thousand of these will be there the next morning</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you said when you sat down was absolutely perfect that the timing could not have been better tell everybody thank you I understand where they come from so we can make sure they don't happen in the first place but most of all trying to respond to situations just like this just like this and just out off the bat overblown or how do you stand on this first of all you have to understand the timing of it in the sense that is just beginning and so in terms of what hurt pain suffering death has happened so far is really just beginning this is going to unfold for months to come yet unless I think what people don't quite understand what we saw in China I'm convinced as are many of my colleagues as soon as they release all of these social distances is mandated stay and Holmes have Straumann weeks and weeks kind of thing when they go back to work there on Planes Trains and Subways buses crowded spaces manufacturing plants even try to come back again and so this really is acting like an influenza virus something that transmits very very easily through the are we now have data to show that you're infectious before you even get sick and in some cases and remind people that's just the beginning probably the best guess what we have right now on what limited data we have to say this going to be at least 10 to 15 times worse than the worst 10 to 15 X fatalities over 480,000 can occur over the next three to seven months with this situation so this is not one that to take lightly and I think that's what I can understand if you say 10-4 2450 desk just remember two weeks ago we are talking about almost no cases United States and now that we're testing for it and watching this bread he's like the second spread very quickly and it also can affect people I think maybe to put this into modern turn to this is something we think of often and we think of you know pre-antibiotic days you know the old time medicine we have an employee at our Center for infectious research and policy at the University Minnesota and she has a dear friend who lives in Milan Italy and she works at a hospital and she texted this to this employee of ours last night and this was an email that came out yesterday from one of their in Blount the largest hospital. He said I just got a very disturbing message from a cardiologist at one of them Milan's largest hospitals they're deciding who they have to let die they aren't screening the staff anymore because they need all hands on deck and have a very small areas of the hospital dedicated to non-coated Patient or they still screen doctors everybody else is dedicated to covid-19 so even if they're positive me if they're sick they don't invite they don't have a severe cough or fever and they have to work he says that they're seeing an alarming number of cases in the fortysomething range rage and is Holy hook horrible cases so we need to stop thinking that this is annoying Old person's disease but this is what I'm going to unfold not just a move on some folding Moline is unfolding here and Seattle and this is what's going to continue to Rolling Lee unfold throughout the world rumor come from that it's an old person's disease people that have died from it so far been older yes in fact that's the primary risk factor for Dyna Speedo old and then having certain underlying health problems for example in China those men over the age of 70 who also smoked ate 10% of them died 65% of older Chinese men smoke the case fatality rate the challenge we have is it that's the Chinese data but there are series of risk factors that we worry about that if they overlay on this disease are going to cause bad outcomes and we happen to be right at Ground Zero for one of the major ones here in this country has obesity we know that obesity is just like smoking in terms of its ability to really cause severe life-threatening disease and 45% of our population today over the age of 45 in this country are obese or severely obese we have is we're going to see more of these but I would guess I would call very serious and life-threatening cases occur in our country because of a different set of risk factors and we saw in China you mentioned that there's some sort of an incubation period before people become sick they're still contagious what is incubation. And how do we know about it when we call something an incubation. Talk about from the time you and I got exposed I was in a room somebody else who was infected with the virus was expelling out I breathed it in how long from that time. Tell the time. That you get sick and what is that is that we called incubation. So that's when case numbers can double or triple and every so many days in this case is about four days so and we actually have data there from people who are exposed one time for one time only and we know when they were exposed were there were exposed how soon do they get sick afterwards so the chauffeur in the car with an individual is sick showing symptoms than the show forgets it 4 days later they were there one time and one time only the chauffeur does not show any symptoms he's still contagious because he's okay this is what's unfolding here and in this is what I think is such an important and I said why the timing is so important cuz you know Joey really got to get information off the public there's so much mess around for information right now and you know we're going to be this for a while this is not going to happen overnight I worry I keep telling people were handling this like it's a Corona blizzard you know two or three days and 6 months or more that are going to be like this and you know so far this thing turn on folding exactly as we predicted it we on our Center put out a piece on January 20th and said this is going to spread worldwide have time people said I was just trying to be put out a piece the first week of February said this is going to pop probably the last week of February first week of March is what happens if it has what's called are not or a doubling time of these every four days do to increase is doubling every 4 days so if you go from 2 to 4 to 8 to 16 it takes a while to build up that's what we're seeing happening places like Italy we're beginning to see it in some ways up in Seattle with what happened in China and you know when people are confronted with that suddenly this low-risk phenomena there were talks about isn't solo anymore and that's we need to prepare people for now what can be done like what what can the average person do I see people walking around with masks on wearing gloves is that nonsense largely first of all ocean is just a restaurant just breathing in studies in Germany which just have been published literally in the last 24 hours they actually followed a group of people who have been exposed to so many automobile manufacturing plant and then they had nine people that with this exposure he said if you have any symptoms virus they did blood they did stool they did he earn any found it at that very moment when they first got sick they had in Crowley high levels of virus sometimes ten thousand times that we saw was SARS in their throat mean they were infectious at that point already they hadn't even had symptoms yet over and and that's where we're concerned because then vaccine we don't have a vaccine here so what's happening is people in public spaces are getting infected and the way you need to address that is unfortunately if you're older over 55 you have some underlying health problems which unfortunately allowed Americans do we have obesity then right now you don't want to be in large public spaces what we eat we can close schools one of the big challenges we have right now if we closed schools what we accomplished and influenza virus when we closed schools that kids are in school really good news features of this disease China only 2.1% of the cases were angry 19 years of age and you know we don't completely know because I still get infected with the virus but they don't get sick I get sick and the kids do symptoms are going to test against are all positive so some diseases will manifest my primary when your adult but not as a child this one appears to be the same so do we close schools or not if we're not really spreading the disease because it turns out that if we closed schools with a recent study done showed that 38% of nurses today in this country who are working in the medical area have kids to school and suddenly 1/4 of the population has no sick leave if we closed schools they don't get paid if they have to stay home so when you ask what can we do we have to really be thoughtful about what we do are we doing more harm than good by closing schools for example if nobody else I hope we got to do everything we can or do we just tell people you know it's going to be a limiting your contact as much as you can and that's really about what we can do and limiting the contact is that really going to help do not transmit as much if I'm if I'm sitting in a room with a hundred people and what kind of sharing are the Transmissions remarkable right here the off the coast of California you get your cruise ship cruise ships for recirculating air inside the inner cabins we've had a number of outbreaks that's why I'm having these outbreaks quarantines of some kind of a want and follow up on him but you're guaranteed they're all going to keep getting infected day after day it seems like we're not really prepared for something with this although the CDC has been telling us for a long time that we should be you know we are not prepared at all things to come you know what a flu pandemic would look like if it emerged in China and if you read it it's exactly what's happened to supply chains went down trying to lock down the country it spread to other countries people have pointed fingers and you know it's it's the kind of thing where we hear in here but we don't get prepared you know five years ago I gave a talk at the Mayo Clinic a picture of a building Puerto Rico nondescript building and I said this is our next big disaster turns out that 85% of all the world's production of IV bags with sailing we need desperately we're made in these plants in Puerto Rico and all we needed was one one Category 5 hurricane Maria this is a wake-up call the business Community I hopefully will wake up you know what are the other things were doing right now this is really one of the things that has been most concerned about this whole situation is our group has been studying for the last year-and-a-half with support from the Walton Family Foundation looking at it turns out that we identified that people need right now are they died on the crash cart all of them basically are made offshore the United States and large part mermaid in China and India and at this point we have shortages anyway everyday but just before this prices happened now they Supply chains have gone down our group is actively helping United States government try to figure out anybody else they are beholding in China for these drugs 690000 Americans have end-stage renal disease right now most of their private. You're coming from China and now with the shutdown that was happening with us and this is what I talked about in the book why I'm so concerned because we are at risk situation it's about what the entire system is rigged up to be and what does virus does once it gets into it does once it gets into it Jesus you make me nervous before we get done here to talk about what we can do to get people not nervous because this it's too late</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> the average person that is sitting around reading these articles that say don't worry or readings aren't these articles that say this is the end of humanity what would what could these people do like what what could they do and what do they do if they get infected or first of all and and let me just give you an example because we've heard a lot about Wells going to go away with the coronavirus with the seasons okay when it warms up it'll go away well you know the other coronavirus have that we've had to worry about was SARS which appeared in 2003 in China and when that came out illness in the name really Crash and Burn and many of them died but what we did was basically by knowing that identify these cases in their contacts quickly and so they had symptoms brought them in put them in these isolation rooms they wouldn't infect anybody else and it took until June to bring out of your control that had nothing to do with the seasons which is another Coronavirus by the way sorry it was palm civets and we the type of animal food the roads that we got out of the markets are in the Arabian Peninsula we're not going to use that 1.7 camels and there it's a hundred and ten degrees out in this virus is transmitted find thank you I mean it goes from animals to people that goes in the hospital's there's no evidence that seasonal there because there's a model for it and what will it be because how does a how does something like stars run through a population then stop being around anymore we had good Public Health had we had the same kind of transmission where you're highly infectious illness and you knew that you are in trouble and then you could isolate you and we didn't understand virus transmitted so that's why I stopped because we don't get rid of the camel switch keeps hitting humans day after day but then when I go to the hospital we no longer allow those individuals to transmit to others in the hospital cuz we do what we called good infection control soon as they get there during special rooms with special mass and all this kind of thing buddy saying about seasonal flu year you know we're going to stop this one if you don't have vaccine that works you don't it's just breathing that's all it is so what's the best-case scenario here come with us and so we don't quite know what it's going to do yet I think you know we've been right on the mark predicting where it's going to be today I think from here on out I can tell you it's going to stay around for months is not going to go away tomorrow we got to stop thinking about if we just get through tomorrow that's it so we're going to prepare to do that rods in the reaction I should say and then it stopped by itself but also because if your if two of the three of us in this room room you in right now to protection because natural protection that I couldn't transmit to anybody so that's what's going to happen if you had enough people get infected all family then slow down stop transmission that way but that's a heck of a price to pay to get there flu or something that's really ruthlessly deadly 1% of people who died and grandkids mostly older or younger people that's one out of a thousand with this one right now in China were seeing between 2 and 3% of the people die in summer this is okay but on the other hand we have a lot of different people in countries like ours that have even more risk factors for having that outcomes in China and so Spanish Flu 1918 that was about a 3 to 3.2% case fatality right now it did preferentially impact 18 to 25 year old brainstorm which is an antibody response in your body that's out of control and it basically you destroy yourself and it sets this thing up to trigger off so the healthier people have the more adverse reaction to exactly the part of that immune system that woman says this is not all me get rid of this like a rejection of a graft and the other part saying it's the most precious cargo / carry you know I got to make sure I don't lose it and when that virus got in between those two it started again that same kind of cytokine storm now the thing that concerns us about this fortress on in in 1989 really bad flu year at .1% and it could be as high up here you know getting closer 2-19-18 like and that's the numbers I just gave you a few minutes ago from the American Hospital Association of funeral 480,000 us here in this country over the next 6 to 12 months</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> earlier about probiotics is there a benefit of probiotics once you've taken antibiotics to refurbish your gut Flora you know that's where the study is really at this point have demonstrated that it's very temporary in other words if you're taking probiotics you can get a boost initially but it doesn't sustain itself over time in the natural Flora comes back but what I'm saying is is it beneficial to people if they do take a probiotic after antibiotics does antibiotics do have a devastating effect on your floor is it beneficial for people once they have taken an antibiotic to take probiotics with rotary flourish at least temporary support that they don't stay around what if you just keep taking it they just don't stay around your normal gut Flora will come back and take over so the probiotics and of themselves are not giving you that long-term boost so you don't think there's any benefit to having even even short-term boost now there's one exception to that where I would say this is a very different thing than probiotics but we actually have a disease called Clostridium difficile which is bad bacteria that happens when you take too many antibiotics and it's colonizers your gut cuz you don't have competing organisms there and then you can die from this there are treatments for that called actually fecal transplants drinking poop purified purified bugs from the poopy right but you take that and that's what that's that kinda is what you're talkin about that does have real benefit and there is clear evidence that if you take those those people transplants as opposed to just probiotics with such that that can have a major positive impact on your recovery from things like classroom difficile infection and so more more institutions now actually are doing which you never thought that that would be but are those who've had problem there their life saving there maybe we should change the name that would get you don't forget it if you that's what's going to be nerve-wracking to people I've never really done much better much better</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I seek the advice of experts whenever possible and what what I was seeing was that there was a lot of weird misinformation and I could conflicting information lot of people saying don't worry in a lot of people that were terrified I'm like okay I got to talk to an expert and lucky you were willing to sit down with us and help us out hope you tell him the stuff they're going to panic can I say what what's Panic if you see anybody ride in the streets yet have you seen cars turned over smash you seen people hurting themselves over this issue if they're concerned they want legitimate information and so what you need to do is just tell him the truth and we have many experiences like that a few years ago thousand people were in so we had a big town meeting several thousand people showed up and I addressed them and gave me everything I knew about meningitis were going to do about it a cetera and then towards the end of the flock I said I just need to let you know about one out of every seven cases of this dies and then they got on with dealing with it we vaccinated the whole town 20,000 people affection one weekend for this bacterial meningitis but it was because they had faith enough cuz we told him the truth and we said what we know and we didn't know so that's what we need to do here then you just have straight talk don't tell him it's low-risk hurricane that's when you do today is just say this is going to be challenging and we're going to get through it. We are going to get through it I hope this wakes people up to the value of vaccines to there's so many wackos out there that think that vaccines are you know us scam or they're dangerous or if it's there so many people out there that won't vaccinate their children I couldn't agree with you more I think that's really important point that the you know we got to get this idea these vaccines can be life-saving if we had one right now think how different the situation being wearing right now it would be radically different. You see that the measles making a comeback and vaccines we are just finally bring into a closed this outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo far Northeast part of the Congo 20-something 2800 people have died from this okay been going on for almost 2 years totally preventable mean I think that's why I have to say thank you for what you do say about vaccines cuz people listen to you and we need every positive ways cuz we have so many crazy voices out there right now that are seated arm medical innovation in in human culture and that's vaccines it's amazing what is done have there been adverse effect effects on people course everything everything that people do there's some people are going to react in a bad way it doesn't mean it's not a positive thing and there's a reason why the cases of polio or so tiny is a reason why smallpox went away it's because of vaccines text Nate until we get enough people not vaccinated and then look what happened there's a famous photo of two twins from the early Twentieth Century one of them has smallpox and one of them was vaccinated have you seen that I have I have skin all over his bodies faces hands and then his brother right next to him with nothing and you know what's really important to note here is that in that body all those things are very painful but what's going on inside the body is equally bad and so don't get diseases of terrifying they're really terrifying and went something like this can be prevented and the reason why people don't do it is because they're avoid vaccines and they get that information from some wacko website or some person who really has no business talking about it you know whether it's the people out there that the think that causes diseases or that the government plot or that it's a medical scam because just trying to raise raise money it's just all of it all of it very very disturbing but it's part of people you know that human beings for whatever reason there's a percentage of us that lean towards conspi toriel thinking and did the lean towards thinking that there's some sort of a plot against them or the government's against them it's just got to listen to Medical experts the chapter on coronavirus is the title is SARS and MERS a harbinger of things to come I mean we don't we should be funding these things almost like we pay for our fire department if we had to go out and buy a fire truck</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> ask about Lyme disease Lyme disease is a scary one right then. I mean so many of my friends in East Coast have it it's really terrifying that that did that part of the country in particular seems to be like really badly infected with these these texts that would carry this disease what can people do to prevent that and what what can weed has no vaccine for Lyme disease and I know there wasn't one point but people were having an issue with a good friend of mine actually got Lyme disease from the vaccine before they discontinued it what can someone do to sort of protect themselves United States named after Lyme Connecticut it's a disease that actually probably originated in the Upper Midwest and I tell you that because it turns out that there is a focus in northern Wisconsin and and East Central Minnesota where there's Lyme disease is a disease called anaplasmosis a human deer kind of component and back in the CCC of the 1930s the whitetail deer population had been virtually totally depopulated from the Northeast and so they actually trapped here in northern Wisconsin and took them out and deposit them in the New York and Connecticut and so forth and most of those deer are actually deer that you know today Hillsdale College in my knowledge of Davis we're up in northern Wisconsin that has Jerry come into the check station and they would actually measure the number of ticks are attached to the nape of the neck and they had a lot of things wrong and they asked Hunters who are driving back to Madison and Milwaukee if they would be willing to check in at the station down there for just a second and then they're going to count the kicks again and it turned out that as the vehicle come rolling down from Highway 51 from northern Wisconsin get on the interstate 90-94 and go to Milwaukee or Madison but it's just kept falling off that this Lyme disease issue is a key 1 Lyme disease is really important disease it's real no question about the challenge we have is that there's a lot of people that assume that they have chronic lyme infection and you're the data on that is just really really not there to support that these people are chronically infected but they do have an immune response it again for the bacterial infection it's a fact that this bought at your bone body's immune systems we've talked about several times today I starts attacking you so I think it's a summer picture with chronic fatigue syndrome same kind of thing these people really are sick they really do have problems but it's not something you can treat someone people I have a challenge because when people take IV antibiotics that extended periods of time for Lyme disease had what we call a double-blind control placebo-controlled trial where half got the drug half got a IV but no drug and it turned out all four of these studies in Lyme disease the people who got the gist of placebo did just the same as the people got the truck and I worry that were using antibiotics a lot there in this is where I just mentioned earlier about claustrum difficile died from the IV treatment for what was chronic lyme disease helpful and so we need a lot more research in this area to figure out what are these people getting what is it that we can shut off so that they don't have this chronic lyme disease picture knowing that it's not actually just you have to treat him or treatment so I can help him with the antibiotics anymore and so I think that that's an area that we just need a lot more working and numbers are growing as you know game systems really cranked up immune system is playing something bacteria but if we treat you is that like it's like every other picture you can really get rid of it but I used to have this chronic illness that's occurring and what I think is hard is that we see people who have those who are desperate to have somebody understand what they have and they end up going to people who take advantage of a clinician to charge them an arm and a leg for things that are not going to help them and drugs can we used to it reverses immune system disorder I am a friend of mine who's a UFC fighter Jim Miller and he's he's got Lyme disease and it's pretty bad he takes a stack of pills I don't know what he takes every day what do you think someone is taking and what what benefit would they get from that I couldn't help but I'm not without knowing what it's there but again it's not that the bacteria still growing like it might be for a lot of people in autoimmune it's autoimmune that which is real you know that this is another thing you'll find interesting Minnesota prior to the arrival the first Whiteman the Native Americans burnt March 1st 8 all the time the Prairies for much of the territory even in northern Wisconsin Northern Minnesota we had the classic you know Pine Forest firewood White's room and so much of the forest that the you have a very different kind of mammals population d r a cetera et cetera and with the suppression of fire what's happened is we now have instead of having these old growth for us we have all those younger you know Nann Pine or any kind of like the old trees of the Upper Midwest Elms in the maples and everything else comes in in the Buckthorn all that kind of stuff and takes over so so what's happening is in in our state of Minnesota is we have a really good example of this is we're losing her moose and the big primary reason is brain worm the North in Minnesota and where that intersection is we're starting to see moose develop his brain worm infection cuz it's from the deer so the tick population has changed to due to the fire lack of fire in many places in the Northeast never used to be like it was with her all the time that would clear out natural everything so so one of the challenges we have with Texas is there here we're not going to change how we live suburbs and trees and all of that controlled Burns eliminate a lot of them ironically the Moocher population is expanded dramatically Isle Royal why because there's no deer out there and so they're not getting brain worm out there so people have said you know the we're going to lose our mood as well as well as the deer so so fire actually has helped the most in areas in northern Minnesota where there's been a lot of fire the Moose populations growing because the deer or not there because exactly those mammals or rodents and so forth are very different and burnt-out areas and they are in will they do controlled Burns in some states I got a lot of friends hunting in Washington state a couple years ago and he said it was really weird because there's these massive fires in the distance that were actually being controlled they do it on purpose which is a lot better than having the out-of-control fires where you have so much fuel problem with the east coast is you're dealing with a lot of these sort of almost residential area that it had all these ticks for Lyme disease for us we need is there any kind of an animal not enough now they're they're doing very well thank you text do very well as you know so heavy in in certain times of the year at the really literally takes a lot of blood happens day after day so that is a hit on it's a real hit on them to pull up the picture that took a freak people out there to watch online just didn't need to see this it means it's not affecting me until someone in your family has it UFC fighter Marcus Davis who he put He had his wife got Lyme disease and he spent hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to trying to help burn in do something about and treatments and all these different things for it it's it's a challenge and this is another area again you know when you think of the amount of money we lose in just lost time let alone pain and suffering now this is the kind of infectious diseases really need to Renaissance I mean when we do a lot of the United States where they showed the areas that are affected by these 6 + what what percentage of ticks carry Lyme disease they've tested and some places in the Northeast Us in the 60 for sale you still there they're very real coyotes in Central Park they do absolutely in the Bronx they have them in it makes weird it's weird to see because this is something that just didn't exist before and how these coyotes have that all over the poor dears when they got rid of the wolves and they try to do the same to the coyote they just actually expanded their territory and they're sneaky very clever little animals adaption just like microbes coyotes. How when they got rid of the wolves and they try to do the same to the coyote they just actually expanded their territory and their sneaky very clever little animals adaption there's like microbes adaption</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> did I ever tell you the story about my friend Phil Hartman when he was a kid he was a roadie for Jimi Hendrix for one night he was like what it whatever you would call it a grip someone who's on the road a stage text and and and he's there putting his hands on speakers making sure they don't fall over because they were kind of seriously close to the edge and away from me I could have touched them Hendrix Phil Hartman told me with great with me and Phil Hartman got high a couple times when we did lose radio together it wasn't wasn't much he got high he got high a lot I matter fact I might not have even gotten I definitely a drunk anyway he was telling me about when he was a teenager that he worked with Jimi Hendrix he was at the whiskey when he was a teenager Jimmy died in the late 70s right I think that was 24 years later that make sense if he was like 19 is a time or some like that wow so anyway he's a kid and Hendricks is right in front of him and his job is to make sure the speaker doesn't fall into the crowd and he's looking up at the stage Santa in his prime and I went out when everything is going down you couldn't believe it was real you couldn't believe you stand right in front of you exist before Hendrix Hendrix and everything else is like what you read about Eric Clapton quotes about seeing Hendrick play for the very first time it's fascinating cuz you realize like the top of the food chain guitarist go to see Hendricks and then Phil said it was happening right in front of me fill in a wood dabbling music for funny really enjoyed like playing guitar f****** around do for him to be a kid and be standing right in front of Hendrick performing was like wow that's a new one right dog whistles only been around for like 2 years has people calling something a transphobia homophobic our sex is dog-whistle like holy s*** like you can't say anything anymore I was on the internet very early 1987 before the world wide web and you may remember we had something called you snap group yes and you snap groups and the way used to work because we didn't really have a widely spread internet back then accepted universities now is on MTV and when I saw the unit like holyfuck I'm emailing with kids my audience who are not counted in the ratings by the way College audience don't count in the Nielsen ratings released didn't at the time and they want something very different from what MTV playing so I was like wow this is interesting cuz I got into these Usenet groups in the way that worked if you post something and then overnight it will be copied all around the internet and how to connect with special server when you pulled into groups that you had subscribed to and so really it was kind of a it wasn't immediate conversation we post something and then people would reply back and I just kind of jumped into feet and immediately f*** you commercial what's the quote like that you supposed to go to the bottom and the top and I'm like well what's going on and what that was is the minute you have the opportunity for people to say stuff anonymously they turn into giant dick bags almost everybody this is just an easier way to do it now we made it so easy and with all the little the and I think I'm big Louis have swollen because of this and then you get this you respond differently to what you think is an attack in the attack Reddit and you know this shouldn't have registered in your brain is it something really dangerous to go back on them but they're not and that's the that's the best thing than the blue checkmark became a little more interesting which I don't have and I tried to get one for a long time and they somewhere over there hates me and now really I've never gotten a blue checkmark I don't want one now now to me it's the mark of the beast you got a blue checkmark you know I'd be looking over my shoulder man is like so now that's become kind of those those the people that now risk being deplatformed because you have status until it's going to bang against these people like the f*** this guy so it's some human nature that is just exist within us know if you really easier for me to go online and under whatever Twitter handle had Joe rubbing you dick wouldn't say that to your face looks to be the fuc up some know both my parents converted from Judaism to Catholicism where they met each other that's what I'm getting to is during the during the second world war they were both in New York first generation American Jews they converted for different reasons from each other and then they met my father's family was Orthodox and his father and him shepsle deubner would come here when he was in his maybe late 20s from Poland he still lived as everyday in Brooklyn as if you were still in Poland you didn't change at all when my father converted and his father found out my father was in the war he was overseas he was home on leave and his father was cleaning up in from my father's pants that he left over chair rosary beads slipped out and fell on the floor that's how his Jewish father ships will do when you're found out that his son had become a Catholic so what he did is he proceeded to sit Shiva for him the Jewish mourning ritual or for 7 days you mourn the dead he he declare that he would never again speak to his son and he forbade everyone in his family speaking to his son so I owe the time I was born I was the youngest of eight kids in this family because they become very Catholic I didn't know this whole family of my father's was unknown to me entirely so they did exactly what you're saying now did the same thing but it was less dramatic cuz her family was less religious so they still did take it all that she'd converted but you got any children yeah I got a couple again though it's alongside my first of the first book ever with long before Freakonomics with called turbulent Souls although it got been republished under different title called Choosing My Religion and it tells us the story of my my two parents around me are children so no chance but but on the other hand maybe this is what Freakonomics is what I try to learn through doing Freakonomics is you know to measure the what and try to figure out the why but then not be the judge who says that was terrible this is wonderful because you know different people I have to look if she absolutely were here we can ask him what's your side of the story he could tell us a story that might convince us that you know what this son of his did a terrible thing to the family did a terrible thing you know he would say how could it be that we Jews existed for generations and generations and generations when everyone lived there was always someone trying to you know get rid of us and then we finally come to America you know the land of Freedom religious freedom economically and Hereafter generations and generations of forefathers fought to stay Jewish hear my son decided to become Catholic what are you thinking so you know everybody's everybody's got a perspective everybody's got an emotional experience so I try to respect that but no I would not do that to my children that their pool with a pulling it back with fishing wire to keep it up on his head that just seems he seems oddly stiff you know I'm saying yeah like it seems like everything is pulled Victor certain amount of laxity in a man's face when he reaches a certain age particular around the forehead area I'm just not seeing it I'm not seeing any movement either which makes me wonder about that like I want to see expressions in your forehead My worry is his lack he has a very big that he lacks the ability to have like a cohesive story but he's not good at being bunch of little black kids be like in the black kids will come up and they see my hair go up and Bubbles come up his brain is it he's losing a lot of I tweeted something this morning cuz there was someone put a video of models on the runway on a catwalk and they're all tripping and falling at the same spot these dumb she was there and I was like this is Biden's brain cells it's like they think you're on the right path of the they get there are now and then and then he called his wife isn't everything you know that you know I forget what it was ever forget with The Gap was but it was one of those we listen to me like what your what do you say it like it's it's like he has no brakes I want to have a different take on it cuz I listen to I said all I know what he's doing when do you think it is from the bottom on the second he doesn't want to hear it what's the old man who can't talk like this is not a joke like that right now you know nothing play that again 2 into a mental hospital they should be like Hey Joe you are right he had three Strokes while he was saying that the first one what does that word dude self-evident is that we hold these truths to be self-evident yeah dude either drunk or you can't talk me it will just choose your bezel evident he shouldn't be doing this and then and then he says when he goes he could have just said all men and women are created equal and gotten out of there been like f*** it and said he goes being like f*** it looks instead he goes I think he didn't want to see the Creator because there's a lot of the religious thing what are you trying to say you believe in evolution or not are you a science denier Joe Biden the science denier</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> are you saying from your perspective saying like he he was a martial artist right so then isn't that still true without the movie should he was a phenomenal martial artist was definitely phenomena martial arts you can compete really compete well yeah I guess that's part of it but I mean like can you not compete and still be the top of a thing I mean is that possible I don't know man you know that's the one thing that if I was going to make an argument against me as a commentator for the MMA for MMA identify like it's kind of hilarious commentator for MMA you know I'm a fan of it I know mostly what I'm talking about I have it it's really interesting Cruise or work with Daniel Cormier can you call me in particular so I can of the best wrestlers to ever compete in MMA an active wrestling coach coaching two and Lara MMA coaching two but both guys are so good at breaking down the Tactical it makes you realize how little you really know about certain Specialties you know what is a good at what you did at the differences are they good at also articulating emotion and Publix the public of viewpoint that the difference I can give expert analysis of ground fighting ground fighting I can do the expert but just you know not to blow my horn but I know what's going on like the way a lot of people know what's going on with boxing I can tell you what's going on with chokes and when friends in trouble when someone's not and I could see it because I've been strangled a million times so I can't see that most MMA fighters at a certain point in time they know most basic s*** in terms of positions and when things are dangerous is. Gets exotic like weird rubber guard transitions or strange chokes like people invent new chokes all-time Zoe's like something new that you haven't seen before I caught a f*** that he do that and I have to go come watch it again but your people think how many people think that you did fight and I don't know how many a lot probably. I don't know I had two in one and kickboxing I lost my last kickboxing fight but as far as taekwondo I have no idea I won the Massachusetts state championship 4 years in a row and I want and I think it's called the American open which is a big turn when I came in second place in the u.s. cup that was a big thing in that was in Connecticut and I fought the national champion in the finals and I thought I'd beat him that was when I was like 1920 that was when I was at my best when I was around 21 before I try down for the Nationals and try was going to try to make the Olympic team that's what I was starting to box and kick box and I was losing faith in Taekwondo I was realizing that there was I had a distorted perception of what I could do so just wait for you and you were way more engage with boxing than you ever were with like it up yeah that's what it was I would go to these kickboxing gyms and when I would just bought when I kickbox guys I could kick them so hard they couldn't get close enough to box me a lot of time so I'd kick him in the arms I kick them and they be like what the f*** and then I could even though my hands weren't as good as those my legs were so much better cuz why these guys couldn't take it all so long as we're starting at a distance I could my legs into them and they just be terrified like so many guys just be worth who's trying not to get hurt and you can't kick this is a terrible feeling someone to see if someone in a fist fight I'm done I'm getting this pain in your arm like motherfuker it sucks dude but when I was boxing with you I was getting lit up and particular there's just one dude there's a box with his name was dangerous Dana rosenblatt and wound up to become the Massachusetts or the New England middleweight champion really good guy and I was sparring with him a lot in the beginning he was beating my ass and I was like damn this kid wants to fight way more than I do cuz I was already doing, the time and I'm starting to realize like I got to pick one of the other and then as I was getting into boxing this when I got into, right after my twenty-first birthday and so when I was getting into a trike really into kickboxing was like 20 into 21 and the same time I was thinking about doing stand-up and the same time as realizing Taekwondo is bulshit not not really bulshit but not for you and it's incomplete right to protect yourself you don't know where the punches are coming from me and you get used to it only way to get used to his to learn how to actually box and I didn't know how to actually box until I was like 1920 when I started going to these other gems and then when I when I realized I had these giant holes trying out for Taekwondo like doing Taekwondo tournaments and I still competed in Taekwondo but last I wasn't excited about it anymore cuz I realize like this is if I want to be a complete martial artist like I want to follow like Bruce Lee's teaching I found a hole in my game search it up there's a whole part that I thought I knew how to do and I didn't I got a punch things like I can post things hard but you think that's boxing until someone pops with a double jab left hook up to like boring to you too cuz I still wasn't the best in the country and I'd lost in the finals to the guy who is this Kareem Jabbar think his name was sounds good he was good I lost a lot of fights but there was ones that I won that I didn't get the decision of what a point system forget the side I never understood but I love boxing watching my whole life and things don't get I still don't get boxing scoring when you're like one where do they come up with these numbers just people that aren't good at it you know if you had like a boxing judge just like that's what I used to love about a county judges Letterman to tell you what the score was who tell you what the score was like so he would say this is how I have it play I wasn't bored with it in that I achieved the highest of heights it was that I realized it had holes in it like big holes huh big hole dig holes in a street fight with one of those boxers and I was in a bar where I couldn't throw a kick out of being deep s*** yeah deep s*** and side learn how to box but that was right still like Mike Spirit like I'm no expert that's my point like I'm not a guy who should be explaining like everything is going on but it's entertaining all these NFL guys are mad cuz Tony Romo got a 17 million dollar contract and they're way better than him on the field than he ever was on the eleven guys are getting paid way lesson this dude was the f*** is this dude getting paid as talking that's what makes Guys Like Me on Sanders he he does have and this is something that you would share his Acumen for the game is so strong but his also like his onions are so real that he's not trying to save a job a lot of times these announcers they strategist save a job you don't like doing the right thing me and say he doesn't give a f*** he'll call out an offense or defense and say well this is why they f***** up that last play and I think America goes oh s*** that's great that's cool to know versus someone just going here's a play-in there's a plan that would happen next better than anybody has he played The Game Genie just came off the field, and he's great DC DC, and yet Donna Cruz Paul Felder who's great attitude and all these guys that have fought before especially at the the really highest level maybe even fought some of the guys are doing commentary for they give real inside as two things that God does what they train for Tennessee's now he's great DC DC, thing yet. Chris Paul Felder who's great attitude and all these guys that have fought before especially at the the really high as level maybe even fought some of the guys are doing commentary for they give real inside as two things that God does what they train for tendencies</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I wonder if if you want alot the inside of your knees gets accustomed to it like I get to calus in there will know like it strengthens is that possible cartilage look it up baby cartilage is gone out of those ultramarathons how they do it year after year after year cuz it would have canceled their whole life you do for a chunk of time to your niece your schedule if you if you just a b**** you keep going if pushed through Wendy's window fixing himself legs just break and no usually likes Calas over once I can there's a campaign for a great cyclist called shut up legs if you look up shut up legs it's like a whole thing about his people worry about running ruins knees but a new study finds activity main fact benefits of joint changing the biomechanical environment inside the knee in ways they could help keep that could keep it works moot working smoothly made arthritis come on Ronnie may be good for your niece that's the New York Times you dummy You Don't Know Jack schitt epidemiological studies of long-term Runner show that they made that they generally are less likely to develop osteoarthritis in the knees and people the same age who do not run sometimes scientists speculate that running running may protect knees because his often associated with relatively low body mass caring less weight is known to reduce the risk of knee arthritis there's no evidence and proof they're just saying this is a possibility the widespread argument generally Falls the lines at running will slowly wear away the cartilage that cushions the bones in the joints and causes fries for this little evidence supports the idea that makes sense okay okay so what I was saying I was incorrect I was just tried to jump paragraphs I miss the context of it you would think they didn't these volunteer stop stop go back these volunteers visited Clinic where they have blood drawn from an arm to researchers also siphoned off a small amount of synovial fluid a lubricating fluid that reduces friction inside joints when the right knee healthy knees contain only ones that were soup console speculative to there's nothing to research supporting it to channel knows well it makes sense though that your muscles would be stronger and then that would probably support uni better than a person who doesn't exercise that cartilage wears out either way anybody you know that's a great athlete that was said that I need to meet cartilage and we're through so much like jumping a lot like cutting exploding I left you know I can move that you would you want to court you know and then if you're running on a trail or it's got some dirt get a little cushion in the other something other some George in there this is a 2017 this one is more updated off of a new myth toppling new study that says that middle-aged Runners do actually rebuild the health of their knees what did I tell you I had an idea what is the question again with the scroll up could it be that marathon training and racing are actually good for Arnie's maybe a new study you son-of-a-b**** Runner suggest the answer is a qualified yes the study finds that taking up distance running rebuild the health of certain essential components of middle-aged knees even if the joint stops off somewhat tattered and worn when I tell you b**** show me the results also contain a caution John mileage Cooter Road one vulnerable area within the needs the study finds if one is not careful focus on running activity harms needs to do scroll down the question is that the end of it so you're giving me s*** about I wouldn't know you wouldn't do it either I would do a half either I'm not doing it I don't wanna run with all the people very specific spot it says the Improvement to the damage subchondral bone of the tibial and femoral condyle lies make I know that they do microfractures and s*** like they do all kinds of different things to people to try to heal the cartilage in the knees right now I just realize how privileged running is that was like I just got to run sometimes during the day yeah just so you don't get so fat from eating all the food you want that's crazy all of our problem in America is eating too much food yet and we have way too much access its were spoiled with it but I just realized I got to go I can run to the gym and I'm home and that's a good nice day I get to have nice lucky dude man no I wouldn't you know I wouldn't run a marathon because I don't like the people that do that's genuinely at you see all the people that get accepted the thing the culture I don't want to be a part of it no thanks play music for hours before an actual Marathon plan things miserable if you had a track or go standard University track this is how how how many feet is that like was that quarter mile what's most are you paying me and Jamie but it seems like that would be a great bet if he's ultramarathon Runners ruined put their money where their mouth is the get-together on track see how long ago or s*** * 404 quarter of a mile that means four of them four of them are a mile so if you'd be pretty close to a hundred how you get to run a hundred four times to run a mile time to run a marathon on a track laps Yeah a hundred Laps on a track but now you're closing in on Marathon around around a hundred times it 100 four times as it is a marathon no way no f****** haven't you hit 7

		<div class="paragraph"> really bad stoppage this past weekend in the UFC really bad really bad I could so much controversy huh but this one was a bad one was the worst stoppage I've ever seen there was this guy who will pull up the you can find it in the UFC's I got to remember how to say this guy's name what he claimed he stopped the fight don't need to I was hurt and he wasn't hurt he was faking it okay so the Michael Medved Enclave she's think that's how you say it and I forget I say kudo Bella's first name of things to Aeon I think it's aeon coulibaly on soku Bell was playing possum if you watch the video you can see the video it looks like he's playing possum so he's pretending he's hurt see he got hit for sure but look how is his head back and forth he's Sakura man for that right hand right trying to pretend that he's hurt and then so that right hand the referee stops the fight while he's throwing her yeah yeah yeah he's like I'm fine what the f*** are you doing that's not a guy who's rocked if you watch it again you can see that he definitely is getting hit but you can also see that like when he like that this that's fake that that's wobbly with the head because you seem like Haymakers and trying to lower the guy into thinking that he's so her that he can't control himself in these trying to throw Haymakers please also definitely getting hit too so I can see how the referee fell for it but you got to let guys fight you got to let guys fight and sometimes referees in the interest of the fighter trying to save a guy from damaged they step in and they make a mistake that's an easy mistake to make cuz it is a really bad stoppage but because the fact that he was faking like he was hurt but he wasn't faking like he was hurt enough to stop a fight now it didn't look like it back with big wild Haymakers he can win any time has been many many fights where you see a guy win a fight is getting dominated because he catches go get overzealous and turn right and that's what we got robbed up referee f***** up or the you know the referee booked up but he also was a little bit tricked by this guy trying to lower this guy in by pretending and then exploding he didn't even if the guy was really that rocked it wasn't enough stop the fight that guy was throwing back he was defending himself it was moving back with his hands up and turn and fight you don't defy just doesn't end when someone gets hit or ignore the fight and you can't protect yourself anymore defenseless yeah Ace is trying to soccer this guy and I mean maybe he's got this thing that he does and he rocketed sounds like he's hurt I don't know where could have Bella's from is that rough going to die number if he's rushing at Randstad yeah the only that's the other thing other sports have many refs you're the only one dude and you're on edge and Shih Tzus when I stop another referees to go ocean I do.

		<div class="paragraph"> did Fox News is designed for old people on Loop in my data on Loop in the living room so many old people want to go over their house there watching Fox Box new men over 60 is mandatory I can't believe these lips I can't believe them Fox News may start getting really having to pop culture that's when it makes me laugh when they stare like did you see what Ariana Grande was doing the other day and like nothing to talk about a ton of s*** oh yeah give me the presidential candidates that have been on Fox News like I think Yang I know Bernie's been on Fox News and I think Tulsi definitely been on Fox News as well yeah and people just get real mad at them whatever. Buckeye bottoms are too I just wonder about his skin that they're pulled a pulling a back with fishing wire to keep it up up on his head this just seems he seems oddly stiff you don't saying yeah like it seems like everything is pulled like there's not a I expect a certain amount of laxity in a man's face when he reaches a certain age particular around the forehead area I'm not seeing any movement either which makes me wonder about that like I want to see expressions in your forehead My worry is his lack he has a very big his he lacks the ability to have like a cohesive story his brain is an easy losing a lot of I tweeted something this morning cuz I was at someone put a video of the models on the runway on a catwalk and they're all tripping and falling at the same spot these dumb shoes there and I was like this is Biden's brain cells it's like they think I'm on the right path of that I get to know did you see the thing that he was talking about God creating women or no and then what do you say it like it's it's like he has no breaks his car is not going on the Hills I got a actually I like that more already want to say to me but do you know that you know that you can't be president. We can't play any games here folks this is a really old man who can't talk like this is not a joke like that right now you know the thing play that again this should get you into a mental hospital they should be like Hey Joe you are right do you know that you know he had three Strokes while he was saying that the first one what does that word dude self-evident is that we hold these truths to be self-evident yeah I'm right here again doesn't do it equal and gotten out of there been like f*** it looked and said he goes he didn't want to see the Creator because there's a lot of the religious thing are you a science denier Joe Biden a science denier that's it but that's part of the problem with all these my biggest beef with anybody in the Democratic party when he watches debate is they all want to say the thing that they really feel but they're tiptoeing cuz scared of the f****** minds someone going Warren Jeffs at T and she's not DC's anti-trans because you refer to their waiting for them to f****** while they're making people behave the way they would like them to be right there they're forcing compliance right another f****** minds someone going Warren Jeffs Etsy and she's not DC's anti-trans because you referred to as they did their waiting for them to f****** while they're making people behave the way they would like them to be a life they're forcing compliance right</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I think you'll love the story the illness Amazon trip I told you about we land in this airstrip when is playing when we get into this Village and I'm like cool about today to hear it took the bus 5 days we're going to head upriver and are like translators like you can't do that yet what do you mean you have to have the shamans blessing to go upriver and I'm like okay what does that means I come to the Moloko which is the spiritual house spiritual house and we talked and we talk him to go but just like almost like idle conversation where he's almost like interviewing us it will what are you doing where you going where you from any other really understand any of this right he's like living in this community long story short he goes okay you can go but you have to take the blessing and we're like sure whatever you need for us to go so he pulls out the snail shell I can show you a picture of it the snail shell with a monkey bone in the top and a tube worm to close it and in the snail shells with green powder and he's like this is what you for the blessing so he goes around the circle and threw a monkey bone pipe he blows this green stuff in your nose not know that word that we heard I couldn't tell the name of the pipe no no the stuff they blow up your nose is it ddmt it it's coca leaf and tobacco I'm like all together and around the circle and he hit three guys and my brain feels like yes or gets really close to get this long tubular Monkeybone piping and it just blows it up in your nose and hit three of my guys and I'm watching a little bit nervous cuz like I'm very like standoffish on drugs I got I know things affect me very strangely anyway hit in the nose all of a sudden I feel like I've got acid on my brain like chlorine in my head I break into the sweat eyes explode and I'm like wobbling like this and it's 30 seconds later I'm just crawled over in the fetal position just projectile vomiting cannot hold it together and Lorenzo this the tribal Shaman goes good good and we're likewise as good and he's like he had a bad spirit in him if he had gone up the river he would have been killed he's just got the bad Spirit out this is why I had to bless you now you can go and I was the only one that hit like that are five person everybody else my brains or whatever I was literally fetal position feverish puking crate and I've never done any drugs like hard drugs like it's just not my my thing and this thing just hit me like a ton of bricks after he said that did you think it was there a scientist you're very smart guy but was there a part of you that was like mad it's just got right yes that's what's so crazy here I am nobody else f*** affected I'm sitting in the fetal position puking my brains out in the guys going good now you'll be safe and the whole f****** trip I've got that in the back of my mind going maybe the whole reason nothing's going wrong it's cuz I just had green f****** powder blowed up my nose super weird and nothing is ever affected me like that I mean curled up puking shivering when you trying to make logical sense out of this we try it when we like was was there ever a thought we like maybe in this extreme environment that's so utterly different than any other place in the world that these rules are different absolutely I'm sitting there going going into it I'm like cool yeah I'll do the stupid powder if it means I can go on my Expedition you know I mean like I'm not like embracing it I'm just like going through the motion to get my job done as a scientist and then I had this experience and I'm not saying I was enlightened or awoken or anything like that but all of a sudden I attributed my success and my safety in small part to the green f****** powder blown up my nose by a shaman through a monkey bump in the thing about it is even if that's not true if you think it's true and then you wind up being okay and you have confidence that you're going to be okay and maybe you have less anxiety and make better critical decisions because you think that everything's going to work out exactly exactly totally cuz I was super focused on my mission we were very very successful in what we set out to do and I feel like because I had that crazy experience and cures this old little jungle Indian going now you're now you're going to be okay I didn't have any anxiety going into the situation and before that I had no thought of it ever playing a part of the placebo effect right that's real effect by believing it something works right but is there a fee for a change in the way interface with reality if you believe that you've experienced some sort of spiritual in richening and then some sort of the some bad spirit is been released from your body is that possible I think so I think it changes your own reality because of your perception of the outside world that is a freaky thing for a scientist to say I am a hardcore I've never considered spirituality religion anything and I had this this crazy experience that is like Change My Mind Set On on crazy jungle medicine and drugs and catching animals at everything because this one got blue crap out my nose and I puked everywhere you want to experiment with other plant medicines the only reason I did that is because it was a necessity to do what I was doing it was coming from an expert if you will but a person who saw it as a necessity to do what I was doing and I was under his guidance to go out is because it was a necessity to do what I was doing it was coming from an expert if you will but a person who saw it as a necessity to do what I was doing and I was under his guidance to go out and you know pick a mushroom and try it and having experience is I don't I don't see the benefit in that but when someone who lives in that Community Embraces that wild jungle said this is my home in this is how you do it I will absolutely do it so you do it like out of respect absolutely</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you were doing this like you've been involved with so this is like the family business sort of my family business is my mom's business actually it was Safari businesses so like like you say sit in the Land Rover see the animals kind of thing and they did a little bit of Taurus walking safaris but then I grew up on a farm on the outskirts of Harare Zimbabwe and then whenever I wasn't in school I was on the farm run around Barefoot catching snakes fishing yada yada and then when my mom wasn't booked up she had this little Bush playing the cheese for safaris and weed Adventure all over Africa sounds great I mean it's like one of those things where it's what you're used to write on moving to the states at age 14 and like trying to find my place in the world be in this weird little private school kid from Africa way more terrifying than going to meet a tribe in the middle of the Bush for sure I go to school pull my part of sitting in my uniform sewing to a very proper English boarding school pull out my pocket knife start cutting my Apple 15 minutes later I'm in handcuffs then like what did I do what did I do I literally had no idea what I've done wrong because I had a knife at school everybody I'd ever been to school without a knife to cut their apple like it was the standard thing so here I am with like police and guns and badges and they're throwing me in handcuffs and taking me out of the school on day one in America and I'm like this is the scariest thing I've ever seen and I didn't even learn until later that day that it was cuz out of pocket knife at no point do I think having a pocket knife is a bad thing so they didn't tell you know they just grab me there was like this whole thing like the knife went flying I was chained up another what's going on what's going on in big trouble and it's everyday my whole life and now I'm like when you think back about that do you think that's just the consequences of being in a law population for sure I mean like we like it was nothing like that but then you come here where you know the stabbings and stuff like that and it's because you know we had to do you think that it's possible that there's no way you could live like that over here and there's no way you can have kids with a bunch of knives nobody talk to you about it before you left the house she's from Africa or things so you were doing these always doing is walking so far as you started out doing the driving ones and then eventually you start doing the walking ones far as well which is why I have so many Hippo &amp; Croc stories cuz we'd be canoeing down the Zambezi River and then taking photographs and seeing Wildlife that way what a crazy way to grow up man relationship to wild life is so different than the average person in this country for sure I feel like I have like regardless of being a scientist by trade I feel like I have a very intimate understanding animals cuz I grew up completely surrounded by them now what other countries have you explored I'm over sixty countries now or for biology contract before I did the show or just because like for instance when I got done with college I was like I had a little tiny little business during college sold it to travel the world and try and photograph these animals and I went to 28 countries looking for wildlife</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> do you want to get done sorry let me ask you a slightly different question or text me totally different as I'm sure you know if you look at any indicator of like Prosperity longevity health literacy access to food Etc humankind is way better off and it's ever been without an average there still a lot of people with a lot of trouble there still Parts the world that are still in bad shape so I was trying to get an amazing amazing Direction why are we unhappy I don't think we know how to manage our life correctly in life doesn't come with a guidebook it doesn't come with when you're in this condition seek out these remedies start exercising get together with your friends tell them you love them meet up and have dinner and hug each other sleep well sleep well drink water you know there's also you know so many of us have a bad head start like you're starting off you know like how about your dad he been growing up getting kicked out of the family I mean and then starts a family of his own will you don't even know your grandfather made its Madness right Madness so you're coming out of this stressful pocket or maybe your dad goes to jail or maybe your your mom dies when you're young all these things that happen to people where they have this bad start right and then they develop defense mechanisms to deal with all their insecurities and they get around similar minded people and Euchre the world and fuckeverybody fuc the police and f***** of this and then you get in these communities of people that think the same way and then maybe there's gangs and maybe there's drugs and maybe there's crime and despair and sadness in any because negative people maybe there's none of it but maybe there's no dangerous just f****** annoying everyday people complaining about s*** and you're stuck in the mud of humanity with people it's real hard to engineer 350 million people out of that but for yourself you can take Act make your life better and if everybody did that if everybody took actions to make their life a happier experience by doing those things by exercising eating well hugging friends and enhancing Community everybody pretty much and they all sound attractive so why hard for so many people to do it because people are lazy and the reason why we're lazy is because it's very difficult for us to waste resources on something that we don't currently do and even though we know something to be true that if you do this Ronica long-term benefits because it used to be a very rare thing to achieve I so if you could pick one thing let's say let's say I'm aware senior why would I pick one thing I feel like you know what society says everything is great I'm unhappy exponentially okay why is exercise the one did you get your blood pumping release natural endorphins and you legitimately feel better and I also think of the by think about this all the time I think of your body as almost like the energy and your body is like a battery and it requires a certain amount of use and when you don't use it it overflows and then you get weird behavior and overreacting to things and you almost like it and see if you got to get up and move I find what do you do with let's say you have to take too long flights that say you're unable to exercise for like you know 24-36 hours fine you don't have no I mean you you didn't do nothing you don't develop regular habits I can prove you're sleeping it may be accountable like 7-8 hours every week 4 and 5 or sleep well sleep with earplugs and eye mask anything like that don't have a problem sleeping kind of sleep well really need to know you're not a napper know I don't know I just never enjoy it really yeah you never tried it doesn't work when I'm done I'm done do you drink caffeine yes have you ever tried the caffeine nap you know about that are shut down shut down there's a balance there's a balance between being productive and being happy right and I think it's hard to find that balance because we look at like the the numbers that come in with his money or productivity or you know the number of things you've been able to create and you think of that as being like but look I can get so much done but if you maybe got less of those numbers but more of the numbers in terms of the amount of sleep you got you would enjoy the whole overall experience more I worry that I think for a lot of people who were successful in different Realms could be Sports business entertainment whatever successes intoxicating and then you want more of it right and then it becomes very easy to see that as the main goal at the expense of loved ones other people I'm looking for I'd like to know how incredibly generous and spirit to people around them but I find that you are a kind of its success often is driven by sort of ambition that's a little bit unseemly and I'd like to know how to deal with that a little bit better but it seems like it would be if it's a number game right if the success meeting like you're in a business you're trying to sell the most placards or the whatever whatever it is you know you have this thing in your head and like you're really driven I just say puresalem placards you already starting behind it's in you you have this goal in your mind being number one and you're obsessed and you know when everyone's going to tell your story told Bob he wouldn't let it go but every time I got there it was in the office and he left after everybody but look now Bob's got a f****** yacht and he's also got a pacemaker right Bob's ready to take over any minute now but also I think the thing is in pursuit of success I think would often happens that I've seen in people I know and then people I don't know but I've read about is that your moral compass starts to shift a year true there's a lot of people that are successful and we're only talking about business right when I'm talking about I'm thinking of some people in Academia who you know even though the average person may not consider the stakes in Academia super high but like if you get in a big university department and you start to write papers and get published and then get grants and accolades and so on your on a trajectory that's very intoxicating and then all of a sudden I think it's it's more I think it's tempting or not even tempting I don't think it's even a conscious decision you start to make decisions that are not as sound not as morally acceptable as you would have made 5 years ago when you were starting out and I don't like I see that happening a lot I see it in media I see people cutting Corners I see it in business I don't think it's even a conscious decision you start to make decisions that are not as sound not as morally acceptable as you would have made 5 years ago when you were starting out and I don't like I see that happening a lot I see it in media I see people cutting Corners I see it in business</div>

Suicide which is if you live in an environment where let's say you've got a spouse that's cruel to you or you got a terrible work situation where you live somewhere with a government is repressive whatever you can always kind of see a light at the end of the tunnel and you can say that you know when that problem is done my life will get better but if you live in a society like ours where you've never had to worry about having enough to eat you've never gone too cold or too hot where you're surrounded by prosperity and you look around and everybody else in like they're not depressed and you think what is it it's me the no one left to blame Theory and that's one argument for why there's like right now is a lot of teen and young people suicide in a country like America where the riches are the prosperity is boundless love your red Jonathan hates work so his take on that is that these kids are experiencing social media and they're experiencing this addiction to the internet and this cruelty that they experienced that the bullying the meanness the coldness and that when it started in on people and when they're losing their position in the social chain and they feel left out they don't have the tools to cope with that they're developing minds and this is the reason why you're experiencing this uptick that's directly correlated to the invention of the iPhone and the eventual the invention of social media application to all sorts of correlations will you see the inventions of these particular things have changed everything and then you see the uptick trying to keep up with the Joneses and this this feeling that they're inadequate or judging themselves against girls that are you know supermodels that are photoshopped and they just feel inadequate I hear you on all that we have to be careful that correlations proving causation cuz it's really tough because I totally want it looks like they both travel together. Right on the other hand history is full of correlations it looked good you know we're talkin about polio vaccine earlier polio for reasons they're still not understood by the way cuz I never really figured out the disease that just figured out of vaccines I never figured out what caused the disease but it turns out that polio would always spike in the summer time so there are a lot of theories maybe to do with being outdoors so parents would keep their kids indoors maybe it had something swimming pools people keep him out of swimming pools but then there was one theory that what else happens in the summertime that doesn't happen in the winter time ice cream consumption so there was a theory for a while that all Wheels caused by ice cream on paper the correlation looks pretty good so I'm saying look internet and depression and suicide are little bit more complicated than ice cream and polio but it's hard to tease out effects for sure know you're right but it's also hard to ignore the effect of social media on people's seems people are addicted to phones people are addicted the license of reoccurrence it's also been engineered in order to attract the most eyeballs and the best turns out the best way to get you outraged I agree but again just to bang the same drum again and again where there's grill with you where there's cost you got to look at the benefits and this is what I hate about politicians is they'll talk about a policy that they like they ignore the cost they talked about the opponent's policy they ignore the benefits so with social media friend since I know a kid a boy who was a friend of the family who if you were born 30 years earlier and there were no way to connect with people other than in person or phone whatever he would had a very disconnected life yet he just had some issues with with doing that with kind of in person he was kind of you know Behavior that's a little bit on the Spectrum just would have been very difficult as it turns out because of the digital Revolution he was able to build a community that is unbelievably good are there downsides to these things absolutely but you know you got to look at the benefits do I do I do I do I do I think human beings are adapting to a new normal and The New Normal is constant connection with all the people around us all the time if we so choose to engage and Lead are free so choose a problem is when it becomes more invasive than that right now it's if we so choose to engage but we get to some point we're wearing something that I transmit stuff into our brain always someone's wearing us if you don't if you don't do it then you can't be a part of this Corporation because we're about succeeding in this is the best way to succeed is to connect yourself to the network to uptick your bandwidth so that you can keep up with us come on Steve what's up headband that are you a tree Mystic about the future and in a general way now and with so that you can keep up with those come on Steve what's up next thing you know you were in the f****** hemp the headband that are you are you optimistic about the future and a general way now</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> the house I bought to write my first book was unbelievably I was so fun I could focus for like 14 hours a day 16 hours a day writing but the reason I was able to focus so well was because of cigarettes hydrate for about 20 29 minutes total focus go outside smoke the nicotine we just reset all the focus was an unbelievable drug but it's a terrible delivery system I've heard someone recently say I recently heard reluctant Trump supporter say the same thing about Trump that a lot of the things he's doing policy-wise especially foreign policy or Economic Policy really they like it so they said he's like he's like a cigarette like the drug is good to delivery system is absolutely terrible but that this one instance where I stepped outside with my brother after this intense moment and we had a cigarette and a few years later the book have been published I was buying the house now and newly married and I know that you're supposed to buy life insurance and so I got this insurance broker and he knew my name is that I read your book I said that's that's great glad to hear and then we started to price out the insurance and he said you know what do you do are you smoker I said no not a smoker cuz I quit few years earlier and then he called me back and said you know I read your book where you stepped outside to have a cigarette with your brother all the sudden I got the smoking rate for life insurance so this message I would say is really serious for anybody even if you've been smoking for 2 years they say if you quit your lungs can actually recover greatly so worth it he quit and that's how he quit so the best science at the moment says that vaping is almost certainly much better than smoking because they don't know all the chemicals and all the damage potential damage of vaping may or may not do but they do know the damage is cigarette the combusted combustible cigarettes and all the chemicals there are demonstrably pretty bad that even though like you said we were told doctors do it this is the best we told the same thing about sugar sugar gives you a great boost and so on but again my take is if you want smoke go ahead but wait a minute live in a finite life or wait a minute let's see now we are talking about who pays right so this is it gets back to the externality saying if you smoke and I'm paying for your health insurance as a taxpayer don't I get to have to say it's very good question and how far we should we extend that cuz if you're fat should have to pay ring you keep eating why do you keep beating right okay if you if you don't sleep well and you prone to heart attacks someone supposed to pay you know there's there's so many variables are you guys rock arms or what if you fall and break your leg have to f****** pay for that there's a lot of variables you got to wonder about when you start breaking down how much how much assistance people get based on their life choices at the way to do that is to free free healthcare then there should probably be a premium or I should probably pay into a little fund that is a pool additionally right you you theoretically hard to regulate Behavior because again where do we draw the line it what about BMX riding what about people who do this and that there's a lot of things that people hate to do everything you do you have to pay for the parents have to pay about driving the car you know my bad then we got to measure the benefit to CrossFit right you're building up your body going to live longer well that's positive and you're also probably hanging out with lunatics like you were riding you know crazy vehicles right so I'm a driver but I think that CrossFit the benefit yeah as you're getting in shape so that balances itself out as long as you do it intelligently you're you're involved in athletics but should we reward people should they pay less so if someone does Yoga 3 days a week and we supposed to make them pay less I mean I think you get into some weird swampy area people start Juke the system the same way when you know people got paid for rats and let rats loose and then f****** kill them gross yeah but we're improving</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> tricky part I mean that's why I that's why I like economist's because Economist are ruthless bloodless they almost don't know what humans are but they're very good at measuring cost and benefits and that's what I feel that our kind of political social media discourse is missing people are all for the most part Advocates are activists they pick up Blaine and they stay in it and they want to pave over the rest of everybody's lanes and make it and it's not a good way to be now it's not you know that's another episode that I was listening to of yours recently about how hard is gay people change their mind on things and I forget who the expert was who was talking but it was a really interesting point that he had about the mind like it was a change your mind you don't really have a mind or the mind of the community and if you step outside the beliefs of the community they can be very bad for you in terms of like your personal connections with people and I really enjoyed that episode funny thanks it's a it's a paradox though cuz the way you just said it like if you are in your tribe then even though it can be healthier for you and for presumably many other people for you to change your mind at least think differently about things right you risk losing credibility or whatever sentence like now you've escaped our group you are you're you're an outsider to my father who can both my parents converted from Judaism to Catholicism where they met each other it was very unusual it's a long story I'll tell you if you really want to know but anyway I'll do the short when I'm getting to the end this was during the during the second world war they were both in New York both first generation American Jews that makes they converted different reasons from each other and then they met my father's family was Orthodox and his father and him shepsle deubner would come here when he was in his maybe late 20s from Poland he still lived as everyday in Brooklyn as if you were still in Poland you didn't change at all when my father converted and his father found out my father was in the war he was overseas he was home on leave and his father was cleaning up and from my father can City leftover chair rosary beads slipped out and fell on the floor that's how his Jewish father ships will do when your found out that his son to become a Catholic so what he did is he proceeded to sit Shiva for him the Jewish mourning ritual were for 7 days you mourn the dead he declare that he would never again speak to his son and he forbade everyone in his family from speaking to his son so I owe the time I was born out of the youngest of eight kids in this family because they become very Catholic I didn't know this whole family of my father's was unknown to me entirely so they did exactly what you're saying now did the same thing but it was less dramatic cuz her family was less religious so they still didn't like at all that she had converted but oh yeah I got a couple again though it's alongside my first of the first book ever with long before Freakonomics with called turbulent Souls although it got been republished under different title called Choosing My Religion and it tells us the story of my my two parents run me to your children so but you're so scary at scary but it is but on the other hand maybe this is what Freakonomics is what I try to learn through doing Freakonomics is you know to measure the what and try to figure out the why but then not be the judge who says that was terrible this is wonderful because you know different people have look if shepsle do me were here we can ask him what by the story he could tell us a story that might convince us that you know what this son of his did a terrible thing to the family did a terrible thing you know he would say how could it be that we Jews existed for generations and generations and generations when everyone lived there was always someone trying to you know get rid of us and then we finally come to America you know the land of Freedom religious freedom economic freedom and Hereafter generations and generations of forefathers fought to stay Jewish hear my son decide to become Catholic what are you thinking so you know everybody's everybody's got a perspective everybody's got an emotional experience so I try to respect that but no I would not do that to my children I understand the outrage I understand being upset but I can understand choosing that over your son and over the relationship you have reached the end of the story then when that Grandpa and my grandfather I never met it was a long time ago my father's father I was very young so I didn't know the story either that was why I wrote the first book was fighted try to figure out this all the stuff I'm telling you now none of this I knew until I was in my twenties when I was writing this book but when shepsle deubner was dying of cancer in the may be late 50s or so a nephew of his who my father used to be very close with and who looked a lot like my dad and this guy with maybe in his early twenties late teens when he walked into the hospital room Shep so you know on his deathbed really thought that that was my father and son my my my dad's name is Solomon he called him shleimah and he was he was calling out to him shleimah Shawarma as if he was you know happy happy to see him it wasn't him though and my father didn't go visit his own father dying in the hospital because he been forbidden to go anywhere near I'm looks this is my religion I've been long fascinated by religion and I think that again if you think about it the way that Economist think about things there are costs and their benefits complicated hardcore atheists where they don't see any value in it whatsoever even though people are that they're getting some sort of ethical value moral value in the way I always put it is like it's like a scaffolding to live your life by you can live within these can fines and it really kind of makes sense if you follow it Loosely that we're doing to try to for the benefit of community a real community that comes from meeting and Sunday with all those other or whatever day it is with your religion and you meet in a group of other people that are also in the community and you are basically are staying together that you should do good things and be good to people and treat each other the way God would want us to like all that has undeniable benefits and it also says differently is like you're deluding yourself like your points the atheist or hardcore make points about the Preposterous nature of a lot of religious text her on the money but it doesn't mean doesn't mean that it doesn't give people the benefit and that I couldn't even disagree with them continuing it cuz there's a lot of people that benefit greatly from religion someone wrote to Assaf loneliness episode came out and said how did you fail to write about this supposed epidemic of loneliness without addressing the huge decline in organized religion in America which I thought was a very good piece of criticism that would have been a good because you're right it's a community one other thing I would add to the list that you provided what it can give is humility right because you know if you have an image of some Superior being God do you do whatever you want to call it you kind of understand that one mortal is you know the world does not revolve around me the other thing I would say and look it it's hard for me to scientifically logically Embrace a lot of the arguments a lot of religions make a special about things like the afterlife right that said even to an atheist I would suggest one way to think about it is if someone does believe in those rewards Rhythm and economically terms were talking about them as incentives even if it's a placebo effect in other words if I if I'm encouraged to do to treat other people well on the on the chance that if I do so I have a reward in the Eternal reward hey that's not a bad reason to incentivize people to do well sounds like a nice justification for them psychic house has a drive-by at the neon sign to helping people giving people a sense with the future going to be like a bad reason to incentivize people to do well sounds like a nice justification for them psychic houses we drive by at the neon sign the helping people giving people a sense with the future going to be like it might be imagined if that's where the real psychics are those neon signs</div>

Write how do you feel about that I mean there's a Libertarian argument to say what do you talk about people can do whatever they want they can do drugs they can Eco bungee jumping bacon workout stock trading which is stressful you know can do you can do whatever you want so where do you lie on that well I think first of all there right and you are doing something is definitely going to harm you however I feel like if you want to do something that you enjoy doing that's going to take some time out of your life that's fine night anyway who the f*** am I to tell you can't do that right am I going to tell gymnastics calling the ball crosses in a lot of the sub-concussive drama just heading the ball causes a lot of C I know a lot of Youth leagues now we're starting to cut out heading which I think is probably pretty good idea going with that because we didn't even touch the surface of this I'm in favor of people doing what they want to do with their life if you choose to do something we likely are we going to take away race car driving because that's one of the scariest goddamn things a person to do not as much anymore 2000 Dale Earnhardt Jr on his body out anyone in depth about brain damage that he's gotten from multiple crashes he talked about the severe impact of the concussion he talked about the difficulty coming back into the different modalities a different medical treatment to these had to have I. Dale Earnhardt jr. this after his dad is gone right this guy talked like real extensively on this podcast about his personal struggle with brain damage that he's received from car accident scary way to make a living. Arguably more scary than fighting because there are guys like Mighty Mouse Demetrious Mighty Mouse Johnson is like this elite MMA fighter that barely gets touched there's guys like him they don't take any damage and then there's guys who are Elite NASCAR drivers who wind up me crazy collision and go sent through the air and they wind up in the hospital all f***** up the impact was the impact of Internet Cade just your brain rattling around inside your head f**** you up and we're letting people do that and I don't think we should I think we should let people do whatever they want if they want to do they want to take a tightrope walk across the Grand Canyon and film it on YouTube I can't I'm not the guy unless it's over private land for public land with there's a law against using it who are we to tell people they can't rock climb who are we to tell people they can't ski where do we draw the line where do you decide a person can you make a good argument I don't think there's a bad argument with what you're say it's saying that it's it. Causes damage to people you're right by the way I'm a I love the NFL I would cry if it went away on the other hand and I and I know a few NFL will now former NFL players one of whom stop playing in his 50-year way earlier than had to cuz he was worried about CTE but also he was getting a PhD in math from MIT at the same time while he had a plan yet an alternative but then there's another guy combination keys and you should have money or show John Urschel his name is Urschel Domonique Foxworth play for the Ravens but I've got to be friendly with them had a great money-making career because he kind of got his big contract in his whatever 4th 5th Year took out insurance on it then got her in there and really never played again so he banked enough money Daddy went and got an MBA from Harvard cuz he's a bright and interesting and ambitious guy he will never let his son play football like to hear these stories about the guys who done it who made a life you know out of it and it just really makes me think about your right everybody should have the right to do anything for their own livelihood or for their own excitement right on the other hand like if we had the Coliseum today per se like the modern version the Colosseum if we had the Coliseum purse a fighting the Tigers slaves getting thrown into fight the Tigers we don't like that like the line things are repugnant until they're not and it's hard to predict where that line is a lot of things that used to be not repugnant slavery fine the whole world if you had the ability to do it right and then go straight back to the Coliseum the same thing and whatever the cultural line is especially depending upon how many people died around us how much plague and murder and do you do it right and then go straight back to the Coliseum the same thing it's like we have a line and whatever the cultural line is especially depending upon how many people died around us how much plague in murder and how much you know how much you're dealing with war that line moves yeah yeah</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> as a person who performs it and also has an audience member when I'm an audience member and someone's killing I'm letting them think for me right I'm not even thinking I'm just letting them take me down and say it like Dave Attell Dave Attell was at the Improv the other night we work together and he was f****** amazing one of the best I've seen from him and he said always been amazing but he was on fire and we were all it was me and my friend Owen Smith and Tony Hinchcliffe we're sit in the back room and we we're watching Dave and we were in a trance we were just laughing we were letting him think for us you know I'm saying like he's doing all the thinking we're just on a little ride to Dave's taking us on this ride and as an audience member I recognize that there's a mass hypnosis there's nothing that happens when we all get into this mindset and if someone is like really well-crafted material like Dave Attell and they take you on that you let them you like me politician is speaking quick question for sure Trump has a lot of elements of stand-up comedy in his routines for sure 100% if you watch his most recent speech where he's making fun of Joe Biden saying a hundred fifty million people are killed with guns at the First Lady oci keep doing stand-up so someone took it and they made a video saying Donald Trump at the Apollo and so they put him doing this speech with audience reaction from people watching stand-up comedy and laughing at a laugh track over it and it seems real it seems like he's a comic what about Bernie Bernie has a powerful speaker but I don't think it's that funny funny thing every now and then when you talk about like going along for the ride like doing the thinking for you such an interesting idea bright is a trustworthy person people trust him they see him up there he's not polished right the thing about Bernie it's like when he's saying things so there's and theirs and theirs you know anybody either the different kind of Polish what do you mean look polished performer fill in the blanks loading up his weapon for the next line when he's going to throw and call crazy Hillary lock her up like a stand-up it's basically look he's doing stand-up that's my buying is so f***** he's so f***** cuz he can't talk right he has a really hard time talking he keeps screwing things up and it's a real bad horse to bet on cuz he's an older guy you're still a Bernie guy I'd love the guy I love what he represents who wants to do good for people that don't have much that's that's a sentiment there's a desert quality that I think helps us as a community as a community of the United States if we have this agreement hey let's see what we can do let's see what we can do to balance things out and take for the downtrodden for the people that are hurting concentrate on them and he's made that a huge priority of his life and always has and it to deny that like look what he's trying to do I don't know if he can get any of this s*** past I don't think anybody knows until he gets in there but the idea is were saying we want better for people who don't have much yet that's what he stands for and you can call it Democratic socialism but it's an idea the idea is like helping people just helping people helping people you don't even know waking the world a better place than the corollary what's the Trump idea and why did it succeed bunch of pussies out there trying to ban Free Speech bunch of pussies out there come on America's number one f*** you f*** yeah there's also he doesn't talk like a politician you know we talked about China you go to them listen motherfukers when they charge 25% every like it's way more entertaining ever lived and not even close he buries all of them and he drags him if his fight even Hillary's now talking differently about other people she said about Bernie nobody liked him you would have never said that before Donald Trump she would have never ordered those word his victory over her is deep in her DNA now she starting to exhibit some of his patterns aliens millions of people who say nobody like him or nobody liked him in the second course course people like him and then they started running I like Bernie this #I like Bernie start popping up that behavior is a direct reaction to her getting pounded on by Donald Trump through the entire campaign are you still there and let me ask you this you've talked to a lot of people from all different Realms in here right if we can agree let's say that being entertaining is not a great prerequisite for qualification for being if we can agree on that what can be done whether it's in the political sphere the media sphere putting something in the drinking water to let people to encourage people to have a little bit more of what you're after whether it's compassion with at understanding whether it's balanced where there's moderation another Ridge why is the entertainment Force winning right now and if you don't like that notion what can be done well the entertainment force is written for whatever reason is being portrayed through Trump only see he's not a politician he's a guy who's a media star he's been a media star for decades he knows how to manipulate the media he knows how to sit on the Letterman couch and kill he's been doing it for a long time is very comfortable being in front of cameras none of those people have those kind of skills and nobody thought of it as a skill they thought of a politician being a politician stuff guys calling you crazy Ted or lying Ted you know lying Hillary heated makes up dance or you sleepy Joe I mean and I'm smiling because it's funny cuz he's good at up he's funny he's good at it there's a problem you should have a goddamn popularity contest to see who controls thermonuclear weapons that's f****** stupid it's stupid tilt allow pee but it's vote but it faces the popularity system we've got and that's what I'm asking you is what now I'm in the way that these election no cuz I don't think it was me if you look at the Lincoln-Douglas debates those are actual debate but I mean let's say that you're not happy with the way it is and there's a lot of people even there are people who like Trump quite a bit on some Dimensions who are very troubled by other dimensions there's a lot of people out there who are open to like no let's let's try to adjust the thinking let's try to change her mind try to not be influenced as much by what we're being influenced by do you have give me pointers the real problem that we're having is this tribal Battle of left vs right and the the strongest voices on the left the loudest voices in The Most Extreme often times are the worst representations and the same with the right the loudest most extreme team member so the people at the front of life okay we're going to kick their ass with me and there's also these ideas that we have that are cemented in stone that you know if you are a left-wing person you believe in XYZ this is your doctor and maybe you think that maybe maybe we should incorporate a lot of things we do with the fire department and you know when do that to schools and do that to housing and do that. Make sure that all the stuff covered make housing like an important part a civilization but for every but we did a piece of Freakonomics radio Pizza year to go cold Americans hidden duopoly and it was about the Democratic and Republican party basically acting like Pepsi and Coke right they kind of divide and conquer the market and they built an industry that is incredibly valuable to me is this Trump won the presidency as the Republican that the RNC most wanted to get rid of Bernie last time found was the Democrat that the DNC wanted to get rid of they lost by getting their candidate Hillary in this time Bernie may very well become the candidate is again the party of the DNC is out to get to what is it say you've got a duopoly literally the machines running the system that we kind of let ourselves get manipulated into buying like you said I've never understood my mom my mom and dad were democrats for a long long time typical Catholic not so difficult as your former Jewish got the typical Catholic working-class big family meat potatoes issues no-brainer that they're Democrats okay and then but my mom is a devout Catholic she started the local right-to-life chapter in Upstate New York where we live New York state has legalized abortion before Roe v Wade so she was fighting that fight early when that happened and the Democrats lined up against in favor in favor of legalize divorce she switched parties everything else about her was still mostly Democratic but she had to become a republican because of life and that's a that's another powerful one that got integrated into the right and it happens to all of us though we take there's one issue that kind of sets people off and then they have to join the team that they met everything else about her was still mostly Democratic but she had to become a republican because of life and that's a that's another powerful one that gets integrated into the right and it happens to all of us do we take there's one issue that kind of sets people off and then they have to join the team that they met</div>

really want to have some kind of service component but I don't know what to do I'm to question I think first start with the people around you right start telling them you love them hug enhance the sense of community that you share with your friends your loved ones do your best to sort of be the person steps forward starts it off you know like makes an action tell someone how much you care and appreciate them I care about them and appreciate them when you maybe wouldn't have done that ordinarily you can we can all do that and we've all had it done to us and it feels amazing when someone comes up to you out of nowhere and goes hey man I just want to tell you I really appreciate you I know I know sometimes we don't talk to each other that much but when I do I really enjoy it I just I love you give me a hug I just want you to know I'm very fortunate that I have a lot of friends that do that kind of stuff real supportive group of friends and if you don't you long for that and I think that's a big thing like become that person really want and try to try to start that I can't imagine anybody hearing you say that would disagree such an Obviously good way to be and yet and yet I find that so many people kind of go out of their way to not just be generous cuz they're scared there's not a scarcity there they think that they have they have to make it and that if you make it 5-0 some are a loser yeah it's thinking it's real real real, our Hardware is the same in our software is not but you understand what it is and then you have that time to adjust that's why losing in life is so important weather is getting dumped getting fired losing a game loss those feelings where things didn't work out your way that's important because it lets you know this is a bad feeling that comes when it goes wrong and you improve and that it makes the good feelings of Victory all the better and I mean that you know when the relative sounds like even getting good at something good about Victory like making terrible book to get rejected by every publisher and then writing a really good one and people accepting like f*** I got better yes like the feelings of failure are really critical for your motivation that's interesting I've always thought of failure like or like like a failure or just like a bad event I've always thought that they were good because I'm like a scaredy-cat in some ways right and then if the very bad thing happens the very beard happens you survive it and then you learn to shed more fear and more directions you know what I mean so I could look at it that way but there's a lot of ways you can look at bad events you can't I a bad event is just who you are and you just have bad events in your f****** loser in life hates you and God hates you and look at that happened in the Mike again can't f****** believe it is a lot of got to go through life like that and you know they can say that they seek comfort in lowering the standards that they expect out of things when things go bad they say lot I f****** knew it for them alleviate some concern about what's going to happen the future cuz of Future's always dogshit know by doing that they've taken away the fear of Rights eating the fear of overcoming the fear of improving the fear of getting better as a human being has exhibit the same patterns you fall into those patterns other is alcoholism a gambling addiction tracks addiction people falling those because they are accustomed to it becomes a normal part of your life I think that's a scary thing for people want to buy pattern and to say okay I have to stop drinking how do I dress right what what steps are make and what's the best way community sponsor now and they work together that's I think the solution is as a really good so you know I have three brothers are all older on the youngest of eight and I don't mean to disparage them and I also know year younger than me but I kind of wish you'd been my old whether you would have been really good maybe Robin sucking up p**** come on man stop crying yeah that's okay with your brother and sister sometimes the only people that really know you like I have conversation with my sister sometimes she's the only person who really knows our childhood rain will talk about it was like 1 or 9 and ran and do you have the same option of it super honest right and she's what I mean you remember you remember yeah yeah yeah anything right we both have real similar Recollections of our past so it's a bit but those people that have experienced those things with you there like the only ones who really know you deep at your core and the more things you can experience with people the more you can share that sort of the people that's make me sad that people have no friends and no confidence they have no one they could talk to let me know when that knows their seat said there's no one that they can tell terrible joke to that you would never say an in mixed company right do you have no one who you know especially comedians We are the world famous for it we say things to each other all the time. Of the most horrible things and just to get a rise out of each other like one of my friends will say something terrible also in our culture there's a currency of being able to joke around like that of course physically if somebody makes one of my friends makes fun of me it's hilarious it's 5 and we do it to each other all the time because it doesn't actually like a currency and be able to take it to like you can make fun of Andrew doesn't give a f*** it's hilarious it's 5 we do it to each other all the time because it doesn't actually like a currency and be able to take it to like you can make fun of Andrew doesn't give a f***</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> chocolate poison has gotten so much better than the fact one wrinkle of climate change and global warming is that the particulate the soot in the atmosphere in the 60 50 60s and 70s with apparently what kept things little bit cooler because it refracted sunlight knee or ankle that's the irony is you clean up the air and you allow more bleeding where when people reduce it to the headlines and then divide people into tribes exactly the opposite of what you want perfect example because it's clearly a right vs left thing too and some people circles if you are on the right you're supposed to say it's exaggerated it's a hoax it's a distance and that's not my concern my concern is jobs my concern is if I give you repeat the talking points and if it's on the left that's how dare you think the biggest I know it's it was not a bad imitation I think one of Obama's biggest mistakes he plainly wanted to address climate change global warming but he did it in a kind of standard left Democrat Way by calling a global warming by saying that there were bad actors which is true the thing that astonishes me that Democrats haven't done is talk about it in a language that every Republican every conservative every Hunter fishing would respond to which is pollution which is what it is by the right right there why why it became a conversation about a much bigger much more abstract much more difficult to understand and act on problem is strange to me because you know humankind comes together we came to look polio vaccine it wasn't like everybody was working on it but there weren't enough people concerned about it and then you had a president who said hey March of Dimes let's have everybody raise money come up with a vaccine and then Christina liew no salt with the vaccine is just interesting about the way medicine works today you basically said no no I don't want to I don't want to own this patent he could have become a billionaire you know this was this is this is the way we have fought in our passes humans about solving big problems we seem to have gotten away from that a little bit and I think that's weird to me that tribalism is the most dangerous it's not about the political charades I don't care about that don't think that's particularly damaging why I think it's damaging is by dividing yourself into these tribes are so exclusive and they have these purity test what we're doing is weird actually diminishing our Collective ability to come together to solve problems the good news is there's a million people out there at academic institutions in garages groups of one and two people who are working on solutions that are that keep coming you know human humans a species Jonas Salk when he did create That vaccine the world was a different place and it wasn't this pharmaceutical industry that we have today that's you know what has such a strong ability to influence the way people look at things through advertisements and just threw the way the influence politicians where is it's a different world to compare what did the Bounty that was awaiting Jonas Salk for coming up with the polio vaccine it's just a different world to the world different he didn't give credit to the other people to help him with the back yet there was an I do I do you read a with money but not good with people I haven't read this in a long time so I can't I can't speak to it but I would even like I've been do you like Richard Fineman you know Richard Fineman so so you know when he talks about and I love hearing him talk about when he was drafted to work on the Manhattan Project and you think about America was it was an existential fear legitimate about all the complications that we have an enormous scientific challenge we have an enormous competition against the Germans were trying to do the same thing and then even if we win then we have another hole challenge is tomorrow challenge but there's a way of thinking about those things that again wet measuring the cost and benefits of people who'd might disagree aggressively and they did about Manhattan Project can sit down and say okay here's here's what we're going to do what's the what's the lesser of the two evils and I feel like right now as much progress as we've had I feel we've gotten worse at looking at the lesser of two evils pass that looking at weighing costs and benefits for what is the lesser of two evils in that regard as it dropped the bombs and stop the war or is the lesser of two evils never drop the bomb and stop the war later yeah I mean look there's a million books been written about this I could make an argument in in either case I mean Japan we were very very scared of Japan Japan and showed a lot of ability to punish the United States even though Germany was out America still felt very fragile so I totally get the argument that it was meant to be you know I get it to ya on the other hand your picking some pretty big city to drop it on and you're picking too so you know killing mostly civilians yeah yeah so it's hard to imagine that decision will be made today you just said about being a polio vaccine different different case but roughly same time you're in you know it's very hard to project your ma rolls onto you know 50 years from now we may have a very different view about MMA friends since it's very hard to protect it for more people literally out of existence but I think that just the fact that these brilliant scientists were forced into that moral dilemma like one of my favorite videos online shopping what is discussing what he said when the first atomic bombs detonated and he pulled the Bhagavad Gita and he said I am become death destroyer of worlds and is just to say that it to see have you seen it the video please let me let me play before you play Oppenheimer right after went describing what it was like cuz it's so Eerie ki'teer you have one of those brilliant scientist ever who completed this fantastic project Manhattan project that literally were nuclear weapons never happened before in all of human history as far as we know and hear the guy that did it that knew that knew that was going to be the death of untold amounts of people listen to this listen to what it says line from the Hindu scripture the bhagavad-gita Vishnu is trying to persuade the prince but now I am become death the destroyer of worlds I suppose we all thought that one way or another imagine being that guy I mean here's a guy first of all according to Bhagavad Gita in 1945 little ahead of his pretty pretty incredible or 40 it was 46 when did they detonate 40 the test where I think 44 and Hiroshima and Nagasaki 45 correct this guy who you know is just a brilliant scientist he's not supposed to be the guy who destroys a half a million people in One Moment One brief flash of light and vaporizes a half a million people he he went to the school in New York City called The ethical culture fieldston school which is where my kids went so Oppenheimer is kind of a patron saint for having the brains to do something unimaginable and having the ethics and courage to know that what he done was unacceptable on some levels you know on the other hand would look if we're talking about costs and benefits let's think about nuclear power nuclear bombs as a deterrent against others down the road rights you have to say killed a lot of people how many lives did it save impossible to say argument right then y'all drive to talk about then that's also talk about nuclear power which was the byproduct of this right and there are those who could argue and I would probably need this argument to say that if the US had continued on the path of nuclear power in the 70s rather than totally flipping out after well after Three Mile Island then later Chernobyl which is much worse accident at Three Mile Island if if that had continued what we have now is probably much much much cleaner cheaper safer nuclear Fuel and instead what happened because we basically stopped building nuclear plant instead for the next forty years we weren't a crap load of coal that's been terrible for the environment for lies a lot of lives lost in mining colder than the pollution so so you know actions have consequences with seems to be all benefit off and has a lot of costs and life is complicated but I think the more with the Wii measure and weigh things sensibly the list screaming there is I I just I love changing my mind I love hearing somebody make an argument that makes me say oh you know the way I thought about that before I see why I thought it I don't feel like a fool for having thought of it wound now that now that you've laid out some facts and laid out some counterfactuals I appreciate the opportunity to change my mind I enjoy that I don't know why I think we're so often you are a Diaz like our ideas are part of us and we're losing if our ideas that we've been discussing or incorrect if our assumptions were incorrect is a value judgment against us right you know I think the nuclear thing is interesting because I think one of the problems with what happened was the shity design of like Fukushima where they can't shut it off as freak people out rightly so and it's in there it's built in a bad spot and The Back-up Plan sucked everything's wrong and hotspot I was going to be like that for a hundred thousand years break there's a better way and they never had a chance to find that better way because they've had a better way for everything else in those later ones the ones that their operational now are far better than the Fukushima month and they could have gotten way way way way way better and that is it's one of those things that doesn't seem like a make sense like women nucleares clean it's working really clean it's really clean if it's done right and if they allow them to innovate over those forty years we would have got to someplace where it's like super efficient just like everything else if you look 1970 car right and then you look at a car from 2020 how did Tesla like maybe they would figure out how to really knock it down so that means there are still a lot of people working on next next next next Generation nuclear power MacLean Bill Gates's involved and including some that are working with using as fuel with called spent fuel in a traditional nuclear attack traditional nuclear a big problems at 1 so it's eventually going to crack do the bunker and toxify everything around it maybe before you could also theoretically use that as literally as fuel also</div>

fishes Community First Village Star by this guy was in construction and he just put down a whole bunch of tiny homes and people who are if your homeless you can go there and you can live in a tiny home but you rent it and there are some no some prerequisites but you don't have to be drug free because you're home so you can do whatever you want in your home but it's like $200 or $250 a month most people if they do the paperwork I can get the Social Security or disability which will cover that they still have to either work there in the community garden to feed themselves at different like I auto detailing at all this different stuff but there's no police saying it's not near as 500 people there now and it's working out fantastically can't get money to that because you're f****** god nuts or whatever it is but it's really working extremely well that's great when someone comes up with something you know I don't look at this Alan Graham is the saying what what he did and he lives there he lives in a small in a small home on Primacy and if you go there he'll be happy to show you around and all kinds of cool stuff at but it's just people are living together he says so if Joe walks out in the morning not Yu-Gi-Oh but the other he's got his his his dick hanging out and instead of the neighbors calling the cops the neighbors Hey Joe what's going on man will sit down for second step of coffee let's see what's going on 30 pants up your local city council your Mayors always a lot of people with mental illness who have houses so you know it's definitely mental illness and drug addiction but it really starts with catastrophic loss of family that's the number one reason people become unhoused out here it's the shift was Jimmy would you say about four or five years ago it really started kicking in somewhere around then yeah somewhere around four or five years ago you start noticing like Villages of tents under under passes and then at least you Fear Factor in Downtown LA like right down the street from Skid Row which is an extraordinary place if you've never seen skid-row and you drive by and go what this is real like this is downtown Los Angeles and you You're Beautiful by the way Kid Rock which is just you can't believe the Staggering numbers of people that are just camped out Stadium to see a game Adam Carolla said we got to do something about whatever you're doing and that's part of cancel culture people are afraid you know you could cancel culture was real if you have something to lose like you got nothing to lose I have nothing to lose they did your on your bulletproof do degree I'm bulletproof cancel all you want you taken away for me to do advertisers I don't have them stop listening</div>

Jamie gopher was basically the World Wide Web only was no web and so you could log on to a terminal and you could use a menu system so basic with the arrow keys but if you go to the right you might be connecting to a different computer to different University I eat a different server and then you can have a tattoo as they say all these information documents linking to each other and I started one piece of mtv.com like I went to him and said hey I don't want to do this thing on the internet and I wear a lot of our audiences and I want to register mtv.com yeah that's cool don't worry about it we have the AOL keyword so you go ahead and do a little in it that thing their son do whatever you want I got an email from the University of Michigan or that the Gophers is at their symbol Michigan thank you and they said dude you're using this commercial you have to pay us $5,000 for a license and like just for the server software which is open for free but they it was something in the license MTV and I said okay and there's a video on YouTube with me with a gopher t-shirt on MTV and then we like all mankind Urbana Illinois and those Marc Andreessen. He went on to create the biggest VC in Silicon Valley and when I saw that picture took an hour to download p*** video look at that I was like what the number what it was girl giving guy b****** it only lasted like 15 South was there ever a moment when was the moment I should say Obviously now today we all realize it's out of our control and it's a wild very strange thing that's taking over alive and then I want to talk about neural link to know something about that about Elon musk's invention neuralink I know a little bit about it but when you were we when you saw it kind of getting away like when was the moment where you were like this is a very strange thing it's never the people before I had the online part figured out because I ran a bulletin board you might remember those you could call in and maybe like five lines and you go in and do your business and then get out and who years that this is got to be early 80s maybe even late 70 so there's time for Innovation that right is big long strap things don't get any better well the speed got marginally better people got more online step the computers are able to do more than over there also some other things happening we had Windows Windows 95 came into play so now people were wearing a different world of computing used to be. And people have him wordperfect and and then all of a sudden we have an interface on top of it and we didn't have that the show that started to teach people how to deal with the environment so that was all there but the self would be 1987 and I login to get on the unit you had to log into a dial-up account launch a PPP session or slip and then had lunch the software on your computer and then you could open a terminal and you could type things like telnet and then a domain name or Indian IP address it could connect to someone else's thing and kind of look around was just all text-based but that for me was like holy ship you can connect from one to the next I understood the hyperlinking I understood how powerful that would be and if I just had a little computer today on my desk had a Mac plus with a gigantic external 20 megabytes cuz he hard drive 20 megabytes hdpt Mosaic browser browser the web and then the third moment was Carl Jacob Facebook but at the time and he contacted me so I can see what you're doing to send you a computer and sent me a Sun Voyager which is like a portable a luggable with an LCD color screen is UNIX which is even crazier and so he started show me stuff and he actually stream the song from his work station in San Francisco to my computer in Montclair New Jersey and I played I had him on the phone here I heard him start it and then it came through and it played on my on my computer I've never seen this before or heard it was like broadcast we can use this to broadcast since that moment I think that's the mission I've been on and look at Mama I have a ride here we are that's an amazing story man that's cool as f*** I love hearing it from someone was there from the very first steps and your we used to have the yellow page of the internet Yellow Pages which was a book I still have it it was published was published right that's it fell apart that's what happened with newspapers he was with the newspapers f***** up with the news when the internet came around and there were I saw it other people saw Craig Newmark saw it and it's classifieds because they were all hoity-toity about their advertising model but they're really making money off the classified ads everybody knows it everybody knew it and that's what Craigslist who you try to sell it to Tribune Tribune or Hurst for just a couple million bucks and it's like now we're not interested we don't need it not invented here whatever and so he ate up there their they're classified business overnight and they were left holding the bag saying but we have cool news to advertise on well-known and I will put some in there but not always about the classified that's where the money came from the more I can tell the story of the story about how they passed on it and he's very well the classified ads do they even have them newspaper Obits dead people is that still a good business the Obits dead people is that still a good business to have some but no not really how often do you hold a physical newspaper in your hand to read it whenever I whenever I'm at the airport I always buy the newspapers</div>

Breathwork the ends very interesting it's not against anything and distract myself cuz I'm floating you know when you drift into the wall sometimes so I wait until the ripples died down and climb and there's going to be like a little bit of George Ranch and when you lay down once the water gets still then I let my hands go and then I just think about breathing and I thought I am not a wizard at this right eye goes in and out I think about I forgot to call that guy got to send an email and then if I just stay vigilant and make sure I was okay when I get back on the road and the road is thinking only of the breathing only of the in and out in and out I just visualized are coming in and out of my lungs and just died alone while line the tank and put me in a trance and it takes a while but I can do it quicker because I've done it for years because the tanks in normal thing I get in at the most I always think his I should do this more often that's what I usually think but I can get in the trance but just thinking about the breathing what line the tank of put me in a trance but I can do it quicker because I've done it for years because the tanks and normal thing I get into the most I always think his I should do this more often that's what I usually think but I can get in the trance but just thinking about the breathing</div>

It does not it depends entirely on what you're doing no joke names of whether or not you get punished twice for the same crime so if they can prove exactly the same way they proved with John if it was things happening is that the testing is getting far better so they can test you for stuff now that a year ago is absolutely impossible for sure so the threshold right now that day or said his was confusing to me the threshold that they tested John was supposed to be more then vodka yes and then the deny the fight this is where it gets weird me the night of the fight to commission testing them all the same. Cuz I'm pissed commission USANA &amp; Final Tustin St piss you sodded didn't report anything commissioner before anything right in about you claim to fight but then bada did with you Sade up in the rulebook no matter if it's Pecos whatever is if you get flagged it doesn't matter if it's from residue whatever is you cannot compete until that is out of your body that's the rule book black and white it don't say well speak still good doesn't matter we cannot Grant you the license to compete in which is why they don't suspect that's why I honestly think why they're doing this because they don't know exactly how this is happening I think they have been there series which you know it works right now but ultimate they don't really know what's going on so if they were to suspend John and he's really not taking Chase to the f*** out of them so I think double jeopardy stuff in the system is no indication that he has recently taken it which is not the same drawing Powers John what happens if someone takes say you take creatine the creatines tainted and you have some forbidden substance in your system and it supposed to only play in your system for 6 months if it's the certain stuff but now the testing gets better and so now instead of punishing you for something that you accidentally took and then they test you and they say off we can prove you accidentally took it so when we going to give you a six-month suspension bit after 6 months is over they can still tested in you why because it's got better what do they do now because in the past they would have said it's time served for the you want you don't want to punish a guy for something you've already punished him for if you proven that it's this is what he took with it but that the rulebook is it so you can only compete when you pass the tab you read this will guess yes discussions about this was he think he should be allowed to compete because getting a license to fight that is the rule that's explain the most all the fighters that the real problem would be is what if it's proven at some point I meant to say a big Thrift what if rather than one time that they can tell if you've ever taken anything ever your whole life and they just disqualify anyone forever even if it's an actual shift test you started testing their parameters are based off of Olympic that's right they stop suspending guys 2 to 4 years you know f***** up that is to do a fighter like Josh Barnett that house Smalls your windows not we're not the Olympics don't come every four years it's such a small one or two to four years baby got a guy who's hired some Victor Conte type individual back when Victor was doing this with the other clear any higher some guy in this guy get some on some s*** that no one knows what it is and he's just running through people and he's looking like yoel Romero on smashing people but he's rebuilding it and everybody's like I don't buy it something's wrong and then one day you catch him ever again how many people are cheating right and what should the punishment be should be based on how many people are cheating or should be based on the philosophy we're trying to get cheating out of the sport I don't know whoever can get it out as you do you wish that the Japanese were super crazy strict about steroids back before Pride point for letting a guy like him take something so he can recover you know cuz he's 40 years old he still enjoys fighting but his body doesn't produce testosterone the right way anymore testosterone use exemption VTOL jet</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> any further we should give you credit you're the reason why all this started you are the original podfather soda legitimate one like if there's a lot of people claiming that you're the guy who made the very first podcast you even keep up with the name of it right I didn't come up with the name of podcasting was invented in 2004 anyone was podcasting before there was an iPod interesting late I was living in Amsterdam at the time and working with Dave Winer Who had who really invented blogging and he hadn't created this RSS syndication format and he had software you could block and then an aggregator kind of like no Google Reader at the time that you can read blogs and it was kind of like a two-way communication thing was interesting and lot of people starting to use it in Amsterdam they had cable modems ruled out everywhere and cable modems was sold the time as always on internet it wasn't fast it was just f****** on you didn't dial in which was oh my God this is great this was a huge Improvement and have to kick someone off the phone line all of that so the the experience of multimedia was s*** like you want to hear a song or play a video is like click wait wait wait download-wake-me-up it would probably download an open up some kind of player than it was not an experience there's nothing nothing there that made sense so and I always want to broadcast on the unit that's always been my thing from the moment I saw it so I came up with this concept of the last yard so what if you had a little thing running on your computer in the background that would know if there's something you wanted let's just forget the Howard nose part it would download it and would tell you that there was something new when it already had it on its local hard drive so you remove the whole wait experience cuz you don't know you don't know that this computer's been downloading something you it just tells you how it's here it's not abnormal in Media or the 6 News most of its produced before the actual broadcast so I took this idea to Dave and I said we need to come up with something that can download a media file that I program somehow like this is going to show up and then it download it and only tells me when it's there and I can click on it plays immediately and it took some convincing he didn't exactly understand what I was saying he probably thought that's f****** MTV guy gets f*** out of here that's exactly what you thought and what I wanted to do in his own software and he said okay I'm going to do this but only on the condition never ever ever f****** use my software again because that was horrible what you just did and so we created the enclosure element in RSS and so for two years we were doing back and forth like movie files stop and don't click and would open up in the experience was good until I saw my first iPod friend of mine to look at this and like the white one with the big, it was a good one right there for awhile like hard drive and I looked at him went this is not a solid state receiver programming and so I said about again with my fantastic programming skills skills to make a little application and the dye pot at the time you still had to sync it to iTunes is how you got music onto it back in the day and so you could put a an MP3 file into a blogpost basically but it was a special attachment really and so this program would just be looking all the time it's just something new something new something new download it then QuikTrip it so that it's synchronized to the iPod and it works now not being a programmer actually Kevin marks the guy was working at Apple same to you a version of the script that actually work that was helpful and I set about creating a radio show but we didn't have a name podcast yet and I wanted to be able to talk to developer software developers who could create receiver Sony we had by Potter I Potter should I Potter lemon all the all these different applications which kind of did the same thing and because I was talking to developers I called it the daily source code so I did every day and source code is kind of what the developers working and I was really talking to them like the guys over in New Zealand 8 and they've created this version of the iPhone is really working well and we discovered all kinds of crazy s*** like you subscribe to a feed because we don't have thought it through try and download know everything you had feed all at once so try to download 50 episodes and we still had kind of always on internet help with everything with Crunch and die and this just kept building and building other people started doing these and we called and soliloquies and little bundles of joy and all kinds of really dumb names and the Denny Gregoire guy who was just listening to podcast and the name stock Ben hammersley from the Guardian years earlier had actually use the term podcast somewhere in article which has no podcasting at the time but he envisioned that and then called it podcast so really fast before I knew what the BBC was calling in the interviews here and then I'm like holy s*** something blowing up here and it wasn't until that that's a big moment was I got a call from Steve Jobs and he says I can watch it with Eddy cue big-man-on-campus there now so can you meet with Steven like an hour and it was and I had a lot of interesting that he busy dude my my best meeting to date had been Quincy Jones where I got drunk with him for an hour on live radio show that was Steve Jobs really heard before two of us is Maddie's f****** pissed off and is yelling about the f*****-up Wi-Fi and I learned later that his his plan always for the iPhone was to not be a cell phone but to use Wi-Fi networks around the world and it really wouldn't be that scene was for that was his his vision and actually I thought to myself probably come down just to make sure and then he was talking about Eddy cue says yeah you know the Raa called and they got a problem with the with our able to record sounds on the macneill breaking any kind of encryption and I said important because in order to record stuff we using like audio hijack Pro and all these different kinds of tools and I said Mom and I hope hope they don't do that because it's kind of important for production to see you f*** it down to f*** themselves this is tools are guys need on him and then he said I'd like to put podcasting an iTunes are you okay with that I like are you kidding me yes I'll give you my director that built the directory of pothead I'll give you that the started off absolutely and then I was kind of funny so then maybe what year was this 2004 2004-2005 time frame and then they can find if you want it's a pretty funny video so he announces this on stage playing my my podcast where I just rail on the Mac it's if they're really legitimizes me in the world of podcasting thank you Steve I really appreciate it. You got to check this out this is hilarious free radio invented podcasting and now he has a podcast called The Daily Source let me go ahead and subscribe to that and now we can go listen to his latest one and just click on it do with 500k do you know exactly what he was doing bro I'm telling you he went on to raise lot of money from those companies to build my podcast Network what was the first what year was your first podcast the first one you released also that was 2003 I guess what was going on before you was there anything was there any other people did putting a video and audio if you remember that low-grade streaming stuff and with this really made it did two things I mean it's all the problem for downloading that was the first and now that's no longer an issue of course so it but it did put the subscription model in the place and because neither I or de why nor have ever patented any of this it's completely free and open so no one owns it and that was that was the mission I'm very proud of that that's beautiful because otherwise if someone Spotify is now trying to buy podcasting by buying up all these networks and they'll make it exclusive and Grant trying to switch from a music company to an audio company but ultimately look at all the applications that are out there that are really good people love them the Apple podcast app I use overcast I like that a lot there's any of tons of different ones and it's all because it's an open standard that no one can control in Silicon Valley loves control in a Walled Garden locked into Apple stuff know then you have they didn't have many different ways they could do stuff or they could help but I don't know why I don't know why they're not I think it's I think they thought for the longest time that I was just this thing that people did that was no big deal and then it's become so enormous but they still have this Mount this model of their operating under that it's just they're just aggravating could be I mean what was interesting is when they started off they immediately start to highlight NPR programming which I'm not I'm grateful for WGBH in Boston did a lot with the putting their first programs make nose available as podcast but kind of the the beauty of the amateurism of podcast and got pushed down a little bit and it was all BBC and PR CVS a little too much for me the Radiolab Isle of Radiolab but I know what you're saying it's very produced it's right like people answer questions for the ghazt instead you look hot in it so what he said was this why you just let him say it</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> it's just nuts how much money is involved in in and how many people look away and people are trying to stop different flavored tobacco smoke I see you're a vapor will that that I actually look into that very very deeply and now this was that the tobacco industry had a problem the problem was this I kicked the cigarettes with this cuz it's just me or not things happen the lung issues and I don't know who you know personally but there was a surge don't know anybody personally there was a scare in the scare killed a couple of people like 10 people and would have turned out was that was people who would Vaped THC cartridges and some putting him the people who put the you buy your THC cartridge from a dispensary here it's actually package by somebody else not by that person so you have new king World whatever it is different here that's kind of a reputable brand but it's somewhere else that means putting it in your putting the stuff in and they put in some vitamin E acetate and that just have like created a Whitney of heat that up and became a web of some s*** inside your lung and f***** you up so that's an odd thing but that nothing to do with vaping nicotine with with the typical chemicals do you get from reputable companies The Vaping from marijuana with their processes more problematic than vaping of tobacco well he was in that case let someone change the formula then you need to have some some oil in there and work keep it near liquid in Fort just for it to be able to go into the Vape and not the issue was actually the vitamin E oil so that's top of course somewhere someone did something shity and that happened really high guy actually said this to me once he told me that he uses organic MCT oil for his you vape I don't even know you you could be a crazy person you can be a DMT Vape DMT Vape now you might be going into orbit for 20 minutes not quite the same as death by helicopter controlling the rotations of a bolts very delicate like literally the amount of effort you put if you like you if you watch a good player the amount of effort they put really accurately depicts how many Revolutions of the cutest Georgia and after its colliding with the object ball and you get more sensitive that when you're high is another one a lot of people do Jiu Jitsu it's really, most perfect Landing ever it when I was super into it anyway so we had a real issue also comes back to the States because there's this master agreement that was put in place decades ago that tobacco companies would pay a percentage of their sales to all states to free compensation for whatever fuckedupshit people get from smoking tobacco and all the states wrote big bonds against that money and so when the income from the tobacco companies would decreasing significantly because of vaping all of a sudden the states are going especially this one what the f*** Brooke so everyone had an incentive to get rid of vaping get people back on Tobacco so they Ultra bought juul the debate that the main thing this is Hardcore this is Jewel is a prepackaged product kids were buying it like over a juul you can control how much can you put a fan put whatever you wanted and not just limited by what juul wants to sell you and went back to the cuz you like the story okay so so tobacco States everyone's keyed-up they buy juul for 18 billion dollars they buy it as a write-off they want to get this company out of the market then they go to the FDA and they start all this s*** about flavors flavors flavors flavors you start everywhere it was it was a perfect storm 10 people dying from vaping something completely unrelated but vaping Theory cigarette he died it was actually now you babe but you vape too bad teeth THC cartridge and now got a severe problem so you know how the media plays that and it just kept like what we have to stop the children in the way you stop it is by taking away the flavors cuz children they want flavors that's what the problem is so that's f***** Jewel over and then actually Altria Philip Morris Bass pesos the biggest tobacco company they start they already wrote down half of it but I just taken L on it they want to get rid of it because in the wings they had their Computing products which is iqos I quit ordinary smoking small icapital qos and he eats tobacco so it's a it looks like a vape pen and has but it's actually runs on Tobacco and it doesn't burn it it Heats it up has whatever some kind of mechanism in the filter you inhale and is almost there dream which is the smokeless very close to it but most importantly it's not a nicotine synthetic nicotine it is tobacco product which is their business and they got they really ratchet this up so high that they got Trump involved and Trump actually with Melania is that they did a thing with Alex Azar the Health and Human Services secretary he said well we have a kid actually was one of those moments were I'm about to jump on Trump he said Melania has a kid forgot to say was his whatever it was and now she overheard saying I wish I'd never gotten involved in that f****** thing because he figured out he's figured out was a huge scam the bill has been stopped but now they're still trying to push through a bill that will help the tobacco companies even more by outlawing any type of flavored e-cigarettes or juice liquid or they just want to get rid of it so it's really like who killed the electric car wait exactly that they just go look at it out iqos they launching this news stories today to say oh my God it's the Saving Grace we have the new product we've all been waiting for that right at the moment that vaping is going to kill you it's hooking children because of flavors so do you think they're they're hiring people to write news stories and the News organizations are picking you up because they're being told to do this release to do press on it so easy to medium oh by the way we're all three so we're going to buy five hundred million dollars worth of advertising over the next five years would you please run our story or do you might want to look at this, tobacco so do you think that they make a deal before they accept a press release to do advertising or do they wait a little bit television subject and it would be a good subject a lot of people paying attention to it it would get a lot of ratings if you have a lot of stories about over-medication of children what is going on to be something you would be interested in and yet they don't do it because the advertising found these days because I'm sure that I'm being blanketed with so many ads that eventually I'm going to get Propecia eventually I'm going to get high blood pressure I'm getting my dick's not going to work cuz that's what you're telling you every every commercial block now Land Two Half Men and what's the other one Doug and Carrie I don't watch those are one of two countries in the world that allows advertised as far as Australia is the other either one but for whatever reason sorry either one cup call out the wrong one of those thinking but that for whatever reason that everybody else is like what are you crazy and once we got it in there it's like 1 something becomes something that everybody does we are crazy it's really difficult to fix</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> live right now please let everybody know we're talking about Cheech &amp; Chong's album Big Bad bows Ashley key with a real rolling paper magic you just across that thing was across the double the double album you have a flip phone I wanted to be a little more connected to life outside so call people could well this is so this is actually a new flip phone from T-Mobile Alcatel and it has kaios which is so it's not really a trackable OS although Google put in and the further I got into it the more I liked it ain't no really need it now I have a device with me that's off this works as a hotspot so I can turn into a hotspot if I really really really needed to do something but what you need right asked phone call right and if there's something that I really need to look up you just turn around and say hey I really am serious about it well you should be should be at all this great technology but the business model f***** us all I mean 6 years ago at the first Amazon Echo and like this is groundbreaking Dvorak might my co-host he was laughing at me like why would you bring a spy device into your house that look I'm just testing this out if an Apple logo on everyone be losing their s*** right now but it didn't and I loved it hook it up to the light and all that stuff going and then as I started to understand what it was really doing and what's really communicating all these things by down to like your Roku remote you pick that up it's communicating with home base to all the steps I got rid of all of it and was something valuable the right we didn't realize it was a commodity and it's being sold not just a commodity that's kind of a lie but insanely extremely that's why we're Facebook makes all their money that's where Google make all their money everybody yeah everybody get from your data and you never really understood what you were doing when you signed off to give that data way up when you sign the terms of agreement so you like yeah yeah yeah whatever plaid for five billion dollars and it's the the financial back-end kind of like a bridge between all these apps that can do stuff with your bank account and your bank account so instead of so if you have an app like venmo or name any payment patch app I didn't want to disparage anyone who might be advertised but what you do is you sign up and you literally give this app your username and login to your bank account instead of an API or some kind of programming interface just lets the app talk to your bank account and put money in take it out he can do anything if in fact it is just like scream screen scraping it's going to can go through anything that's connected to your bank account it can look at and they do and and Credit Karma another great a great example of it and they are just sucking out all of your information you pay your bills will you pay first White you know if if you have know what your pattern is of of credit card payment moving stuff around so you think you're just using it as a as a utility but they're tracking your f****** life really concerned about this edible right that this connection that we have to technology gets deeper and deeper into our lives but what what disturbs me is that they're these giant corporations or notches profiting off of our connection but then they're using that money that influence to affect a lot of things in our culture will they just leaving you a credit karma is a great example which also just sold for 7 billion dollars it was literally changing your behavior to get a higher credit score and this credit score believe in official credit score someone that they kind of made up so they'll say pay your utilities on time then we'll raise your credit score your credit score is higher now we can lend you this money is he so they're training people to do certain things like the progressive app for insurance it's training you to drive in a quote-unquote responsible manner because you get discounts if you don't break too hard if you're not accelerating if you're not breaking speed limit to tetra so who knows your speed and everything is monitoring everything you're breaking velocity all of that they take that into consideration every month when the whole point is to train the user to be a good fiscally good person you never that. It's just because you want to save some money well course everyone does that mean you're going to be forced into it like I just got health insurance new health insurance and they're both download the app and if you download the app brake why because they're going to tell me to do things is Apple saying now it's small things but it'll start telling you to stand up and move around and if and if you'd follow it if you follow it then you'll get a discount so we're really really becoming and slave that way that's that is definitely way to look at it that makes sense I mean that they would be the best way to figure out if you're actually a good driver over just some dick it'll get so lucky. Well yeah I mean that's kind of the marketing is a good guy don't worry about it but they keep pushing the keep pushing and you don't have to have the app active for that to be tracked and monitored that was one of the grossest arguments are heard after the whole Snowden thing like what do you care if you're not breaking the law that's changing a little bit daughter and she definitely had that that mindset and her friends did was changing and I was like okay we totally get it there tracking all of our ships so we're going to might not use this will leave the phone at home there's a little bit of that creeping in but in general it's like crack you know how can you know it's not easy it sometimes like I could but no really mean to do this night typically now when I feel any sort of anxiety or boredom I just grabbed the phone it just instantly my little lamb a little soothing blanket or my little teething thing absolutely anything Key I play a game with myself walking on the street holding the phone in the hand one point women holy crap got two phones sometimes with little button plugs it doesn't fall off they got their bag maybe they got the kid or a stroller into Popeye finally doing on and just the all over the place all the time so it's 1.4 just holding it too if you're walking and doing something to see a lot of that how many points if you have a kid and you're walking and looking at your phone that seems like that be a bonus points if you're in the car 10 points if you're walking with the kid on the phone it's five points crazy zombies we start to really pay attention to it when you're above people have a truck and I want to look down on my truck you can see people texting and stunning how many people are on the highway texting at the same time got rear-ended with my truck say maybe two months ago in Austin stop light and turn left I wasn't in the truck and the whole front end is destroyed cheese days and like some trying to pry the door open and yep there I see the phone on the floor still open and then her excuse was on my break didn't work times 5 times a day I'm sure crazy yeah it's it's weird that that sort of snuck up on us at this thing that's incredi incredibly addictive I was with my family this past weekend in Dallas and we're at this event as we're walking through this crowd I'm like Luke how many people on their phones this now crazy like everyone it's the store and everyone is just looking at their phone just it's like a zombie movie they don't know they're zombies a zombie apocalypse truly in the weirdest why when he gives you a little bit of reward every now and then someone has a funny meme and I figured out is that the pavlovian response and the all the all the brain impulses you get from a like or retweet or whatever it is or even just That's not healthy looking Valley figured out is that the pavlovian response and the all the all the brain impulses you get from a like or a or a retweet or whatever it is or even just tell me</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> hearing aid cuz you took him out when you got in put the headphones on and just this is from listening to music too loud know that would you think you think you think now I have a genetic problem that I didn't know about until three years ago and so it's not and I went to the Audiology what happened I started noticing and I've been together for a couple years I start noticing I was saying excuse me wouldn't hear stuff or she would say something that I couldn't remember hearing and and I brought it up to her and I said what you think I asked you to repeat something a lot and then to the TV is very loud so really the TV is very loud so do I don't even realize that so much an audiologist and lo and behold my grandmother my dad's side was completely deaf almost from her teens I have some of this but it's been okay only as you get older everything the levels need to see like here here's a level where you can hear everything and I was already kind of there so now it's just due to age is everything goes down a bit and so I'm missing 1K and we kill her something missing different different tones an audiologist and said it's very mild but yeah this can make you repeat stuff and it will get worse over time and what actually happens to a lot of men in particular isolated from the world they don't even realize that they have a hearing problem and now the difference between having them in and taking him out it's massive just like I can hear how much less it is another clue was that I have a for my oh my podcast Radio work out of headphone but I put an extra amplifier on it you can see you can still hear it today sometimes I'm talking in Little League just a little bit cuz I have it so loud now that's not going to damage my ears but anything you put in your ears you don't you can't hear the sounds anymore and I like it are processing req is very important to me so I can hear that without the hearing aids but not with hearing aids so your grandpa's new geriatric Brown goofy looking piece of s*** that makes you look like a just a total moron victim card okay to get a probably a plate boundaries I do pine trees so these are the widex evoke these have 35 channels of compressor limiter multiple settings it's an ear so goes right into my ear I still have a little bleed through from the outside world but because usually audiologist dicks this thing in your ears makes you do all the tests and then they'll sit there and listen to cross me and they're going to program it so that you can then he abnormal sound I was just very it's a very good to get to get trained professionals very hard to fix someone who is never heard what is proper I'm a little different and I'm also waiting to sound and it's a whole rack of $3,000 it's a huge Racket and the way they do it is to manufacture you can't buy from the directly or retail can only buy it through an audiologist so they already getting half the money from the other 1500 lease and you have I have a 10 appointment with all this money that goes on top and then you come back after a couple months next week if you come back again so I said look see who I am told you what I do give me the f****** software she said I was going to give it to you I just wanted to do one session with you so you have to have this so I have any free programs like six different programs so I can do one just for music I can do one for television one for so situations and I have one that the night so I did it all myself all these 50-35 different channels of compressor limiter when I'm walking around What I Hear on my ears is like a radio show like the sound that I like when I'm talking right now I hear my own voice and it all resonate subject all that up so I've made my own sound reality of sound but I also have one I can set it to a setting in the mall I can conversation from 50 feet away is you can't have headphones cuz that that doesn't work having the hearing aids in with the headphones with the sound that you're blasting into the microphone and it really doesn't work that's crazy though that you can hear people Focus you can have an automatic so the problem is the way I set it up you can drop a pin there if I don't see it I might hear it over there now that's always going to be a problem they have to have an algorithm that will try to guess where the sound is from and tell your ears that so basically I'm not the guy you want in the battlefield ESO just doesn't work with headphones that's why I take them out it's amazing though they sound incredibly potent like oh yeah you remember me and you know what real sound sounds yes. Everything sound real to you or that very well what you automatically do because I was able to do it at different settings for different situations so if I'm at home quiet or we have some music on what happened to Tina frequency which is now kind of like 1 kilohertz and and that's where I hear her better and so that's jacked up a little bit I mean if I hear you talk I can hear it'll be a little eye candy is not exactly you so little to tinny maybe so but that's just me and that's not everyone's experience of course but to me it's the disability has become an incredible Joy because I like virtual reality on my head chat filter what cartoon is really Advanced I mean you can connect to an iPhone so you can you can stream wirelessly you can do it like you driving with directions with the maps and you can just be talking than in your ear all seems like the light turn right no one else hears it does no wires no nothing I got you wouldn't even know I had him in unless you look yeah the road to TransUnion is unripe but how can you say you're against the way you you're enjoying this thing this to me is more it's not a replacement it's an enhancement artificial carbon fiber legs you can feel but they can run Dallas light all this f****** cool just like I'm just looking at the Bleak landscape ahead of us by the way be where I just want to say something because there's a lot of they're not called hearing aids to cause hearing amplifiers they have some fuzzy legal language they're coming on the market that you put all the way in the ear the rechargeables got a whole bunch of them that much much cheaper from the audio standpoint I've done it for years that's not the way you want to go if you seriously want to know how to if you want to hear properly again so I see an audiologist is what I'm saying and has lots of different it's not all three and a half thousand dollars is more expensive but don't I just recommended this itself testing is not a good idea one of the best pool players in the world and Shane is deaf he was born deaf and when he plays he shut his hearing aids off and it just it's a world of Silence just playing a complete total silence and when he does that when he shuts his his hearing it off he feels like he's got super concentration of it doesn't matter what else is going on always doing is just focusing on the balls and there's no that that sense doesn't exist so he can he's hyper focused on other things and I noticed that sometimes when I walk with noise-cancelling headset anything give me more tuned in the deers are offline a mountain lion could be running behind you and you listen to f****** all things considered and I think about it if you can't hear the mountain line frequencies anymore and it today is mountain lion is new car engines all kinds of stuff you can't hear it's dangerous and no idea until I know we haven't new relationship no so we've been living together for a couple years and lucky wake me up we will completely open and honest like hey whatsup cool with that exist though I mean that's an elegant solution and for someone like you it's actually gives you a chance to take her which yet and I'm sure I'm sure you really enjoy that part of it and yeah that exists though I mean that's an elegant solution and for someone like you it's actually gives you a chance to take her which yet not sure I'm sure you really enjoy that part of it yeah yeah you love that small thing</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> yeah he's Android iPhone I have a stripped-down I called quotes that no SIM card VPN Pi hole is a lot of different parts on it that I do carries iPhone 7 if I need to just no ignore other apps on at no extra I was just just blanket use the GPS and also has an iCloud account that's not news not in my main iCloud account so right that's I'm trying to make that Adam Curry and remove my other digital footprint it over a little bit or something and he's confused wow linux-based I'm trying to think of the one that's on the Levites crowdfunded this company actually they make laptops that are completely out all Open Source Hardware should change the name of that country it's so stupid now it's the weed these companies are hooked on it so the data they have to keep getting data from us that's the system so we start to cut it down then move to the hardware they move to different different types of ways of getting data and you're right now I mean you still can't hide from cell phone triangulation near this all kinds of ways people can find you that's really the biggest problem if you can track someone's location you can build their life add a credit card to that meaning she does the company's taxes with family business and she kind of thinks used to do some kind of auditing in the past and she'll call up and say here's what I always see you do and she'll tell me exactly what I do where I go when I like to eat out cuz all these patterns for fun do you have GPS on your car 2015 allows you to completely turn off tracking when you got an iPhone 7 once again like a 69 Corvette slapping it looks like a real problem but it's still going to believe them bloop right I don't want it cuz I have control over keeping it off and not using it when I'm on the road but as a basic thing if I'm at home and I just want to serve I'm sitting down I'd rather use that absolute Apple I got to trust Apple to degree him that they're pretty good about not selling stuff they know so their Maps is wood would be what I use I trust that yeah but only as far as I can throw them and then I'm sure that the million guys going Curry have no idea how I do which is no I mean it's one of those things that it's like Mandela effect okay right like the Berenstain Bears Mandela effect but for whatever reason well that's it they okay so these guys who grew up under the don't be evil I thought it was don't do evil but that was in a was in the s-1 document and I remember reading it and I but maybe they change that halfway and wait from don't be evil to don't do the right thing or either way teal and this was a the company Inc you tell which is a venture capital company which is the cia's it's not a secret that the cia's they was a venture capital company and they invest in stock and they helped the keyhole acquisition and Keyhole is the mapping that's what they were Google Maps was the most important thing you can have it as a poor person's identity is where they are kind of grew up oppression of Russia but come from and they kind of came into the system if you look at the universities and the people involved and how they were almost given some kind of prizes for things they did and there's no alternative story to the general narrative about Google came to be so I think there was a lot of intelligence people involved in this involved in setting it up and the psychology of Larry and Sergey some psychologists have analyzed don't listen to a lot of different people is it they kind of become what they were pressure was to them and it's not really I don't think it bad guys but this is site and psychosis that happens if you grow up in some kind of stressed out situation your people who have been abused often abused others and so I think that's what's going on at the problem is I love all the technology I love with all these companies and everybody's doing the business model is f****** Humanity as it's f****** Us by giving away data and influencing people not letting us that day. Letting us share in in the revenue of the data we're having some control over it nothing Lord looks at it for what it really is like or what is data I mean what is money money is data money money is not is not Monday anymore waldeck is biting a serve it all day. It's all data relationship and it's their business model is what at it as it is now they don't change it no legislation will stop them from getting around the problem but now it's you get free s*** and we get your data you get a free browsers intercept your day the internet is although no longer quite the same way with up upstream and downstream being equal due to any of the cable companies how did implemented your personal connection we can still do our own servers it doesn't all have to be on YouTube on Facebook on Twitter No Agenda social.com is our own social network it's with open source software without algorithms and Yuri Federer age all these other servers much the way the World Wide Web grew up and and there's this mechanism for communicating with each other until it's kind of Twitter me to email only it's just it looks like Twitter just but you control a lot more of how it works and your community can be a small little community and you have no one come in you can block people are just at only want these cool people to also connector that server to connect it's all good seeing all these kind of looks like an ancestry.com tree that just always in the place is called the Federation if we build upon those kinds of things and don't let other companies companies at all there's no reason for them to get involved it's very cheap we believe or not of Linux laptop you can get started and you kids can learn how to do it they could be teaching it's cool how to setup a server how to get around some of the hurdles understand how email server work and we will not need these companies all the joy and a lot of the downside but they won't be a Twitter police still be only your own little Community say hey we don't like this guy was going to block you or your whole Community or we would love to have you guys with us and we going to happen to us similarly and that's how you build these networking eventually you connect to each other on the back and somehow anyway how often you think how long do you think it's going to be before were implementing augmented reality into our life in that way in like a social-media contacts when you're ready to do your ears yeah so would be unfair of me to say that it's it's augmented in that it's enhancing but I have enhanced it in ways that are particular to me but it's not some algorithm really determining things that I should hear and I am in total control of how that works and how it sounds I don't see the the case for augmented reality I just don't see it I mean Apple's Trinity with their glasses I think it's trying to get people from doing this to doing this is probably that's all that it is that's all that it is that it's also probably adding to the experience right if you can have like little animated fairies everywhere you go that you see through your Apple glasses everything else looks the same give to go to the Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland yes he knows it Go sitting right next to you that you see through your Apple glasses everything else looks the same people go to the Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland yes he knows it Go sitting right next to you if I see you in one of those glasses on head</div>

something like that you have the perception that people have ultimate success and ultimate happiness is it seems motivated by what they don't have rather than an understanding of what success and happiness really is there their ideas at one day I'm going to go and I'm going to be in my golden years and I'm just going to be able to sit around and do nothing and tell everybody to you will be happy at all I talked to one of the people that I was working with a vision for retirement you'll be dead this like pathetic sunburned like fat cirrhotic dehydrated how long can you have a margarita on a beach like maybe you can do that once every 6 months for like 10 minutes something like that it's true but when you are working and slaving away think about that beach with your feet up and and the waiter comes over would you like another margarita mix to Peter Singer like this sixteen-year-old fantasy of paradise and it just doesn't work out really is the lifting of a worthwhile burden it's something like that because we're social animals right to be useful to the people around us because they're much more likely to let us live if we're like that it's been very fun talking to especially talking to young men about this is like well enough the other thing to is I think the world the world is full of Darkness let's say and we could say each of us have a little bit of light and if it we released that light if we let it shine properly Christ it's too cliche to go on with him some sense but the world is a lesser place if you do not reveal from within yourself what you have to reveal and the fact that the world is a lesser place turns out not to be trivial like if you wanted everything you could be more people will die more people will suffer more evil will be unconstrained more tyranny will rain more chaos will remain chaotic and dangerous all of that like the old proverb of the wings of a butterfly fluttering become a hurricane messed up then you are got your act together like 10% more your family would be 1% better than what the hell difference does it make what you do anyways like that is not how we're connected like you're the center of a network and well you know way more people than this but let's say typically you know without going to a thousand people in your life well enough to have an impact on them okay I need to know a thousand people is going to know

should do it better than you think and so you think well clean up your room so I call your room is actually Network to it's not that easy to clean up your room to set it so you want your room to be set up so that when you walk in there it tells you to be better than you generally are it's organized it's got Direction everything's in its place you try to do that in a chaotic household look clean up your room and just write down what happens as a con so maybe these are students in a chaotic household the whole place is a bloody mess noise taking responsibility for anything so they decide they're going to start to clean up the room and then the people in the household notice of the first thing to do is get pissed off so I can do you think you are like you think you're better than us like why do you think this is worthwhile Who Made Who died and made you God all of that so just by trying to organize this little part of their life they immediately run into the people whose actions their calf in a dim light by trying to improve themselves to some degree they might have to have like a throw war in their household to be allowed to do something as simple as keep a room or Julie if find out very rapidly that a that's way more difficult than it sounds and be that the consequences of it are far more far-reaching than people think that's quite fun maybe part of it is this little Rat Hole of a room in some run-down place in the world it's like fix it up there's more than you think see what happens if you fix it up and you'll fix yourself up simultaneously cuz you have to get disciplined in order to fix up the room then you have a fixed up room and you'll be a more fixed up person that's like you think that nothing will happen as a consequence of that like all hell will break loose as a consequence of that well people don't take what they have right in front of them seriously enough it's like the wasting time thing they don't do the arithmetic you know when they'd also don't understand they devalue what they have right in front of them like another another client I worked with was having a hard time putting his kid to bed at night and so we did the arithmetics like while I'm fighting with my kid for 45 minutes tonight trying to get him to go to bed okay so let's analyze that alright so what does that mean that's not so good cuz why would you want that it means that you're spending 45 minutes fighting when you could spend 20 minutes doing something positive like reading to him say means that you don't get to spend that time with your wife so she's not very happy with you plus you're annoyed because you don't see her plus you blame it on the kid because he's the proximal cause like that's pretty damn ugly and then and then let's do the arithmetic days a week 45 minutes a day let's call that 5 hours 20 hours a week 240 hours in a year you're spending a month-and-a-half of work weeks fighting with your four-year-old son think you're going to like them you don't like anyone you spend a month-and-a-half a year fighting with it's a bad idea fix it it's important get him to bed make it peaceful you do it it like these things that repeat every single day that's a motif in this book to your life isn't Margaritas on a beach in in Jamaica that happens now in that those are exceptions your life is how your wife greets you at the door you come home everyday cuz that's like 10 minutes a day your life is how you treat each other over the breakfast table cuz that's an hour and a half for an hour every single day you get those mundane things right those things you do everyday if concentrate on them and you make them pristine it's like you got 80% of your life put together these little things that are right in front of us they're not little that's the first thing they are not little and they're hard to sit right and if you set the right it has a Rippling effect and end concentrated lemon you make them pristine it's like you got 80% of your life put together these little things that are right in front of us they're not little that's the first thing they are not little and they're hard to sit right and if you set the right it has a Rippling effect and end fast to way faster than people think</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you know music industry stuff I think I've been working really hard to go against the grain of like right now I'm self-released like I don't have a record company and I'm self-funded and it's really hard but it's also really gratifying at the same time because you know right now I since I left honey honey you know like honey honey kind of on ice for you sort of yeah well we were figuring it out you know well said but you know that the battle is getting head you know and and being a woman and envying in my 30s and and not like you know no one wants to hop on board until they know it's working even though I made this incredible wreck and it's so well-received and then folks are like yeah woke you know calls when it's when it's working rather than like get in now and you know I feel I don't feel discouraged by that I feel informed but that that's also a business move you know because it is we're taking art and turning it into Commerce and no one wants to bet on a horse that's not winning yet you know and you know I'm pretty I feel pretty good about what I'm doing I don't think I should be doing something else but it's still struggle you know so when I said I want to change the narrative it's it's sort of like I wanted kind of prove to myself and others that like you can do it like you find a way you know and it's it's really hard but you can do it you know when you get help from your friends like this is so cool to be here with you guys like I don't know if I could really convey that enough that this is a huge help to what I'm trying to do right now but yeah also this is the thing that keeps me up at night feeling like oh my God but at the same time you know the music industry I'll just speak to that right now it's tough was it seems to me if it's a big ship that had to like cut parts of itself off and now it's a small warship now it's like whoa it's still a pretty big ship but it's not what it used to be that the money doesn't come in anymore in the form of record sales so it's it's entrenched its tentacles deeper into the industry and other things like merchandise and live shows and all these different things to stay alive and maybe it helps yeah maybe it depends what you're doing at your point in your life we like to look this isn't f****** working like what what do I need to do like being attached to this group is not doing it being a group what's the fox doing it let me just try to not be attached to someone through the internet you have the option to put your stuff out there I know it's hard but it's all so yeah like you know I want to capture that thing I want to get into the right tune into the right radio station and also not have to worry so much about like not having enough to get by you know that kind of thing and it sounds silly but it's not like that's that is my reality what is the major function of a record label Venus early selling records so they are get to the event and set everything up and then then they would reap some of the reward so it's almost like an initial investment and then based on return from tickets at ride so it's expensive to be out on the people you know and that's the thing is like people coming to this thing, I made it I've got this this deal with it your record doesn't hit or never doesn't hit then they've invested all this money so it's kind of it puts his extra pressure on you to figure out what you need to do to make it and I think some people go down a different router with change up switch up their thing and they can be very helpful a lot of it is your attitude and what you think of like you are you being taken advantage of her sitting up and down you know depending on how to match will be hard to be free and creative and having a good time with it if you feel like you're being taken advantage of it put a dark cloud over where you think all of a sudden like you have to stop doing something and they're going to do for you that is like the biggest mistake you could ever make it in and if anything you have to work harder and prove to them that like your kind of worthy of their time and money you know sometimes it depends it depends on the company but they have a lot of your creative integrity and in some ways depending on the deal and how it shaped and you know on your copyright if they want it on your record depending on your deal sometimes you have more leverage than others and you know if that's the case like f*** yeah good for you self-release my last record ruby red and I learned a lot because I heard my own PR and distribution companies and I really got into the nuts and bolts on how all this s*** works and I'm not sure if this is change cuz sometimes this is no going back and forth but when you own your copyright the digital return on things like Spotify and iTunes are ten-to-one so when the record companies on your copyright and all of your streaming is is kicking I just f****** taking off their making tons of money on your pregnant it's like it's weird turn off but I have a feeling if you just look at the landscape that that is less and less of an issue with almost every year they have a distribution over the Internet just threw people finding out about it and sharing it tossing it around as probably as useful if not better than anything I'll find out about it podcast find out about it people on Twitter find out about it the retweet Sheffield Instagram repost off and then it hits millions and millions and millions and millions of people 100% organic happens all the time which is good it's almost like your your bank rolling on it not being a good idea if you do it with somebody else like what you're doing is like bankrolling and shelf do the label you have to so many people have to be in nothing wrong with it me I'm sure it's worked out great for both you and a numerous occasion to believe in you have to work with someone there's a lot involved not the case and you know people's jobs depend on your success and if they're scared and they go in and this in this way that it's not like it doesn't hit or something like they drop you fast and I'll speak is that is a perfect example yes imagine you are trying to keep a different stretches business goats of all time, I mean he's he was in before it was with high heels cuz it was so good I think about all the homophobe we were talking about transphobia homophobia 1888 or whatever the f*** it is when he put out their first album and it didn't matter any everybody was so good everybody just had to step the

		<div class="paragraph"> y'all deviate but what I don't want to do I don't want to work out brand new material for 3,000 people one night at the store and this was a year ago and you had to Jet right after the second go to Pasadena for another set me on my buddy that I brought with me we just like we're going to hang here so you comes out in like Jeff Ross with somebody comes out and he's doing his bit and right in the middle of it the back curtain opens in Chappell walks out and just kind of like Taps Ross on the I got this you know and just Jack the mic and pretty much everybody else's set who was supposed to perform that night and stands are for like 3 hours man just sitting there I will probably never happen again I'm not f****** leaving and we just sat there the whole time he said they're rocking tequila bombs and getting drunk and just really talk in there was times where was the funniest thing I've ever seen literally and there were times really good kind of got dark and you're like words with the fox happening or is this going and he was working and then later on those Netflix specials land and I realize I've already heard like 90% of these jokes and cuz the guys just going to go hijacked the main room work my s*** out cuz I got it like that on Dave Chappelle you know what is f****** amazing yeah he does that a lot will he'll just drop into place and just do a set and that's that's how he kind of works his material out you know he just kind of drops in and keeps tweaking it and it's it's if he has a structure right like if he has a few ideas he's talking about he can just rip and Specialty drink and just go on stage and then freaking and there's always got dudes behind them that are taking down notes letting them know like all you talked about this day and I'm sure they record it to go over it and eventually boil it down to like what that Netflix special was the to Netflix specials in a year later put out to Netflix just want this month and I'd like to put it down for all eternity are you cool with that most people like you write something and it's a good solid year before you even consider putting in a special you know some guys were doing like a special year but too much it was like half-cooked like if you just waited six more months this thing would be like an all-time great special instead you're banging them out once a year you never get the essence of the thing with his thing to part of his thing making it look like it's so easy realistic cuz they had a night at the county store just like it did feel like he was just sort of making the s*** up on the spot and then you see the Netflix specials and it sort of feels the same way like he's just being Dave and Becky with little subtle things I noticed like probably 10 times throughout the night at really awkward moments he would call the waitress to get him another drink but he would he would only say bar horror and every time you say it it get a little a little more like a little less appropriate each and every f****** town were probably get to eventually everybody the room is like that's not really cool Shelby Renee Todd Fillmore doesn't even he'll do that but that's booked he books that you have to build that shitt not like he'll work at a comedy club in just show up. I was in Denver once the green room after the show it was after the late show Friday night I went backstage and days of The Green Room back in people ready getting up and leaving I said date ladies gentlemen get back their spells here and we just flew in and I see him and then he does but his creative process is like almost like engineered around being loose like doing whatever he wants going where he wants to go do whatever he wants and then writing you know and then figured out on stage than Redfin and then just f****** around fascinating fascinating to watch slick Jazz almost yeah that's what Dave Chappelle wants to do that's the key I think that's the key if we can all be in the business of whoever the f*** you are whatever you do well is I like the right songs and make records and pretty much say no to everything else does what Dave Chappelle wants to do that's the key extinct think that's the key if we can all be in the business of where the f*** you are whatever you do well is I like to write songs and make records and pretty much say no to everything else</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> yeah I was just texting him the other day maybe real hopeful he keeps doing what he's doing cuz if that guy runs for president right they can have those f****** Giants peaches and that's one of the reasons why Trump is successful is his ability to stand in front of large groups of people and get big reaction that's what Trump is Trump's too, cuz that nothing but shity, Sabah form so all the politicians the form of even the most interesting was a really boring to listen talk to for long periods of time but Trump goes up there and it makes fun of Mike Bloomberg height by ducking under the fucken table and any calls Hillary went crazy her lying Hillary and sleepy Joe Biden makes jokes about them I'm not saying I'm not justifying what he does but the reason why he can't even do what he does besides him when it comes to communicating is so goddamn boring their messages so f****** boring something to wear the mask killer Mike is no mask he's guns-blazing oh yeah that kind of person is the future call a man that's what's going to happen with back to the jumping weird weird like sculpted fake scripted reality Trump is the antidote to that that's the problem they're all crazy to that might be the worst kind of crazy it's a broken system does nonsense nonsense people do for you it's like someone description of it. it is harmless and they just fans and they wanted to be like him they might not even realize they're doing it and eventually find their own voice with musicians and having probably with everybody in in are in everything right but the problem is doing something like that is like I can't listen you can't run the world if you're doing a character for doing this as you're trying to make it as a comic and you pretend you're Dave Attell fine but you want to run the f****** free didn't you do any Obama thing and you talking like this and you talking exactly exactly Ciroc Obama you're right that's what they all are almost every one of them</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> did you get a chance that beer thing that would be cool to tell people I can really really yeah I guess so a lot of other things so it's like yeah you all day at four squares but my dear landlord friend invited me downstairs to play this game that was created by the Rich Dad Poor Dad author and I can't is it called suck my dick suck my dick it's about it's a financial game it's like an adult Monopoly because you're kind of like buying property and then you're like making deals and there's something about it that why did you read Rich Dad Poor Dad it's an interesting way to approach a relationship with money if you've ever struggled with it or weren't sort of given a crash course on how to handle it or not handle it with you know in a way that you can live a healthier life and you know not obviously in a can Society like you kind of have this constant like I need I need anything out of that stuff but Rich Dad Poor Dad first of all I read the book I didn't read the whole book so I can't really like a speak on the entirety of it but it gave me a different level of confidence that money was taken from me you know like the work as an artist like I chose the life to be a musician I could have lived in Cleveland and sold spaghetti and had a comfortable life and this is my family has a great a great restaurant if that ship has sailed cuz it's like out of my immediate family has hands but at the time I have had many many moments in my life where I was like should I move home and just like ditch this music thing because that would be so much easier and Money's been like this you know you kind of have I had a roller coaster and it can like roll my sleep and Rule my happiness in mind but when I read Rich Dad Poor Dad and then in conjunction with this board game I played with Russell it really it's so funny it it seems you know what it seems like part of the whole illusion of reality and obviously you need money to survive but the the stock that we put into it is pretty incredible you know things that we think that we need in order to to like yes yes and I feel like there's this weird mine came I'm always playing with it like in in terms of like getting to the next level of my music career like it's going to take this much how you going to get it in all that stuff but at the end of the day I think when you sort of like release your White Knuckles on on the thing it all works itself out I know that sounds pretty you know broad but I think of money is Tangled in the Life what you currently can do right based on your circumstances are facing your life your health your responsibilities there's what you can do and is what what's like what's humanly possible for and when you see people that are making a lot of money and you see that money the money source is it get you thinking that's what you should do you should do that money thing whatever that money is used to make less money now I make more money and that makes more money than even I make I got to do what that is to get more money but then you do that this isn't fun and I most of my day is spent doing something that's not enjoyable that's not what I want to do what you want to do what you can do with the possible and which one and they don't always go together sometimes what you can do is like you have too much responsibilities in your you are always going to feel the short-sighted by life because it's random and it's craziness chaos but the money thing can trick it like if you have a certain amount of money in the bank like Brian counted the best of me so once you go to restaurant and don't worry about what food cost because everything else is b******* you know your gas is paid your car payment paid you not worried about it at all you can just go eat let's go eat at tip thank you goodnight by that's when that's when you're rich everything other than that is like what are you doing cuz you just trying to score points cuz that's what we do and try to get the high score to get the high score I just just passed Pawn super old school door ship that's funny but that's what it's like you know always because you're more relaxed if you more relaxed you're better if you better you attract people that want to do stuff with you for people anxious people are the worst angry people because of the angry that they've been f***** over by the system somehow and I know how hard I work in like trying to get the things that I really want I don't feel dated or or you know cynical about it I feel really excited gigantic is going to be really romantic me and Brad Pitt just funky become gigantic is going to be really romantic me and Brad Pitt just funky doing the best you can do is hope</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> vat19 I'm in this Comedy Club Greenville, some black room Chappelle is on stage and he's getting booed and his Dismount off getting booed is something I've never seen before in my life it was fantastic he's like f*** y'all I'm going to be famous chance in comedy because he walked by nobody wanted to touch him cuz he had that that that that bomb on them to even say hey man the stages of iMac you thinking why doesn't he leave and he's sitting there and Tony what's goes on stage next and Tony was like wow man goddamn like just kind of a similar Cadence and Tony just destroy got a standing ovation like night and day and I was just 19 new like absorbing this I mean like I think I'm 5-7 but I'm stuck in a 6-5 but I'm just turning like looking what they going to do next and they get up together and they walk out I kind of just follow him out thinking I don't know what's going to happen even hey kids when they get in the same car and and lot longer and I knew that Dave that's kind of like how when Kobe came into the league and was talking like Mike and then Kobe Lena tahuko be separate from Tony but what I love about what they did in this is why he's great is he had he recognized Tony in his greatest like heated moment I guess the most honest thing you can do you don't even most people like I did this on me but he was like and what he said about when he could not have been true or you know what I mean and so it just like touched my heart cuz I was I was there at the epicenter when I was watching Dave figure it out so that we can get through to the point where we have kids before we talk guy and functionally downhill when I mentally or physically but after that Eeveelution doesn't care about us anymore and therefore we are only equipped to write that much terms of their ability to recover from the damage of just regular everyday life and exercise and abuse and running around back to the difference between a younger person and older person to let me answer that question by stepping back one step from one day to the next even stopping before with boa and those changes every time using the word damage to describe changes is because eventually things don't work so well so you're quite right that recovery from injury is one thing that doesn't work so well but plenty of other things the amount by which they become less good it's pretty negligible until the age of 40 or 50 it's on the decline start to acceler-ice so what do you do in your own life to try to mitigate that acceleration I'm already bad example sausage bake off and you know I'm fat by look younger than I actually am chronologically how old you chronologically the amount that is more than the damage I'm doing Myself by for example not getting enough sleep like using a black to car three runs everywhere like it's beating his wife as a car and he doesn't buy a car isn't he's not spending any of that money but he's he's the real deal like he's not posing that's that guy all day long 24 hours a day you know when he's honest about every step of the way. f*** you b**** you got to run run motherfuker because then once I run then I feel it because I get mad at myself for not wanting to run earlier so I run more like he's honest about like his vulnerabilities in his weakness is honest about who he is but it's also there's no no question he's going to get everything done like he's a complex individual and I think because of the fact that he's so honest about all that stuff tell me more intriguing like he's honest like all the pictures of him when he was drinking milkshakes near 300 lb and he loves showing those two people that was me that was me as a fat f*** I was a fat f*** I was lazy the first time he thinks everybody has that in them do you think everybody not to that degree it depends me everybody has that in them if you choose to act the way he acts but a lot of that book is insane and you learn cuz I read the book as well you learn from that book in the audiobook a book I would actually recommend Elizabeth because in between chapters he talks about all the different things that happened and actually elaborates in the immortal tense of whale makes you holy s*** like his life was hell his father was a monster and he did not have a happy childhood by any stretch of the imagination was horrible it was he it was filled with torture and racism and strife and struggle and he felt sorry for himself and his terrible but all those demons now he has those motherfukers locked up pushing the wheel you know that Iron Wheel at Coney for him now those aren't they work for him what was your first deployment like so my first one was with that why we're doing submersible work so I drove like a 22-foot mini-sub for 5 years real waterborne activities and Let It Go like you're in the water. Just underwater oh really yeah so you're wearing scuba gear while you're piloting the oven so the water gets in there yep well you can probably pull up a picture of it bro that's mine f*** off top of a mind for fpv just being in the scuba is crazy but being a scuba gear inside of a f****** submarine with the door shut that's what it looks like she is now that's nuts and I was so it's like a convertible behind those dudes the doors sliders if you have them open like s*** to be like James Bond movie landing on the back of a submarine is 22 ft long whatever call first world war submarines and they had a window that look like for back to your question how much hair do we got enough friends when they got to the bottom actually get down there and then anything like back to your question how much hair do we got oh my God I guess we have enough oh my God</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> mitigate when you go overseas the effect of being over there too long because I would I would imagine that the stress of constant combat first so this is my ignorance of it but this is what I would think is that what happens first is probably like you get better at being calm and more accustomed to it but after a while the pressure eventually starts to crack you that it did just many many many months over there dealing with it do you have to decompress you do and they have like decompression windows at the end of deployments how much that would it look with a typical deployment how long does it last so I was over there for 4 months and they do everything front but they've done everything from 3 months to 13 plus for Special Operations guys and the reason being they do the shorter ones because of the operation Tempo you're doing so much and you're doing it so quickly and they want you to be freshly watch be good at it because they don't want that stressed out what is that like this distress I quit. How does it affect people because I mean I would assume the affects everyone differently no but the but the process of being In Harm's Way consistently for a long-term I joke about it making everybody professionally paranoid like you're always like I'm not always wound up but I'm always on some sort of alert for things you know I'm always thinking about stuff I'm always quitanda II NYC doing that right in a way that I don't I don't know why that's there I mean I know why but I don't know what part of my brain is saying what the f*** is that car done is that hard to let go and civilian life or is it just there forever and I think it's there are forever I can't I don't know if it's still there Jersey jackals video a video recently where he's like people who sing why you looking over your shoulder some checking my flanks like what why you was in the dark he goes so the enemy can't see me how come you don't smile I want them to see my teeth that guy he's both a brilliant guy who is wise and humble and but also f****** gorilla yeah he's a little legit Savage ya had the chance to roll a little bit with him.

		<div class="paragraph"> what are you telling them to think of when you're telling them like reteaching combat pistols you teach him how to utilize a pistol what do you what what is the process of like I try and break stuff down as simple as possible so that it's easy steps for people to talk through to create a habit so that you're using it as a subconscious effort right like I want you to be able to draw and fire that pistol or shoulder and fire the rifle the way that you're almost not thinking through once you become very proficient at the shooting so that your brain can stay open to all the other pertinent s*** that's going on all the scary crap is happening out there right so it becomes an automatic movement you want it to be like that you want it to be an automatic movement and those guys out there with a ton more combat time in a s*** ton more teaching experience that say the exact same thing and they say it because it works because there's not time to screw around with having to think through the process it's similar to how your drawing a Bone hunting right to time to really think through it all now an animal walking out in front of you had that stuff simple and we can only handle so much information so I'll break it down feed you more pieces individually as they come up now how much in the military how much time do they spend instructing or coaching people on how to how to think during intense and stressful situations so they they started to do more of that when I was in buds does a fairly recent thing relatively recent and I know they do more now and what they're trying to do is get people to make sure that they can understand what they're doing and perform under the pressure right and a lot of it a lot of the training and a lot of the selection weeds out people that can't put stress and information into the same Lane of traffic you can always lose it so what they're what they're saying is it's all processed but they've been there weeding people out that can't handle that sort of shed and so does this something that they've written books on or their manuals on this and or is this just something that's understood no not remember that pinging us on this for me when I was in like psychological stuff we did have some guys come in and talk to us and then you know I don't particularly remember exactly what the advice was like word for word but I do remember it being like follow your training and overtraining you the right way and it's not to do as you're told is do what you know how to do and you'll do it well and is a lot of being able to perform in combat in these situations that are insanely stressful and give them information stress the same time is a lot of that just learned by experience I think so what was it like for you being overseas organic process yeah I was one of the guys there cuz I was augmenting meaning I was an extra person I volunteered to go ask to go so I was open ears open eyes and closed mouth for 4 months like these dudes that are over there have been had been doing it for a long time at that point cuz I was there in 2011 and 12 and it's all a process that is fatally consequential and I knew that so you're like I'm just going to shut up and f****** listen or shut up and watch those wise it's f****** terrifying is why it's not necessarily being wise like you're just I don't want to die stepping over there for a reason you know he's not leaning against that wall for reason he's doing this for a reason he's got his gear setup like that for it's not for fun you know they're not over the airsofting it's f****** for real so yes questions and the best thing that I've been able to get from the teams which was super evident there is you learn how to learn you know you learn how to be a student a good one cuz if you're not learn how to learn don't you learn how to be a student a good one cuz if you're not there's a good chance you could die a lot of guys have died overseas and a lot of guys have died in training still doing the right thing</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> so much mental management involved in that that's why it when guys like Jocko come along and they can take that understanding of leadership and mental management and and then teach it to other people. Teach it to corporations and teach it to groups and law enforcement and people that need that sort of understanding that's coming from a guy like him with the immense amount of experience that he has in a couple different genres that allow him to den teach that in a way that is comprehendible and super-efficient it seems to me that that would be one of the most important parts of that of that job about how to handle deployment how to handle coming back and do the mental aspect of it yeah you learn it from other guys like I think so I think it's just a I honestly think a lot of it is that process weeds out so many dudes it would be the the ticking time bomb or the guy that can't handle it by the time we're training for this stuff and it's super stressful everybody's pretty much on on their s*** you know and then there's like little stuff that you learn while you're doing shooting that you can transfer to all of it the breathing techniques right and then by and large we are so well-trained and know that we're so well-trained that you're just doing your damn job. Just do your job and do the best you can I'm not thinking about me necessarily as much as I'm thinking about everybody else also as fascinating to the training is so ruthless and brutal that it weeds out people can handle s*** f****** works then we doing it basically the same way since the sixties but hasn't there been some chit-chat about alleviating the standards to let women pass through I've heard of it I've heard I've heard that they want to put females to the program but not to change the standards how many women have gone through buds 0 don't say that women are going to feel like you're a sexist you should lie I'm not sure I do not see GI Jane cuz she went through well yeah but she said they weren't allowed to I am not sure but I think that they're trying to make that a thing now trying I wonder how many women have attempted to go through buds Jimmy see if you can Google how many women have attempted to go through buds ladies listening to this please don't get uncomfortable just trying to figure it out do the same stuff that they're doing for that they're probably making sure she can make it through the program also they want to make sure this physically she can probably a pre-screen screen pre-screen they do that for officers to make women is it coming from women that want to do it or is it coming from politicians that want to sort of show that they have a diverse lineup politicians 1% because he was a deal I've meant more than enough females that are Apache Pilots fighter pilots badass UD chicks which is explosive Ordnance like Hurt Locker right bad women in the military they want no part of that job I could be a Navy SEAL and that's not they just don't want that job why is that you'd have to ask them about Navy Seals is that it's like recognized that these are the best of the best days of the most Savage human beings that we can create the most efficient the most effective the one that can handle the most the ones who can get the job done when the shed is is Harry as it gets yeah and Hawaii change the program just to diversify the lineup there's nothing that they want to show do that they're not sexist this is equal opportunity in the people that want to prove it are the ones that aren't in the ring yeah that's the problem right you're not getting this from the actual team itself to nothing chicks I'm sure it's the same I feel for those women cuz they're going to take a lot of s*** oh my God yeah but doesn't everybody takes s*** so like s*** s*** yeah for sure the first woman damn right they're going to be like well you didn't do it the same as everybody else does is it going to take a lot of s*** oh my God yeah but doesn't everybody takes it so like this extra s*** s*** yeah for sure the first woman damn right they're going to be like well you didn't do it the same as everybody else</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> Google talking about was the difference between the way the media depicts it and the way it is is there anybody that's it got it right is there any movie that you watch and go that's pretty goddamn close I don't know they're all fish you know but a lot of them are very hollywoodized they have to be it's just a story but I can say that Saving Private Ryan was super close obviously I wasn't for that but my dad's dad said he had to step out of the theater we went to go see that because he could smell diesel he remembered it it's that strong of a memory for him was he at Normandy know he cheated in the South Pacific with the that f****** opening scene when they are on the beach it's it's it's tough f****** nuts man the idea that that was the only way that they could handle that situation that they had to do it that way. Imagine being one of those guys enough to get out those boats that was there that was a good better best scenario it was something that someone did to commemorate the anniversary of the event and they did something that represented everybody of everyone who died did it like on the beach so I quit with the number haircuts 425000 Allied Insurance German troops were killed wounded or went missing during the Battle of Normandy Jesus Christ I mean I remember my Grandad has and he told me these things before I joined about stormy a beach in South Pacific and everybody left right front back at him dying going up the sand everywhere you look so that if you were a person who really had this abstract idea that this war went down there that gives you a visual representation what it must have looked like you can kind of almost get it in your head to get makes it more visceral yeah just look and see. Me f****** bodies in it that was the best case scenario for these guys that's the best-case scenario that's why they did it that way before I went to Afghanistan it's about a month is when exercise 17 happen I'm like f*** I'm going there to replace those guys it makes it really really like some something sound home really well and some things don't and for me that did something happened I'm like f*** I'm going there to replace those guys it makes it really really like some something sound home really well and some things don't and for me that did</div>

Cuz you are thinking all day while you watching the fights I wonder how much a burning cuz do when I get out of there I eat like a f****** Wolf Trap activity I don't I don't think it's going to know mental because I don't think your heart rate is jacked if there are burning 6000 calories a day just sitting at can I guess measure calories burned off of your physical and also mentally taxing I got done Dives that are 6 to 12 hours long and you got water and you'd like I'm sitting there like I'm using my brain a lot but it's also cool to f*** a couple times and lost 8 plus pounds wow in the water in the water in the water you can get dehydrated when immersed in water it says that polar that company that went to they tracked a chess champion 21 years old in October he burned 560 calories in two hours of sitting and playing chess about the same amount as Rodger Federer wood would burn in an hour of singles tennis an hour of an elliptical is about 5 6600 but I would feel like better or just hopping around all that plyos in East Bernard Hopkins efficient elevated sustained elevated blood pressure is the Pinnacle of things that you do that aren't physical in terms of movement but are incredibly calorie taxing one of those the number I mean that's a very complex game brain surgery go barely moving but your likes concentrating so hard for hours and hours at a time after it's over I'm so hungry and that has to be our 10 hour 15 minutes that's because you're thinking and our 10 hour 15 minutes that's because you're thinking and you're managing it while you're doing it is giant audience there are you got to be f****** OnPoint yeah that's but I think that you have seen makes me more hungry but it's also like 6 hours 7 hours in a day</div>

Makes sense well there's also a lot of guys whose hormones are out of whack you know from IDs and from blowing down doors I've been dumped enough where I can I felt my teeth in pretty sure you're not supposed to be able to feel your teeth Jesus Christ will so many guys who get back have hormone issues too because pituitary gland damage from chronic brain trauma I'm not surprised in that stuff that really needs to be addressed and that's the kind of stuff like you were saying for the charity for the traumatic brain injury that s*** that you see it looked at during preventive work yes ahead of time yes and then monitoring people making sure that they're okay cuz that stuff is degenerative and people need to know that that's out there and it can be helped is it hard sometimes for veterans to ask for help I think so because I just feel like maybe asking shows a weakness or maybe they just it just took too difficult to reach out think I think it's the too difficult to reach out and I don't want to be the problem or there must be guys that are worse than me I think it's usually Daddy Surly the the fully inflated ego of ganja could be a hard-ass but there is no that's out there but I think it's a lot of guys that are like now there's probably somebody worse to me so if you come home and you're not dramatically injured right we did Legs blown off her arm blown off you feel like you're lucky so you feel like you shouldn't be asking for help people need help more let me go find somebody else when veterans return is really disturbing like the idea that there's so much emphasis put into training is so much emphasis put into arming and making sure that everybody's geared up your multimillion-dollar machine yeah but then when you get back they don't have a use for anymore used tire now it's getting better and a lot of the outside groups do a really good job but it's tough to realize that there's outside groups that are doing that job yes or a lot of guys I put the FED doing right right thanks. It's almost like there's no pressure on them to resolve some of these issues or to help when you come back is there any coaching the date they give you any sort of they do so I didn't end up going to any of that and they always tell you hey if you need to talk to somebody there are people to talk to you and all the people that you talk to other psychologist or the cam Frances well they colleges which I think is a good thing it's a good thing to talk to psychologist I think so any of those guys veterans themselves there from my recollection they're all on the military on the military but are they all did they experience action I'm not sure I don't want to stay out like off hand without knowing for certain I didn't end up talking into them so I don't know do you like is this something that you discuss with team leaders or do you like guys have been you have deployed never turns it's like a common thing we go hey yo what's it like when you get back is it how it how hard is it to transition to normal everyday life and keep your s*** together and what are the tools that use to get high to maintain think unfortunately that's the stuff is getting talked about now just now more recently because so many cents are you like the fighters right do they ask each other how do you recover after a fight now it's how do you look for it didn't make sure you win cuz that's all we care about what we're looking at front end front end and action front end action front-end action how do I train how do I mitigate all the risk how do I make sure that my buddy isn't the one that's killed because I fuk up right right so if that's what we're concerned about what's going on how do I mitigate all the risk how do I make sure that my buddy isn't the one that killed because I f****** right right so if that's what we're concerned about nobody gives a crap about what's going on with back in because you just going to rinse wash repeat that cycle Bryant till you're done</div>

Healthcare there's a lot of things that are already socialist ideal that we use we just forgot about it like the fire department the fire department if you don't have a private fire department to put out your fire we pay for the fire department comes out of our taxes pay those those very brave men and women and then they, they put out your fire that's a socialist IDEA Public Schools are socialist ideas beliefs of socialists idea fixing of the road there's a lot of things that your money goes to the idea that you we can't extend that and to have a better life because of it and to have free healthcare and free college education and to eliminate student debt I don't know that that's incorrect I don't know that is wrong I just think it's a thing where our government to me and I'm no expert but it seems like they throw so much money away why not if you going to throw it away do something good with it Diaz and if they're right is revolutionary and that's what he thinks he thinks he can enact revolutionary changes free healthcare revolutionary win pretty much the whole not just the drug companies have but a lot of industry has on the way politicians decide how to spend you warm and that's what he says that's that's one of the things he's saying that makes people scared that's why the the Democrats are scared of him too because they're all getting paid as well but it's not like this is a republican thing only has an established institution thing but it also proves that like with Michael Bloomberg spending all this money that when he goes to Super Tuesday he's going to get 13% of their guesstimating about 13% it's just that he's going to pass up a lot of people that have been campaigning showed you how much money you don't even get play in in our politics by being on every 5 minutes for him strategy what will you do to post us they all that posting the conversation instead of what they're asking to post which that was such a strategy is like these weird strategies they have Think Tank spending millions of dollars to get that done thinking it's going to pass out loud to him whatever his thoughts are so really if they go against each other it's almost the same person I'm not talkin policies at all I'm just saying this characteristics you know we're not going to back down from trunk one where it's like you know let's just see I want to see who the Democratic person is in and then we all got to roll with him if you're on that side Bernie yeah I think it's going to be president because he's old get Elizabeth Warren has his age more dangerous than she is useful okay like I don't know her that well don't trust her after that whole Pocahontas s*** all that the Indian stuff for she said she was Native American and turns out she's like one one hundredth of a percent of whatever the f*** it is me and maybe maybe she would get the women on their side I think but she's also established Democrat money I think maybe more likely that he would get someone that we haven't heard of okay it's in very important as his vice president Mike Pence but I'm saying because it's old because he's only had the heart problem you know the vice president is more important than making Obama vice president Pence same sort of renegade philosophy politics but you know Prairie winds when you go to White House is just as pretty boy right here cuz I want to go to White House with you about the last brouhaha after you put that video up and everybody got upset he'll have you I think what's going to happen is we're going to see that regular Politics the way they've been practiced for all these years in this country with like these two bulshit choices are going to go away and I think it's going to be harder and harder for a stye been practiced for all these years in this country with like these two bulshit choices are going to go away and I think it's going to be harder and harder for established people whether it's Republican or Democrat to keep doing that song and dance and having people buy it and that's a good thing it's a good thing</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I want to ask you about this maybe I'll talk with the Dante Wilder excuse he came out with yet today what are you unfortunate do you do you think is there any validity to that if there's look so it's about 55 lb and I go hiking and after I could still do whatever the f*** I want and I'm just chill Rogan Deontay Wilder with a 40 lb outfit on that he killed his legs walking to the ring that's crazy talk I don't understand why you would say that I mean maybe it's true if it's true he said he had it all like 20 minutes before 15 minutes before he went out expert or anything so I just don't know if there's for the letter t in it and I f*** would let him put that on if that was that heavy it was 40 lb if it got to the point where it actually wore his body out as he's walking to the ring what he tried it on the night before they said and he liked it so he's like I'm aware it what makes the decisions the real big thing happened in the third round on Tyson Fury he he put that job in his face and hit him with that beautiful overhand right running the ear and dropped him equilibrium went off after that it does that cause 100% he was bleeding out of his and when that happens you don't know stand upright your body's all wacky it's not moving correctly that's what it looks like with him and that's what I was saying what I was watching it I was like his equilibrium is off until this is what's going on then eventually the commentator said it as well but there is his legs weren't under him but also he's getting bombed on Tyson Fury was hanging on him he would wrap his arm around his head and lean on him with a 270 lb he's carrying all that s*** to like and Tyson did something that had never been done before and then he bullied Deontay Wilder he got on and he came in the heavy and a lot of people thought he came into heavy but I think one of the reasons why I came in heavy is this is part of the strategy he went to what's up you got some did not have a broken eardrum apparently a minor laceration to his ear Wilder did not have a broken jaw some aspect of ignored you have a broken eardrum get a 2 centimeter cut on his ear that took seven stitches to close defeat the fewer was the first of all his professional career that interests so even though he didn't have a ruptured eardrum he still took a significant shot to the ear which often times f**** up your equilibrium and any shots to the temple to the ear a lot times at Fox up your balance but the key got bombed on Tyson Fury figure something out in the first fight that in the 12th round Deontay did not like it when he came after him so it doesn't fight well backing up so he's awkward on his feet and instead of letting Deonte come to him and he was boxing like he did for most of the first fight he fought the second fight the wave ottoman II in the 12th round Hitler right hand and he bully the bully you know and you know I don't mean deontez of Billy like in a bad way I mean he's like his style is he's very aggressive he's one of those ruthless punching knockout artists in the histories for not the number one I mean the guy has 42 Knockouts which is insane like his ass 4140 I think he's got 41 Knockouts 42 wins one by decision and one draw now has one loss Tyson had last Tyson went to decision with a lot of people hookah one of the greats and obviously a brutal knockout artist but Deontay Wilder has that touch of death it's crazy when he dropped Tyson Fury twice in their first fight and the 12th round looks like he was f***** but do you think they should have stopped it earlier I think it's better for his life and career that he wasn't going to come back I don't think it's going to come back he's getting f***** up if you're not going to stop punching him in the head either he's going to keep doing it Tyson was pure and clean and literally unharmed and looked fantastic to me and he been hit a couple of times but no problems down there was nothing that rocked him nothing that hurt him you know a few punches bounced off of them but he was put it on Deontay Wilder Amy he was putting it on them if that is true that he had it on for 20 minutes and then it really wore him out that's that's exceptionally silly on the part of his management to allow that to happen that someone didn't see that is Trainor didn't see that it didn't recognize that that was going to be a big problem calculator I think you just threw it on the night before and goes I feel good didn't really think I'm going to be in this thing for closest 35 minutes before I get on here 20 minutes then the walk-up is like 3 or 4 minutes and then you'd walk into the ring where he couldn't recover maybe it's the only the only comparison I have it like I said I know nothing about boxing but if I hope my son is 35 pounds I'll hold him for like 10 minutes I'm tired but I'm not a professional boxer I mean if I pick that thing up and I was just his train our big hey hey hey feel this now think about how long you don't have the song f*** this but just go out there normally guaranteed next time seems going to be dressed like Tyson that was so intimidating what am I signed up for it when I read this book and I interviewed he was scared but everybody's had Tyson Fury fights in that same way and stays on him can he beat that Tyson Fury vs Tyson Fury just boxes Faceoff who if it when this does have it who who would you pick out the gate on this one Deonte knocking down twice but now the knock him down in the 12th round but Tyson Fury came back and won the remainder of that round so you can almost give that round a draw and then the other round when he knocked him down you got to give the Deontay Wilder remaining 10 rounds are not in dispute remaining 10 Rounds went to Tyson Fury so if you just look at it on paper he should one that fight although most people weren't upset with the decision because Diante almost had him out and it's like it's exciting let's do a rematch no big deal but then in the rematch Tyson Fury just took the judges out of the f****** equation bombed on them it's really unfortunate that there is a question of whether or not that big stupid was wearing his legs out cuz if that really is the case that bums me out man he said he had on 20 minutes before the fight had to do the walk up had to get in the ring and it took it off he knew that was a game-changer Deontay Wilder fight has flatlined every single opponent he's faced except for Tyson Fury Stiverne he didn't flat bottom in the first place beaten by decisions beat the s*** out of them but the second fight you f****** mercum so he was probably thinking he can Mark anybody the way he did with Luis Ortiz same thing the first fight had a tough first fight with him second fight Mark some with one punch I think he just had this thing in his head that that's what he does and he's going to do that to Tyson Fury 2 and he never believe it Tyson Fury was actually in a fight that way there's going to jump on them the third one while they were talking about him fighting Anthony Joshua Tyson Fury find Anthony Joshua first and if that does happen I think he beats Anthony Joshua I think Tyson Fury is the best heavyweight on Earth I do and I think the only person that could beat him is probably Wilder if Wilder can recreate the success of the first fight and catch him I remember stop boxing or after I kind of lost a lot of interest in it because I grew up with like Sugar Ray Tommy Hearns and Marvelous Marvin Hagler and I felt like I don't see fights like that anymore they're possible today I mean that used to seem all the amazing fight anytime Terence Crawford fights in I love that guy Errol Spence Jr vassili lomachenko miss a great time for boxing is it really great prom 2006 now heavyweight to great time for boxing before you crouch jumps on me like I don't know anything about boxing so I'm not saying anything cuz I know some stuff about boxing cuz I'm a fan but it's not like anime like if someone wants to talk to me about MMA I can give you very educated you know opinions on things and I can I have some opinion but you know his other people are better at it it's a good time though I like it I'll get into it then I'll get into it again man third-round I screamed everyone in my house is like what the f*** is going on I know it's I think they should have stopped it in the fifth or sixth I could have done that to yeah but he's Deontay Wilder any of this look in his eyes like what just happened that is hit by God lightning bolt those through the lightning bolt by the sky like people can't believe how hard he is but the key to Tyson Fury's victories he didn't let him hit him just jumped on them and Tyson Fury other Unique Style like that big motherfuker he's 6-9 he's so big and so long such a character has jerked off 7 times a day to build his testosterone do you see that and go see me Usain Gypsy Lube he's got his own Lube

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> somebody sent me why would I tell you how much everything is going to cost Trump the personality overshadowed everything else his personality overshadowed all the shortcomings so because of the fact that he could say things like when he's talking about China you know you could go to China and you've received a video which one was that explains the China or you could say listen motherfukers think about who Obama was right Obama this like articulate Statesman who you were proud that that was the representative of America spoke so well you so measured so educated Donald Trump is not that do you feel that some American people since Obama was like that felt like he was speaking down to them for sure okay I don't either but some people get upset about that he doesn't speak his mind he doesn't say what he wants to say I don't like him because he's a liberal to some people don't like that cuz he's black to some people that don't like him because he's young some people don't like him cuz he went to Harvard. Listen to this illicit play this cuz this is one of my favorite Trump speeches and somebody that is really the messenger the messenger is important I could have one man saying when did attached to 25% and I could say another listen to motherfukers he's dumb he's not dumb he's just not concentrating on the things that intelligent people concentrate on the great literary Works he's talking about not talk about great philosophers are great historians these are not things he's concentrating on his whole life he has a sharp mine but his whole life he's been caught trading on Donald Trump and Donald Trump kicking ass and Donald Trump's name and Donald Trump's ego and feeling that ego and cheating at golf and doing all the things that he wants to do whatever he wants to do that's be concentrating on it doesn't mean that he's dumb and that's what people get distracted that they get confused I agree with you on that but but I what I'm surprised about what I'm surprised about is some people believe he's doing things for the country's best interest not for his own well he's definitely do things for his best interest and also probably doing things that he thinks are for the country's best interest as well I don't think all of what he's doing is just for him cuz you wouldn't be president if you did that doesn't make any sense cuz the beating that you take in terms of light well that's also your ego boost 73 years old right when you're that old you don't change you know you're not going I mean that the way you runs companies to expect him to do any different once it became president it's kind of silly but that's how he's become successful I mean that's why it's f****** name is on his giant buildings all over the world right it's like it's this ego thing and the way he does business I'm the f****** bought listen you motherfukers going to 25% that's his attitude. attempt to do any different once he became president is kind of silly but that's how he's become successful I mean that's why is f****** name is on his giant buildings all over the world right it's like it's this ego thing and the way he does business on the f****** boss listen you motherfukers been attached to 25% that's his attitude that's just thought</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> if you if you are convicted going to jail son and that's just a New York he still has to get tried out here that's just one have you seen how much he is aged in the last month like me and my wife were watching them on the news last night we go a couple years I told my wife that because you're going to die in jail when he's probably depressed so deeply imagine going from being the toast of the Town posing with Oprah top of the world doing the red-carpet everybody loves you everybody thanks you when they get their Academy Award committee overseeing the compilation of all the stars thinking Harvey without him accuse him later of being a monster but meanwhile they're just praising it don't you I don't know I guess. But it ain't about this yesterday I once was and I were talking about this yesterday we were on the podcast we're talking about like how much I'm so happy I don't have to go on a ditions and I don't act and I'm not I don't want to be a part of that anymore does one of them when people think a guy why is everybody Hollywood so fake because they're all trying to get cast in something is true they're all trying to get accepted by producers and casting directors and and Executives and so they're all just hedging their bets like planted like a guy on the first date just a b******* artist just to look up f****** slick guy with loose morals and a first date trying real hard as it was just him getting arrested and how long ago was that was his f****** Walker looking perfect when you like if someone's I guess if you because him and he can run away if you mess with any kids old video apparently. So he doesn't look like that anymore that's probably two or three years ago I told him he looks that was one of things that the court artist there was an artist that Drew him throughout the case and she was saying that you could see his deterioration is physical deterioration over the course of the trial have you seen him lately he looks 20 I wonder if that Walker shoots real you think it was I don't think it's real but I think it became real that's right I think we're old let's play it for the court and then he just got so broken down through the process what she deserved and it just took a toll on a man like Adam the video you just showed us like two years old May 2018 until now has lost most of his hair looks so old and tired from not getting any sleep his f****** beating man and he was on top of the world if if there is karma right if karma is real that's the karma cuz this guy was on the top of the world but he was like forcing everyone. Karma saying do you want to suck my dick don't want to I don't want to hurt you like he would lose money based on how many different counts of sexual harassment he has they were negotiating depended upon him being a predator like they kind of knew what would you mean kind of if they are also liable here oh my thing is one of the agents going to jail the ones that kept sending all the actresses to the guy then when the new the new can say hey Harvey Weinstein raped me and then the agency says listen do you want this job or not like those those people those people but if you're an agent and you've known Harvey Weinstein for for 5 years or 10 years and you know he's been doing this but yet you continue to sin actresses right to this guy just a pig and you trying to talk those girls into willingly having sex with him which many did or did they think it was a rapist because he was both of those things apparently he was a guy who had sex with girls who were willing to hold themselves out to be in movies and he also forced himself on women who did not want to have anything to do with him so we had both of those things were going on but you don't think that agencies that were sending all these big actresses in they didn't know they knew the boat types some girls willing and some girls are saying there rape you don't think question you don't think any actress ever went back to the agent I'm never going in again I got raped and then that and then that agent was like alright I'm not going to send you anymore but hey over here go in the Harvey well I like the way you negotiating here because the way you're saying it doesn't give a person now you're saying you don't think cuz no one saying that they don't think that. No one's arguing that they don't think that's you said you don't think that so you learn from that book yes very clever what I would say is if there's a high likelihood that they at least suspected he had forced himself on some women and there was probably some rumors there was 100% likelihood they knew it was a pig there was a high likelihood that there was some stories about some things that he had did that were probably criminal High likelihood I don't know how many people are privy to those stories I don't know how deep it got in whether it mean like if you're an agent did you actually get to send to Harvey Weinstein how many you know I don't know I'm sure I'm sure whoever he wanted to see right but I don't know what that number is I don't know how much they actually knew we can be pretty sure of it this point is is no way all these women are not oh no I believe look icing made in advancement on Gwyneth Paltrow and Brad Pitt confronted and said I'll f****** kill you you do that again this is the thing Brad Pitt new Brad Pitt knows and he's one of the 1995 and he told him if you ever make her feel uncomfortable again I'll kill you but this isn't a joke this is a 1995 25 years ago bro so you're telling me that these agents in the industry we are I didn't even know the guy for the I heard the story but this would it said is that he touched her inappropriately invited her to his bedroom she told her then-boyfriend Brad Pitt about it see that's what I think most people hurt and that's gross older than boyfriend Brad Pitt about it see that's what I think most people would hurt and that's gross it's not great sea that I think most people knew about that s*** and Brad Pitt was willing to kill him over that which I love</div>

Best basic to them they have to have technology we haven't even know they don't know the Active technology that's slightly more advanced than us we will be able to unquestionably travel to other planets within a hundred years or 200 years let's say 3 317 20 long so it's like we went back in time to visit people in the 1700 will be fascinated and we'd be very interested and we found a planet somewhere 300 years now that I people on that planet live like people lived here in the 1700 we would be blown away I think it's the most unique and interesting thing we've ever found ever in life I just don't know what everyone having a cell phone can take footage why don't they have like why don't multiple people have the same footage of the same thing like it had they do there are some sightings particular the Phoenix Lights that happened in the 90s that many many people captured I don't know exactly what they are they don't know what is a lot of people captured these lights are in the sky my take on the Phoenix Lights in a lot of these things is usually that there's some sort of a military aircraft are working. But here's the thing they don't have to visit all the time if they only visited once or twice these unique experiences that have happened once or twice over the course of human history or three times or 10 times or a hundred times what are the odds of anyone's going to capture it especially if they're smart about it so I should be smart about how they come specially if they have some sort of cloaking apparatus are they have some ability to understand when they're not they're being viewed observed and don't knowing how to hide I had a camouflage the ships but of course it would be interested I know that's the least plausible scenario that they wouldn't be interested in us the thing that kind of the thing that was interested in me when you interview to know his he's been through everything anytime No Heaven no evidence hundreds of years and deeply diving into the subject of UFOs and has access to not only that like what does he have access to is that access to the NSA files and like everything's compartmentalised you know that's one of the big problems with the military said they NASA does not have access to what the Navy has access to which doesn't have access to what the Army has access to like they don't always cooperate and just fill for him to say that he didn't find anything about UFOs that make sense like he probably even looked a little bit and finally about UFOs that doesn't mean there's nothing about UFOs that just means that he didn't find anything okay there when you think about one person that's going to scour all the government recce understand the 1950s to present about what they've discovered and what they haven't so you so Area 51 what do you think it's in their secret military projects crafts and that's where the Blackbird came out of this with a stealth bomber came out of there was a lot of that stuff that a lot of people mistook for UFOs I think the real question lies in the very small percentage of unexplained sightings so if you look at UFO sightings you take the pie of UFO sightings I would say they're not me they say what they're talking about that's been solved to someone in the neighborhood of 95% of those 95% can be explained by swamp. ball lightning ball light needs a phenomenon that comes when depending upon tectonic pressure the Earth can release this lightning that have the ground that travels in a ball shape pattern and Zig through the sky and then vanishes and disappears they don't totally understand how it's being created but they do know it requires some pressure in the earth something about tectonic plates and possibly different atmospheric conditions but it's a real observable phenomenon that actually occurred on plane like it's flown down the down the passageway of a jet at one point in time people are multiple people observed as ball lightning and they thought they were being boarded by a f****** UFO or something it's a weird even ever seen it it's very weird phenomena because they have observed that's really fascinating that's that's responsible for a lot of UFO sighting what you said there's that 5% that can't be explained that 5% 4% they just haven't figured out how we see this is ball lightning okay having this guy but they move around so lightning crackles and then this thing will hover in the sky and then sometimes they actually come out of the ground you know this is Pierson probably but it's almost like an ash you know when uses a bad video see if there's you know I understand all this other people talking in it there's different videos with ball lightning in a watch is pretty interesting s*** man Balinese weird because it's like they're it's okay Lowe's of it and it looks like a ball flying through the sky are atmospheric occurrence if I was an alien species 500 years more advanced than we are I would be f****** fascinated by Earth and that's all you need five hundred years from now with the exponential growth of Technology like we're experiencing on Earth now if we don't blow ourselves up or if they're different than us like maybe they evolve different and they don't have the same battle for resources so they didn't develop the kind of territorial behavior that Apes have if they develop something more complex in a different sort of Cooperative evolutionary mechanism they could be very different than us but still way more advanced but interested in us all right I will you ever see one in your lifetime Advanced but interested in us all right I will you ever see one in your lifetime</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> something that we always up against is the months that the people of got into about aging that they needed to get into full these Millennia that we have been unable to do anything about it but not think about it and get on with your miserable short life and I make the best of it right and across the way we can do that is by somehow denying oneself into denying that this is such a big deal by pretending it's not really like a medical problem at all that's what we paid attention to what the kite has the forever will it be boring and you know which I have to spend my whole life contending with how do you say when I get over the dictators living forever one Johnny come on when I leave the percentage of dictators versus the percentage of regular people is so incredibly small to not cure aging because of dictator seems like the dumbest idea ever now the inevitable like it though it's fine that's wonderful I'm looking forward to it it's it's essentially a disease that we all get cooling agent disease is a bit different from my house more comfortable with it I tend to feel that the problem is a problem with which is that it makes it sound like it could be cured with therapy and you know the reason why that's important is that it determines what kind of what kind of medicine we look for a lot of outside brother said we're right by the what diseases used to broadly contribute Naruto it's not to include things like Alzheimer's that actually about the basic difference between the progressive chronic conditions like outside what would you call aging if you don't call this is what I call a medical problem of potential future treatments stem cells seem to be very promising are there are there other competing treatments that you think are equally promising or so a bunch of different types of damage all of which we need to fix then we need to look at the I will fix it available for each individual type so what stem cell the last fix is so lost without it dying and then replaced in the body by television Elektra Beijing is that because Progressive because it's only because it's functional decline after a certain point does it right off that when I would have to keep in mind in time to time therapy between how badly one needs it and how rapidly the quality of the therapy is improving so you know if I open now start to need a bit more but it would have benefited from 10 years of research let's do a different thing to fix a different type of damage and I believe they accumulation of 85 South a bunch of different things we have to do that there's been no real change over the past 20 years in our understanding of what the problem is no real need to change preferred approach S2 Technologies found bad news that says OD of this potential approach to fixing this particular type of damage if I'm going to wear for this new reason that we didn't know before that's what we have to start again and think of anyone that hasn't happened to either</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you have the same optimistic perception about the ocean optimism because I know that you are not doing it but I know a lot of people when they talk to me and call me an optimist optimist storing lot of carbon and releasing a lot that it's pulling up so we have to fix that as well but it's part of the same problem I've had boy Onslaught on a couple times can you wear of him doing his devices that he's created to remove Plastics and other garbage from the ocean might my concern is Wildfish the depletion of the fish populations is at an unprecedented rate and it seems to be there somewhere in the neighborhood of fifty years away from a catastrophic complete collapse of wild Fisheries how to connect artificial red Mate1 up make artificial fish that wouldn't that would be good that we can have artificial tears but that wouldn't necessarily make that population rebound we would have to make large steps to try to bring back the the equilibrium of the ocean I mean applications of population of specific fish fish species fishing to make this artificial fish or don't have the access to it or at least in the time. That it's going to take four Fisheries rebound as it did when I talk to people that have an understanding of wildlife in the ocean they say it's a desperate time and it's a desperate time that is not really being recognized by the general population because they can still get sushi they can still get halibut at the local market but that if you talk to the fishermen if you talk to the wildlife biologist that are really studying the levels he likes it this is nearing a point of no return we should be investing more in the development of new technologies that will - play with wild fish if they can make artificial meat and one or two people really get an artificial fish as well. people like the night I'm really optimistic about artificial meat I mean it seems that they're mean it one point I was like a quarter million dollars for a hamburger and now they've got it down to a point where you can actually make a an animal meat product that does not come from an animal die a very close to be able to make this mass-marketed way that's interesting you can actually make a an animal meat product that does not come from an animal dying their very close to be able to make this in mass-marketed way that's interesting about that I think that's very interesting</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> wow it's been 10 years really 2007 I moved out of La damn weird until recently 3 times appreciate it I appreciate you I appreciate you today I always thought truthfully I always thought Joe Rogan's going to do something good I honestly I can tell you that and it may be embarrassing to say but I'm proud of you can second thing besides stand up comedian the announcer want to be in the UFC even if I was good because you get pounded on it's a tough job right yeah let you know that I'll answer this kids fight their retired at 21 and rolling around with you the greatest memories of my time in LA is when Eddie opened 10th Planet yeah we had a lot of fun and it was such a special interesting time of Jiu-Jitsu I think that it was going to know no gay there's a demographic of Jiu-Jitsu guys who didn't want to be any more people wanted to learn things that would transition directly into MMA and to not have the clothes to grab onto it change the grips and Eddie was one of the very first to really truly concentrate I'm using wrestling grips cable grips over unders things along those lines and then the other people were still really cleaning to the gate he was like a and I think that I was attracted to about the ultimate fighting when I first saw I think the first one I saw with two in UFC 2 and I was like oh man this is any watch those Gracie and action videos and stuff is lackadaisical and I'd always have to tell the guys had do me a favor just try to slap me because this is getting a little unreal I don't want to I want a real life situation and I'm figuring okay I don't want to buy anything right now but I always felt like you no real practical fighting the guy may not be wearing a tuxedo I think both are good because like you live in New York New York gets cold if you get into a scuffle with someone I hope you never would do but if you did and he was jacking like you are as you could manipulate him with that jacket and they really probably wouldn't know what to do you know there's a real benefits like being a judo player if some has a winter coat on yeah are you had a fight with Karo parisyan to Ronda Rousey or something like that and they they're wearing a winter coat that f*** you up stop exploding out of things have to be very patient if to be if these correct technique and it was appreciation and it was one of my biggest Lamentations of moving away was not to be around that whole Posse and then I never expected it to get as big as it did I know it's unbelievable because back then it was like to see text to bring my my big kids were big now I used to bring them and they used to just box we used to do it at Legends know before that the bomb squad yeah that's 2,000 what to somewhere on that was cool I was running time I just got my purple was super excited and then Eddie just got his black he has brown eyes black super quick. Is brown and then he beat Oiler and then he goes black yeah I was there that day interesting error was an interesting error for us as humans was an interesting error for martial arts is a lot going on and that 10th planet was really a hub of exciting Innovation and still is but it mean back then it was this really unique things this completely noogie branch of Jiu-Jitsu this directly connected to John Jacque Machado which is a totally rigid always impressed with him to me still rolls man he's my age and he doesn't get injured like he might have like a little tweak here and every so intelligent and he's so Technical and it's just so good that was saying was only because I'm not there anymore but when I was going there is like this is such an amazing Place John Jacque Academy the quality of Fighters you would get there was also at a time where there was you have to be into it and go somewhere and could have that many black belts at a school that was like unheard of in hunger I was in his class one day and it was like 11 black belts was like this is crazy and it wasn't like that. No random roll black belt somewhere somewhere in Portland or something like that like I went I started with henzo in New York I went there the day that I met * got to purple. Wow that's crazy crazy gave me a crugen ghee wow that's legit that's one of the really nice things about Jiu-Jitsu that camaraderie in the Friendship it's like it's very different than I was compared to other martial arts in that the problem was striking martial arts is that you hurt each other all the time you never developed a sort of closeness that you do what you just said because you're always trying to kick each other's f****** heads off</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> we still never got to the bhagavad-gita sorry but we got turned I want to know why you think that that's real and what you think is going on in those stories wet first you got the dialogue of self which is cool wisdom for all people I am become death coloring sheet probably do Got Talent time that's a Sanskrit how did you say to me it looks like a creep preterito is that why am I am the Destroyer time I am the great destroyer and I've come to destroy all worlds translation in English because of an issue with the translation between English Rose different people translate let the different but it's it's similar meaning meaning in that particular section that you pulled out that was Krishna explaining like God is beautiful. As Charming as your best friend is also death personified so he's staying in that particular place I'm actually also the destroy of all the world's when we think of the Olga's explain it. Is everything both the Beauty and the destruction as well and so Krishna just sharing his attributes and in that particular chapter chapter 11 these is the most almost intimidating where do you think all these stories come from where do you what do you think the origin of the Bhagavad Gita of the Mahabharat of evolved the ancient tax what do you think the origin was what was the what was the motivation put the stuff down what was what was the original Concepts that led them to write this and where you're at all come from there has to be an origin of these these wisdom's right yeah what do you think that is enough to even answer the question I have to take myself out of Radu and just answer like a yoga teacher and crackers that to answer of what do you think it's one thing trained not to do in s far as what is your personal opinion I give you my personal opinion but I have to separate it from what the stories both will give me a personal opinion is I hear what the stories have to offer I find some value in the stories and I try to apply wisdom to my life it helps the direction of my life it helps me escape pod transmitted as certain time historically they understood people are getting Dumber do we have a tendency to think we're at the Pinnacle of evolution but The Vedic teachings is at as we go on in this age we get more more disconnected there was a time where architecture was more evolved for the Sciences were more evolved wearing Stop The Sciences were more evolved like the building of these has which one we read them mythological even Weaponry Weaponry they say we're done with sound if you start at there's one book on the Donner okay but do you think this is real I think it could be that use sound could could why not was no evidence archaeological evidence that there was a flying craft or is it grimsever any technology that allowed people to leave gravity yeah there's sometimes there may not be evidence just like this with him and his woman with two people psychosis with him and his wife I can say that there are things that make no sense to me get I swear to try them anyway and then after time they made sense like oh wait a second that does make sense or a different Vantage points in my life it didn't make sense when it's 20 but at 50 that makes a lot of sense so there's certain things that are huge leap to Faith that I can't say menosense mineral sense but over time I realize after that helps in this particular meditation and general right achieve certain States Of Consciousness and you can actually with fmri can actually monitor the changes in the way the brain is she this why I like about you you're one of those guys get into these very interesting like subtle sciences and then he finds like hard evidence James Wilkin breaking all these things down I'm more of a simple or guy I find people were a trust the way they live and if applied stuff and walk the it's more like I can tell time but I don't know how to take apart and put back together but then you see all the gears behind a watch like a self-winding watch me like I don't know what the f*** is happening here I'm like that with a lot of things and I'm always impressed when you dig into it with people like this but truthfully if you want to be honest truth I was like no man I've taken to it maybe cuz I'm not that kind of hard Science Guy if people what do you think right like the stuff that you liked about me fighting was endurance flexibility I give all the credit that to yoga you did at the time of people that you you had crazy cardio and your cardio was you never did cardio you just didn't really good endurance and my cardio is even better at once on day 17 of a 21-day fast wow they 17 and I remember fighting what to class and we're all tank more like I just kept on going and he's like man what is up with you I was like I don't know I haven't eaten solid food in 17 days so it's not like I'm a genius it's just that these are sort of like yoga fasting deep breathing I just been doing them yet I'm sure there's people that can give you the modern take on what the benefits are and that's not what I'm asking you what I'm asking is why you believe the bhagavad-gita is real my point is there's reasonable amounts of faith in these other things that have applied that it made me take a next step to whether I believe it's real I just split the truth so I can extract from a real whether the war actually happened there's a leap of faith benefits of those of the following those scriptures you apply and you you feel those benefits of so that's enough that's enough to make me move forward toward your free sample the idea of faith and especially in America the Blind Faith but if I saw you walking in downtown the other way you saw me you're driving your Porsche and you saw me walking in Manhattan and how do you get to Times Square and the first step is I could lie to you people lie all the time when you asked him for directions but you have some reasonable faith I know him he's a friend why would he give me the address and so there's a reasonable amount of Faith but even still people getting to the Egos and they just want to be the nowhere of directions but I say you don't have to 14th Street and you're going to see a McDonald's you take a right and you going to go down all the way to whatever care anymore Union Square and take a left and then a hard left so again you have some type of extended Faith towards me not Blind Faith but you'd go to 14th Street and there's that McDonald's as you go to next signpost you realize maybe he doesn't always going then you go farther there's Union Square okay I think he actually knows what what's going on and also send you see the Times Square in the distance so Faith isn't just like I believe if anyone was to say I believe this I believe in these Vimana I believe in Monsters to question them but it happens with small degrees of of things being shown to you that you want to take it what's the next step here what I say about this where they say about that and then you apply and see what does that work with me and like I said sometimes things didn't make sense I remember when I first met monks and they said a question about I was 17 I was like you want sex with your wife crazy now I am we do other things and I just couldn't understand that is a 17 year old boy for 18 year old boy and he said what do you do for fun and that he goes but it was where this person was one of his path of a really controlling the senses and finding his pleasure internally at different at time of my life it made no sense whatsoever the applying the stuff whether or not you break it down scientifically and objectively and try to analyze each and every word and whatever the translation is you actually apply those truths are quotes to your life and have real benefits yeah it could all these things we talked about like life on other planets and Aliens they all are very much explain or here's another good one one of these spiritual path have in common weren't we train ourselves to find the differences and all of them and the date of teaching don't you understand you should be able to walk into a moth into a church into a synagogue and say how nice these people trying to connect not that we got to win these people over to our team cuz they're all an illusion and they're all going to hell forever everyone's on his type of path and I appreciate them trying to surrender in the only thing that's going to get in their way cuz people say things like this all the time religion that caused all the problems in this world and particular that we have it our way and everybody else their problem and we got to fix it that's what gets in the way because you could say materialism causes lots of problems as well in the world so I don't think it's that the Eagles sneaky and sneak into your diet and sneak into your God it'll sneak in and that's why there's an appreciation instead of a instead of condemnation people that are different than us so I don't think it's that the Eagles sneaky it'll sneak into your diet will sneak into your God will sneak in and that's why there's an appreciation instead of a instead of condemnation people that are different than us</div>

Pay my way to go to conferences going to go stop them nobody needed me and I wasn't being blessed don't be crazy and it took a little while for people to come around so when you when you say that an early age you felt compelled to try to help people like what what was that it was all down to my mother's for me to practice the piano poop some however my mother had already and still in me a sense of introspection understand why I thought what I thought I actually decided to think about why I didn't want to play the piano because they were already so I would not be you know contributing significantly to the quality of life of mankind by becoming another one that I wanted to make a difference and that's how I know by the time I was out of your future you know it nine years old recognize that you're not going to make a significant contribution to the World by doing something other people I've already done I started working actually out that bioinformatics project that I mentioned I came I had a lot of exposure to a lot of top-flight biologist and fashionable would be is going on here why are these small people choosing to do something that minimizes the likelihood that will have any impact another words whatever they whatever they find out so you've always felt compelled to make a difference is that something your mother and still in use or something you just had a baby I don't I don't really think my mother instilled in me I have no idea but when you look back at that now that's going to be an interesting course where you you recognized at a very young age that you wanted to make some sort of a difference but that didn't knowing that you would have that Epiphany at a young age when it comes to like being a penis or doing something that's going to significantly impact people it is not a standard path that many people are gone that's it it's a very interesting way to set up your life well I wouldn't say is that my life up I sat outside and tension but if we look at how I got from there to here so if you have been able to reach the Pinnacle of my child from Philippines Abba you know how anyone can say that you fit the part 2 you're a weirdo you know I mean I'm always instinctively looking for ways to do things that other people might have a lot do you understand that I am really sympathetic to email but that doesn't mean that anything of benefit it's a very strange thing where people put on intellectual blinders they're talking about aging and dying it is very weird have you have had heated discussions with other intellectuals about this because I would imagine all the time my first year 1982 stage hypnotists that stuck in my mind was that is the cookie cross because what happens if the guy gives a completely unhesitating Lucid grammatically correct explanation for why I couldn't do it and the explanation of course we'll have a hole in it besides him, but the fact is Bowling Green Ohio to have these discussions with people about aging and side to find out that people make the unbelievable arguments in favor of it</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> think about overpopulation 1 things that you should take into consideration is that as populations increase in places urbanized the actual birth rate goes down to the point where a place is like Japan is actually concerned that they're not having enough children Africa China's because of the one-child policy which of course I have not discontinued precisely because of problems like that other countries were little 500 years old how will people be okay so here is his a really important when we think about longevity one question is how was well actually be on the second question is how well people in the Nets and expect the world to be the reason why those two questions yeah but won't actually be any 500 Arrow paper for another 400 years so I don't rely the general manager straight starts to realize that the probably going to live a long time because they're not going to just got progressively sicker as I got older and pension plans very different life insurance health insurance play critical to estimate and to communicate the estimate of how soon that shift in public expectation is going to a car which means could easily happen in the next 3 to 5 years and but when it does happen it's going to happen incredibly suddenly that I think it's going to happen we're going to have sufficient progress in the DeBarge family or the clinic that most of my scientific colleagues are going to be willing to come out and say more Lafayette over to grab it right all along you know about that I'm going to hear that being said and written in the media and the going to say this is actually going to happen and I'm going to slice. do this phenomenon then we do kind of have a bit of a moral obligation to make it less time if we can't tell my fans is that once that happened the following day it's going to be and everyone's going to know it like the way the public is going to make that switch I just actually expectation black at once so it's going to be ridiculous once it happened and the first step is going to be that shift in what my colleagues in the community feel able to say on camera amount of progress is going to be required for that to occur one reason why my colleagues don't already said what I say is funding the fact that I don't like me those people Reliant for most of the money that drives our Sac on Fairview government money government grants and the two accused of irresponsible things for the media things that get people's hopes up unduly but this hardly at the end of the ceremony so I have to be really pretty, even though that is probably the person out of my colleagues who put as much as possible out of people who have regular faculty position no, actually it's not very much you know there's a balance between on the one hand not saying things that could be characterized as a responsible when they were already in middle-aged and refusing to get to the point where this is undeniable this is peer reviewed proven established science and also implementable this is something that can be at scale distributed worldwide yeah things going to get real weird thing in humans it is a really really polarizing subject I mean it is funny how what you're saying bring so true that academics and intellectuals have to be cautious about talking about even what is potentially possible even though in private they probably are more than aware that there's just a few steps to go before this stuff gets into my tendon we see relief katestraat me really spectacular changes that Pandora's Box gets opened then people are going to be looking to establish clinics everywhere and it's it could be change even if even if even if a lot of these things are not yet available for clinical you still at the beginning of the clinical trial price for 15 years away from The Real McCoy you know that will still be enough so true and prepared for this change in public expectation of how long they're going to live one day will be a gigantic public issue in terms of elected representatives that they they're going to need to have some sort of an anti-aging policy situation public issue in terms of elected representatives that they are going to need to have some sort of an anti-aging policy situation normal so this will be ridiculous</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> and I'm walking around it for about six and a half years and it was a great time in life and I traveled all over the world but it was that place after after being very materially frustrated and I said those two main factors were some type of material success I wasn't the Beatles when I wasn't email Michael Jackson but I had some interest I had fans and then realizing how life can get taken away from you in a moment with with with that precarious place my father was at it just made me start thinking what the hell am I doing the short short life what am I supposed to do give me some yes give me some where do I go from here what do I want out of life what is the what is a homerun is it to be a very famous is that is that the homerun is it to be collected tons of stuff is that aren't you know some type of art is that a homerun and so this was my burning question and now it's still New Yorker I was still sort of like you do New York in the 80s Street Smart New York I'm actually from Connecticut but I started hanging out in New York City my parents were New Yorkers and so we stood my older brothers live in the city so I visit them but soon the time I was fourteen I used to just go to New York City and just hang out on the weekends and when I became a monk and went to India I had saved about twenty five thousand bucks not a lot of money and I thought you my brain okay this is my cynical self I'm going to go to India going to get a guru on my money this how it works but when I actually lived with the monks in India especially India van 1988 there is no Central AC and it's hot there is no heat and it's cold in the winter the showers are freezing cuz all the water kept on a tank on the roof of the ashram in the summer water super hot cuz it's all kept in a tank top of the ashram there's no Creature Comforts whatsoever you go to bed early and wake up super early to go to bed 8:30 you wake up 3 in the morning there's nothing that there's nothing to buy there's nothing to purchase all the fun things that we like to ease the pain of existence are not there there's no comedy strip everything away from a person they lose it they hop the fence so to speak I've seen that happen or they learn to find their pleasure from something more subtle and so when I first went there and saw the joy of the monks I realized they don't want my money they don't want anything I have to offer them I want what they have that was sort of a game changer moment for me I want to figure out how to be connected with nothing what did these guys do all day sure they all got their thing different things but later I started doing my next band because the interesting thing about the bog of agita Bhagavad Gita is your familiar with its one chapter of the biggest epic in the world the mahabhart and it's it it's the most studied and discussed and commented on by all the saints of ancient India people even bring into politics and stuff but it's a real conversation between the spirit and divine divinity conversation about just about is just what it just considered ancient wisdom for all people so that one of the ideas of the Gita is you don't give up what you're born to do you do what you do but in the spirit away you don't try to like wipeout your desires it's not going to happen you take what you do and you do it in a way that is going to assist you in your Liberation and it was going to assist everybody else I'll say I love comedy but I want comedy that uplift me and not doesn't degrade me I like entertainment that when I walk away from it I learned something I feel like I'm growing I feel connected I don't want stuff that's going to just give me darker thoughts like the Joker and I've never seen it it didn't say I want to say that I live in a farm a little farm we rarely watch anything comedy comedy I think laughing so important but I don't watch so much TV so pretty and I do love the movie movies it's out of like with my wife let's just we want to get away from the kids and want to do something but there's no plan on what to watch but I'm open to good idea so Jokers are really good movie but it's really dark it's really dark you walk out of there feeling really confused like you like it did I like that it was awesome I know it's really well done but I like that and it's a it's a It's Complicated me we could get we could talk about the Joker for the next 2 hours garage and you become like what you store in that garage so the thoughts the thoughts that we put in the mine got to be careful with the words before they are like repetitive sounds but they're considered transcendental sounds Entre you might have known it from the soundtrack of hair Hari Krishna Hari Krishna Krishna Krishna Hari Hari Hari Rama Hari Rama Rama Rama Hari Hari it's considered a transcendental sound for the mind and it sort of connects the soul with divinity doesn't matter what religion you are is considered a mantra sound vibration as a potency on the mon was really get the word Mantra from and delivers them on or the Mind somewhat we snore in the mind starts to create our external being and if you don't believe in it it's one of those things we have mantras in our mind anyway I have things on Loop running through my mind that have been handed to me from parents from elementary school teachers from a crazy uncle for self-loathing you're not good enough and these are the mantras running through the yoga system says notice those munchers that's part of self edification or self-realization you notice what's playing in the mind and you replace those monstrous with transcendental sound or at the very least training the mind to see greatness and people that's a big thing cuz the Maya and the way the material mind wants to see it if shortcomings that doesn't make me better at all so that material mind which is Cease one is so insecure that I have to lash out at other people to make myself feel whole and it's just crazy crazy thinking stinking thinking whereas the yogi tree I specifically teach bhakti Yoga Yoga connection or The Yoga of the heart and starts to deal with all the essence the teachings of the Gita which is you train yourself to see greatness and other people and if I start to note it's good you could take this from a micro like my relationship with you I want to notice all Joe's great qualities now when you hear that you might think he appreciates us something to even see things in us we can't see in ourselves we want to become like that that's why these idea of changing the world really starts with yourself connection is I am a spiritual being Joe is a spiritual being and I started train myself in not seeing what show does wrong seeing everything he does right it's a great exercise for the brain what does that do person do right what is the good in this person that I that I'm overlooking cuz I'm just lens Define shortcoming some people and it screws people up tremendously even so-called spiritual people so you spent six and a half years living like this in this ashram just trying to sort things out no no sex no masturbation what are you eating out of that what kind of food they serve you strict vegetarian at 2 an estimated about it especially do I was a rough food is so that these wrong mister up everyone's got their take on medicine and healing let me share the yogi perspective of it the missing ingredient in food the vitamin the super food that has never spoken about is love food is supposed to be grown prepared and then offered in the other offering is not into a human offering us to God that's called prashad food is first called Boga Boga means it's for enjoyment and then you take that enjoyment before you enjoy it you offering it first back like in sacrifice the ideas that everything in this world is not for me everything is I'm not the center I'm here to serve the center so all the food takes on the consciousness of the prepare of the food so to eat junk food or to have people with very low Consciousness cooking your food you're taking that into your body you're taking the consciousness of the prepare of the food do believe that affect if I walked outside that line so for years I'd only eat food cooked by brahmins like like the priests of the ashram or I would cook it myself later have a very weird story which was I became a bunch of my friends that were monks we started our own band and we started a record label a second record label in the ashram I can give you not the first time and so what happened was this band we started that we were all monks and we would take a candy stove on tour with us and we pull over to the side of the road and we make kitchari with rice and Dal and fenugreek and coriander and cumin and we just cut him cuz you wouldn't eat outside food because if you did you would you would you would feel it you would feel it affect your mind maybe I don't know the effect of taking the consciousness of someone who is on a low vibration is cooking your food you just numbed what you just eat the food cuz you're hungry people are numb to it people aren't aware of that concept as opposed to some guy just going to make a burger at White Castle or whatever it is so so I don't know it depends on the individual perception or is it a is an actual energy and doesn't matter I think it's both whether I believe it or not but there's is there is a concept of once you get that food you don't eat the food you honor the food so it's not going to be like me shoving stuff in my mouth if you see my eating habits but it should be more than that the eating itself should be a meditation and it's been proven I'm not one of these guys there's something that's there's a similarity that's going to seem like it's not like it's not a parallel but in hunting when you hunt an animal and you kill that animal you butcher that animal and then you feed it to your family that's it sounds almost critical it sound like there's no way that would be a spiritual feeling but there's a connection to your food that's very very different well we've divorced yourself from killing animals for the most part for the most part most people hire people right most people have no clue where their fruits come from the vegetables come from what you know what a brussel sprouts look like when they grow bananas look like on the grill what is Ground Round Divorce Yourself from our food for the most part the most part most people hire people right most people have no clue where their fruits come from the vegetables come from what you know what a brussel sprouts look like when they grow bananas look like on the grill what is Ground Round in a divorce yourself from our food</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> buy wet Joe this interesting thing I want to talk to mention to you too cuz you brought this point like I like living my life right live why wouldn't you want to do that again because I didn't challenge it a little because you are saying in retrospect to heal that I don't want to take birth again planets in higher beings they say that that planet like Earth and they said his other ones like this as well there is some pleasure and some pain there's people live in a penthouse and his people are sleeping on the streets or you can be on the hundredth whatever floor was the World Trade Center and be a CEO and then a plane can be wrapped it up two floors underneath you you can go from Pleasure and Pain the most excruciating plane and most incredible highest in a moment so in this sort of that plant places that are like places in the world are like the rape capital of the world and then you've got places that are sort of like Indigo Switzerland or Norway with currency strong people are beautiful and everything you see is like a postcard so we have like great mass of pain and pleasure on this planet in such a condition you could start I'm like why am I here what is life about that it gives you a win to to even ask those questions now if there's just so much pleasure in your life they said it higher beings don't have the impetus to evolve because there's so much pleasure higher being higher being therefore the impetus to get out of samsara repeated birthday there's no impetus to get out some people are suffering so much there's no impetus to even see a spiritual light people are suffering tremendously maybe go to prison or they get to get caught up in more degraded activity so much people have so much time in your life you have so much good karma so to speak but because you're still embodied there always be sort of like a pinprick because it's part of having a body right but my point was this journey is enjoyable and that is that all it is because I've had bad moments of meat is is it all just made if you like the direction did you choose to push forward in the understanding of the push-and-pull the understanding of the discipline and the working in the kindness and the generosity and that all these things are connected together and then also the expression the ability to express yourself through podcast for through stand-up comedy. All these things are enjoyable and that there's a pursuit in that and that they're real benefit of it is at other people get entertainment out of it and that it isn't seeing other people sing songs but people don't play them back at their bands before the rain day like the Buzzcocks from the 70s but they just wanted the right time historically you are alive and enjoying life the idea of doing it forever is terrified people that was what my point was like why is it terrifying was not terrifying to do it now why is the Eternal existence so disturbing to people right unless they have had a traumatic life people have yes people would have not had a traumatic life whoever fair look if you are in America and you're not sick and you have friends you're doing infinitely better than most people on planet sure you know what that's just we're really fortunate in terms of like the environment so we exist in if you're not being abused and you have a job and you have no hobbies and things to do God damn you lucky you could be born in Afghanistan you could be living in the Congo suffering from a host of different pathogens and bacteria and viruses and but your thing is according to that person was at helium made up that idea I don't think you made it obviously was a great warrior as well as a great Jiu-Jitsu teacher but he had this philosophy on existence and that you had to live your life and do the right things always and if you didn't you would come back again and do it all over again will The Vedic system is it is similar things that you don't get bored as Joe Rogan again living than the parallel life and like I didn't take out the garbage that day I should have taken out the garbage and more be like according to your desires and your activities and your thoughts and the people you associate with you moved up psychically you got a little more degraded upgrade or degrade basic interesting life you carved out do you feel like your past life as had some sort of an impact on who you are right now for sure for sure for sure really why you so sure I'm well it's just sort of like my worldview is that there's not a random this that everything is building upon something in the same building upon tomorrow today so you can do my own thing on next week by week this week and he could take a bigger and bigger and bigger so in that sense it makes sense but there's a there's a little bit more to leave a faith like and I'm building up to a climax where I'll take another body or I'm coming from a place where I have some talents you know we call them your god-given gifts or your you know my daughter is a gifted artist but the idea is that it's been a practice that we've been practicing and bringing with us for lifetimes and both are both good and bad belief system that you just sort of a. Because there's not really any evidence it's adopted is that's how the Yogi's view Karma and Timber you taking this in yourself as well in this lifetime like I said that I don't know there's Blind Faith and then there's reasonable Faith so my reasonable faith lies in this lifetime I've witnessed my body change eyewitness my mind change my intelligence change I've witnessed myself cultivate desires that heal me make me stronger make me lighter make me more connected I've witnessed myself shoes bad choices things that are addictive things that are defiling my Consciousness or my body or my health so in this lifetime I know I have I can steer my karma and at the same time there's certain things that are out of my hands like you and me a flight to San Diego and what would you on that plane the plane Journeys are, what we do on that plane that's our Free Will so that's the difference between Freewill and Destiny there is there is a difference of the two just because there is karma doesn't mean you're bound to it you can move it but the yoga system is to bring us to this do all the things that the whole culture is based to keep the Mind peaceful and from the mind is peaceful I act Less on impetus and more from a higher chakras are higher thoughts are higher intelligence for example if I slap a panther Panthers going to bite me why does pandas bite when you slap them if I slap Joe you could act from different place hey man what's up immediately and sometimes I feel that also I feel like I'm acting from a lower place anyway I was parented and try to like from a higher place so there's always a human species there's always the chance to either upgrade your activities or degrade your activities and a snowball author like every good choice helps make a better choice you know what we really said it would die with exercise talk about that show that your karma is connected to what you've done in the past life sure people you look at their life and you think this person where they are right now is directly connected to what they've done in the past life they take you back and when you really study this Vedic thought you realized that there is no more blaming anybody I've just got what I've got for whatever reason now what am I going to do with that you know what am I going to do today while the wind never happens because I've got what I got and to be truthful I have a blind side a blind spot when it comes to anyting atrocious I've done in this life I forgot all the times of hurt people broke people's Parts you know it was rude or cruel or thought was so I got to get some, too in this life what the speed of a previous life Olivia stew and dance here's your option you can either be free from that be Acceptance in except that there's benevolent forces that are trying to teach us lessons to get out of it or you can just be better at the world why me unfair so this idea of benevolent forces that are trying to teach us how do you feel that this spiritual Quest is almost like a Divine puzzle that he when beings are proposed and that you're you are given this infinite series of options and in choosing the right way of thinking and behaving you can carve out the righteous path as best you can you will make mistakes but that there is there's a spiritual undertaking that is a part of operating this puzzle correctly and that this is what all these teachings are about and it's trying to we're all trying to relay what we've learned and what we've experienced personally and we're trying to relay it to other people so that they can relate and so that they can also make choices that will allow them to more refined their approach to life to achieve better spiritual balance do yamas yama-yama guardrails on the road you scratch a car has the guardrail but if it wasn't there would be complete tragedy so they're sort of like things that we pull in with our sexuality with our thoughts with our words it's it's how to use the vehicle in this lifetime for the vehicle the body run what we do what we don't do what we don't but we know what to eat what what to think what to speak how to make a relate to people how to relate to Junior to relate to seniors so the whole beta cultures carved out like this that in itself is not spiritual it just assist you and driving a car I still got to go north and so once I can take care of how to like take care of this machine and keep it on the road then I reach out for connection and that's the spirit so there's Dharma but then there's Dharma that it's supposed to get us connected of Dharma what is that did the definition rather be normal again darmanin sort of like a rambler right living it's not some people confuse it with one doing what you're born to do because I don't think it's just doing what you're good at cuz you could be good at leadership and be a dictator in an in and out your great later and was going to do what you do but Hitler was a great leader great leader is probably in his chart but then you also have great great leaders like Christ also so it's not just leadership is leading person towards connection so that your activity has a a benevolent effect on everyone it touches that's Dharma Dharma is true sense and that's a darn of your body like your Dharma is you entertained you could say a warrior you could also am also dumb as a father so that's it all type of like your carved out for that you know if you weren't doing that you don't feel like a little lack in your life but then there's like an intradermal what you and the Nicoderm is actually the Dharma of the soul and that's why in The Vedic system it's not like you're trying to convert somebody to be of your religion is not like a homerun to say okay change is up a joining the same church of the same ashram it's like a Souls assault it's a truth truth is truth there's no no no one's got a monopoly on truth there's no such thing as genuine meaning of yoga the Artmore the soul with Divinity 2 but with Bhagavad that's the real yoga that's when the yoga means to come together but in the original tax in the original ancient teachings of upanishads Bhagavad Gita it's all about is here I am lost in a crazy plan I'm driving my car everywhere how to keep it on the road and where do I go and that's that's that's the classical concept of what yoga is it's all about is here I am lost in a crazy plan I'm driving my car everywhere how to keep it on the road and where do I go and that's that's that's the classical concept of what yoga is keep it on the road and where do I go I like that way of looking at it</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> starting a friend of mine about impostor syndrome the Imposter syndrome depression now you get it when like when people think that you're really good at something and you don't have a lot of self-worth or you you have this perception of yourself that you're not worthy right now like maybe as an artist it did that's that's a big one that you have it as an artist I got it forever as a comedian and I probably still have it a little bit but less so Than I Used to Be I'm just more accomplished in more understanding of what it is and the more engrossed in the process and I know what it is now more than I did before okay and you buy Grammy famous people they know who I am I blood call I got to get out of here I am things happen will you go you know what I think I might be legit I think I might be legit like this is so crazy like I thought was imposter forever but I think I'm going to relax and just concentrate on the work and not worry about whether or not I'm an imposter anymore and I concentrate on the work that you guys always there is often more prevalent and people were legitimately talented and for some strange reason because when you're intimately talented one of the ways you become legitimately talented is to be ruthlessly self-critical cuz that's that's how you get really good at something and then Ruth was self remember Katt Williams was talking about himself once and Katt Williams is a crazy person but a brilliant comedian and he said something that I have always thought and he's like I'm not a fan of me and it goes It goes like I don't you know I don't particularly like me and I was like that is why he's great because that makes you work so hard at like the worst thing a comedian can be in the beginning is sure of themselves and then incompetent the same time it's horrible it's horrible because you're not good but you think you're amazing and then you understand you don't know why the world doesn't think you're amazing because you think you're good cuz you're delusional you have this sort of Art official image of the world that you've put up an in the world you are the center you are the center and you want everything to evolve around you in the worst thing in terms of for comedy you people have to enjoy what you doing they have to enjoy and not not everyone's going to you're always going to have some people don't join no matter what but you're trying to make it an enjoyable experience for the people watching it now if you are delusional clueless and if you you don't understand how people see you you you have a distorted perception of reality distorted perception of your own your own your own presents if box up the vibe for the audience at Fox updated date they recognized it to quickly because comedy in a weird way is a spiritual Pursuit for the person is making it because you're putting together thoughts and ideas and your trying to get it into these people's minds in a way that elicits a response that makes them feel good and the only way that you could really do it is you have to hit those notes you have to reach that that residents have to find that frequency whatever it is that works on them and you can't be thinking about yourself too much in you can't be pleased with yourself can be happy with yourself you always have to be analyzing you are for the sculptor you have to be critical always have to and so in doing that it's really easy to develop imposter syndrome cuz even when you think doing well you know what you had like your ego won't like your mind understands that you Eagle will f*** this up if you if you let your ego say on the f****** man you're going to ruin this whole thing but you have to give to be aware with this is like this this this ride requires you to stay within a certain frequency you have to stay inside that frequency as soon as you start going yet pleased with yourself I think you've gone for a full circle back to the bog of agita cuz the bog of agita is the Warriors have to fight the war you think you think the barbecue is going to be like here's Krishna telling Arjuna not to fight just want to fight service and I think when I apply that type of teaching to my life I sometimes I'm not a great singer I'm not a great you know Indian classical music but I'd like to do it and I'm enthusiastic too and to me it's not about me it's about like sort of like an offering it was in the ashram was when you're onstage don't do it to make sure you're doing it to serve God and not be God that statement changed my entire life and I was like everything I do is to be God everything have you heard kirtan no it's so interesting when is it it's it's it's it's chanting back a call-and-response chanting chanting mantras and use like this pump piano and Indian drums play some free later and then I play the harmonium worship on piano and we just sing publicly call and response and all the Indian people will come around and I'll sing with us since it's like it's overwhelming so there's one particular Temple I go to and one particular holy place where singers come from around the world it's like basically in a Rolling Stones Led Zeppelin it's like the best kirtan singers around the world, and they sing and I remember one time I came with a bunch of students of mine and they called me up to sing and in my brain I was like you guys are like the real deal I don't want to sing another no you sing no seriously I don't want to sing please you sing and like thousands of pilgrims come in at the time and somehow I have felt like I have to do this I have to sing because that's what they're ordering me to do I have to do it in a loving way to do in a way to make everybody excited I can't do with any Eagle whatsoever and it becomes like this incredible tightrope-walking can I do my best with can you get onstage it's not about me can I do the offering where I feel like people are going to walk away with something and I got to be changed a little there going to be lifted a little they're going to go home a little bit more connected it's going to help me instead of helping them and can I do it when we have this thing we say deflect our praise you let Grace your great yoga teacher student your great yogurt that was a great thing you did a quick answer is by the mercy of my teachers like we don't want to hold on to praise God praise exacerbates the ego of the teachers in my life all the people that love me care for me people that like screwed with me but they also taught me a lesson so the Yogi's conception is everybody is creating what I am and therefore I don't own any of this You Want To Praise me going to give the praise back to my teacher at a teachers mood is by the mercy of my teacher I look at back at my life and I realize I'm just like a ball of energy and generally the energy goes to like feed my ego feed my ego set to manipulate girls trip to people like me how can I use everything I've got gifted for my own self aggrandisement and so when you get these teachers in your life spiritual teachers who sort of like give you a loving slap or a living hey and they turn you on in some way they take what you already have and they redirect that North instead of South everything I was doing was just a snowballing devastation and now you can you don't you don't give up those qualities that you have but you use them in a way to bring people up is going to bring some down that's what we're saying about movies to or any entertainment or sounds in our mind that state of mind with no ego that's exactly the the frequency that you have to hit when you doing comedy you do your best but you don't do your best of the people love you you do your best cuz that's what you're trying to do crap that's your that this is your thing your thing that you do your your expression your art form you have to manage it and the way the manager correctly is you hot you can't you can't go out there with ego you'll turn people off they won't feel it yet you know there's moments where you can use that especially with comedy will you turn but even if you're doing it though, you're doing it for the effect of people laugh you're not doing it for the effect of pumping yourself up and you have to be very careful about that if they know that that's what you're doing that will accept it that's that's the art of yes that's the art of it it's a dance there's a strange sort of dance that goes on I would notice this is humiliating to mention but I will if I wasn't doing it in a mood of service as an offering if I got offstage and that wasn't my motivation I've been depressed because maybe onstage on the sensor on the coolest I'm it they're singing song lyrics I wrote on my bed and now they're all singing them and then I'm in another country so if you're not medicating with any type of drug or sex and all you're left with his bunch of emotions and this is why people who are entertainers can can move towards addiction or we are ways to mass that that I think this is why people who are entertainers can can move towards a dictionary us ways to mass that that loneliness that comes with being the center where the whole world is trying to convince you of the Maya you for that we're not at the illusion the illusion of life is that you are the center</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> ending upon your actions you reacted things differently depending upon your physical state and that's one of the things that yoga really helps when one of the ways that yoga helps your karma is Yoga relaxes you two consequences and two things that happen like I remember I was driving on the highway and it was his kid behind me his illegal alien and he was on his phone and he hit the brake relay and slammed in my Porsche have a rare Porsche it's a very nice car and he f***** up my car and I got out and they didn't have a license and insurance insurance card drove I drove it to The Comedy Store but I remember the way I reacted to him cuz I've done Yoga 3 days in a row was cool and calm because he slammed at the time of death that idea I haven't actually had almost near-death experience with this to where you are focused in the same way you're not angry you're not freaking out you become incredibly focused as if I'm about about to leave my body and you can say it once I was attacked and I had it probably the most spiritual experience my life and it was how you attacked such a story but if I was in the show I was with monks we are all monks and we are traveling and we played in sort of a ghetto part of Buffalo and a big show materially speaking it was great we are big people love those who sold merchandise and which band was the shelter and after the show it's about 2 in the morning and everybody's getting out of the club and I'm in the alley getting interviewed for some magazine and our van is parked you could drive a car in the van in the club and all the doors and windows were open and our guys were unloading all the gear and basically only a few people left in the club breaking down the club and I was outside getting interviewed and all of a sudden this car pulls up with these massive dudes who weren't from the they look like just want to get o dudes and they were ripped and they're big and they just grabbed one of the younger kids in our shows level 17 19 20 they grabbed one kit and just beat the living crap out of them and I was like I'm getting interviewed awkward 50 yards away from his randomly random third kid everybody to start running for their life here is like a really don't think of these things like fear and anxiety why don't you do that all I did was I ran back in the club to get my band I said you guys got to get out of here crazy guys outside and all my Roadies Bronx by the way but all the guys were my Roadie said we can't go anywhere in the car start loaded and all the sudden the bad guys there car drives into the club and Parks like like a t blocking our van so we couldn't get out of the club any longer and they get out of the continent not that many people around the club and the biggest guy gets out and grab the gun and he just goes in a really serious and unemotional way I've got a gun I'm going to kill everyone tonight that was one of these like Eerie sort of like Eerie organ music he could hear and I was like it it just felt like oh this is the day and the older devotees will your Krishna devotee monks are bhakti yoga monks and so all the other guys in the van came up to me what we going to do what do they weren't right near us at the time they were like they were literally going around beating people up and all the other monks came out to in a rocket what are we going to do and I had already sort of given up on escaping or anything I just an elevated soul but I said we're going to die tonight and so we're going to chant and I went into the the the price you know what Indian drum and we all started chanting these monstrous to to shrink a Dave was an avatar of Vishnu you usually champer type of protection but we all started really focusing enchanting this monster is unbelievable story true and as they were beating up people they finally came to us and all my guys ran for their life some guys run into the van in the van above the van and I'm surrounded by this gang and the biggest guy just grabbed the gun and he goes to me do you want some freaking trick question and so I just didn't by the way I didn't look like a monk I had jeans on her I didn't it's not like what speed up monk day it was just a random act of violence and so I said I just put my hands like a namaste and said Hari Krishna I'm a devotee of Lord Krishna and I have no idea why you are angry and then for the first time in my life I felt completely helpless repeatedly beaten I just punched and it's just one of those things not like you can even fight back you are just getting pounded but what happened was everytime I got punched iced chanting a mantra so sore like Vishnu Narayan stepping outside myself saying I'm actually in meditation on sacred names and then all the sudden my head was down and I looked behind me and there's these three girls coming to protect me in that baseball bats and then I realized no they're not there the girlfriends of these guys and then I started getting hit by baseball bat unbelievable one of the shoulder in the legs every time I miss is a random thing there's no reason as far as our show is in a ghetto you know there's always a cause of something but I have no idea what the cause was and so every but but miraculously and you read the stories in the Mahabharata rumiano the Great Sage leaves his body in front of him and I'm thinking oh my God I'm chanting these mantras at the time of death I'm shittin chanting at the time of the Perfection of my life that was what was going through my head I kid you not and I was like outside of my body and I wasn't fearful and then all of a sudden to wrap up the story everything stopped and I didn't really know what happened but what was happening was all the guys in the band jumped in our car van and plowed through their car and took off and I can't remember how but I ended up in the street and some ghetto street carrying the Indian clay drum I look like the movie Carrie girl is covered in blood and blood for my head all the way down all over the drum and I'm walking in the streets trying to flag down a car cars with slow down see me because I looked like a zombie or something and then I realized something and you know you're running sort of high on adrenaline I remember being very lucid and I went over to some light I saw look like a garage where they fix cars or house buses or something but it was open and there's a man in a booth and I said so you have to call the police cuz I thought my friends now we're getting beat up or killed or whatever and I said you have to call the police my friends are in trouble and they kind of literally looked at me and just said I'm busy and I said listen you got to call the police right now and if you don't mind I'm just going to hide in this booth cuz I think these guys might come back and kill me and so I'm kneeling down in this dirty garage at 2 in the morning the first thing in my mind is no one knows where I am my mother doesn't know where I am friends don't know where I am my band members on the Wareham they can be getting killed and everything was so good today like I had a great day and now it's over like a dream that I even have these lyrics are like this world's like a dream it's not what it seems we think it's solid but it fade as like I even myself talk became a prayer I start saying I really wasn't expecting to die tonight but that's what the dream is it seems real and now it's over and I started to think like oh my God I was sort of like an estate of like somebody when I was getting beat up I was focused I was connected and I was chanting at that time I said but now maybe my I'm just trying to think my my female Boy Scout first aid is like I might have a concussion my brains going to swell I'm going to fall asleep and then I won't be in meditation and I started saying I said I said I started praying sincerely Krishna I wasn't expecting to die tonight but you were so kind considering I'm not evolved to enter my lips so I could just chant so please don't let me die with concussion if you want to take me please take me right now with all sincerity I started chanting these prayers that I have memorized is very beautiful prayers from a ancient book but their prayers Focus the picture of Krishna in my mind and I started chanting and then unfortunately I lift unfortunately cuz I was so there was no book there's no teacher there's no pilgrimage there was no that taught me more about Mike my spiritual path and met than that beat down day cuz I felt like you were dying close to dying as you can get it accepted it like in that time of great tragedy I've felt connected more than I've ever been connected and I wouldn't wish it again but I'm so happy it happened</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> this fight Companion podcast on Saturday night Saturday during the day via fight the fighter from New Zealand UFC fights before the Tyson Fury boxing Deontay Wilder fight and we were talking about it and my friend Eddie was like how come they don't do something like this on TV and they couldn't there's no way would drinking we have whiskey were smoking weed we're talkin crazy s*** you know British of every girl has asked me crazy but it gets means if you so it's one of those things were like if a network had a show like that they'll be like it is a hit for a sports show that's why Sports show to get way more views than the actual show its watching through the fight companion were watching the fights and we're talking about the fights but that gets more than twice as many views is the actual fights itself which is kind of crazy half-in half-out people were talking about before the really could work at the Discovery Channel or the History Channel to trying to cute and things I've tried to take the edge off with guys we're going to cut that sack when I when you talk about those girls asses it's just kind of disrespectful and bone arrow freedom speech was in the air and that's why whenever we were right something it all had to be legally approved I got the first time I saw that it's not like you said like but but when you guys can just say whatever you do you understand now it down this few voices is possible to have control like this this is you and me and and Jamie's hanging out three man crew that reaches millions and millions of people that's insane but that's the thing that's ever happened before but that's the only reason why it works yeah because you don't have any drugs and violence only difference is that I enjoy yeah it's a Hunter bow hunt animals you know that's what I eat all the time you know I'm always swearing don't believe in any of these things when you when you putting together a show there's no way you would ever let a person like me be responsible for the the the job of of promoting something to like being the captain of a ship are you going to all these Executives and their jobs are on the line and you going to have some loose cannon like me who's a wild stand-up comic my everything I've done has been wild from the beginning from fighting to getting the stand up from its wild his wild stuff that's what I like what I talked about with b******* about life about politics about the state of the way human beings communicate with each other a couple of people when you boil it out especially guys like you and me more comics you talk real about stuff who aren't scared of saying their flaws aren't scared of saying where they f***** up and how you know it's do some of my favorite conversations and when you talk about this this s*** you fuxked up when you were young and dumb stop yeah they don't like it they don't like to feel like they're inadequate or or that they were taking feel like they were always good at this kind of thing where you doing a podcast this is I think this is the future of all those talk shows those talk shows are dwindling they are like they're like flowers in the desert man they're not getting enough water there's no one watching the numbers like Conan show it's horrible and you know he's a legend are the legends but there's no one's watching that s*** anymore because you can watch this or any other podcast is something like nine hundred thousand of them and you could watch them or listening to them anytime you want we could stop it when you have to take a s*** you can come back you know you don't have to wait for it to come on you. None of that you can watch it on your computer or real wheel information for you to get spoonfed nonsense on television you know what those like when I watch those CBS shows like those two crime shows on my old people watching this right old people and people that like have chemicals at work and they did come home drunk you know I mean like the something about it something in the air like a spoon fed to them you don't even like the something about it something in the air like you just want to sit and have something mindless spoon-fed to them it's just those network shows that's what keeps those things alive</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I wanted to come I wanted to tell you I got I got beef with Malcolm Gladwell you spoke to him connect us and then he was a little tipsy but he was talking about how he could do stand-up doing stand-up is easy is nothing but any intellectualizing it's a certain set of thing in the room drinking and a charger like in and I want him to feel it like I want him no and so I left might just not understand what it is I want him to if I want him to I like I want to take him to a black from mowing the grass tastes like the real is when we don't even know old man don't do that. He was like but this is what I've been saying for a while if you talk to someone a lot of people have been funding their life most people said something funny and everyone can talk right so all you're doing up there talking and you say something funny Gino know if you've ever seen this but there's a lot of people that are needy podcasters or they do other things and then they're doing stand-up occasionally because their crowd yes and they think they're doing good stand-up but then they'll go on in the store and look at the sandwich into a lineup in the OR of murderers and then it's ugly it gets ugly cuz reality sets it cuz they're all there to see you and they're all your fans they paid money they just want to see you say there's the guy from the show ye these large audiences these probably said some funny things so probably thinks that he can do stand-up funny guy but when he got out only truly appreciated by people have done it like truly appreciate in terms of with actually happening and it took me years to realize that what was going on when you killing is some sort of a form of hypnosis there's at the mod. The audience is letting you into their mind and they letting you think for them that's why when you have clunky s*** or you blow yourself up or you you have a distorted perception of yourself or give to any words it's like a it's frustrating it's hard for people to absorb you lose some of that group that you have on them but when someone has economy of words and they lock in and their jokes are tight and then they keep going and going through the lost lost in their thoughts I love it I just go along with them that is so much more to it so many element that's crazy man when he was dissecting stuff and you know he's a brilliant guy overestimate their perceptions they they they overestimate their their ability to break something down gas Linda I don't like I've had conversations with people about fighting that way where do people say hey if anybody ever came out to me I would do this and then I would do that yeah people this idea cuz the person moves in a way that's similar to the way that they can move a thing I could do that with weights a f*** that guy up they have these ideas and they think I'll he's out there talkin I'm smarter than that can we found it he was feeling song is him and another guy talking about jobs that are really hard and he picked stand-up comedy and there's a couple quotes that guy defended Center, very well it seems like but is this something that you and I couldn't figure out where drunk so it's really easy yes they like there was the room is set up for them to coming to see them so it's easier he just doesn't know like he's got a very singular you must have been like one or two stamps from him Dave Chappelle did 10 minutes. There could f****** love not having a heart attack scene mediocre thoughts get past off in the audience laughs like this certain clubs I don't want to mention any names but you can go to them any night of the week in Burbank or North Hollywood dogshit comedy and people laughing their laugh and it's like real clunky low-rent what if that's the only animal that's what he was like a nose ring this a difference between talking about any sport right you could watch someone do it poorly on a playground or you can watch someone do it exquisitely as a professional and he go oh oh here it is Gladwell stated comedians deal with people in a tightly-controlled imagine an easier circumstances for navigating a social situation and that of a stand-up comedian they go to Vegas they go to The Comedy Cellar they control their environments and this this is from Malcolm Gladwell fail stand-up comedy 101 Nathan timmel., he's right in a sense but doesn't understand is there's a mind wrestling what's going on before you actually go and do that and to sort of diminish the difficulty of that just shows that you haven't done it as what it felt like cuz I couldn't I couldn't because he said it in the same exact voice he says everything else is so when he's breaking down something that I really wanted him that said he's so brilliant and so many different ways you couldn't shake it off that 10000 hours what you really want is not just numbers it's numbers of like passion numbers of focus year he's wrong he's wrong but but I get it I can't why you think it has it is a tightly controlled environment but it's so easy to bomb in that tightly controlled environment. No idea it's not just numbers it's numbers of like passion numbers of focus yeah yeah he's wrong he's wrong but but I get it I can't why you think it has it is a tightly controlled environment but it's so easy to bomb in that tightly controlled environment. No idea</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> Platinum 34 yeah yeah so yeah I did I didn't really do any sports after I guess middle school and rear Middle School through high school to college and then after college I didn't do s*** like stick figure your leg just soft girl is a really weird so like when people see me now they like holy s*** like Ian really like soft-spoken cuz you're very funny on Twitter I was never like the popular kid by any means so workout Yazoo I just got a married and and I also had an office job I was working at an animation studio and before that I've been bartending so I was like moving around and doing stuff and I never really felt like an active but once I quit the bar job and was just doing that full-time I just felt like fat and lazy and greasy and everything I mean you know you like you do also at the shed outside of this Justin like you know stay happy fear of death and the attitude of the finite life being insignificant that the like what is the point of existential angst that many of us struggle with right right that's something that you touch upon really early on that this this thing that makes us unique is that we know that we're going to die yeah yeah that that to me is the vital distinguishing feature of our species you know we can reflect on the past we can think about the future and recognize that we're not going to be here in the future is for some. Of time and it's it's an idea and it's powerful motivating influence is one that has been explored throughout the ages aderonke was one of the early Disciples of Freud who ultimately broke with Freud develop this thesis that our awareness of our own mortality as one of the driving factors in what we do and then when I was I don't know was in my twenties or thirties I read a book by a guy named Ernest Becker called denial of death I know if you've ever heard of this book it was and it's a wonderful distillation of this way of thinking about why we humans do what we do and I'm anyways you my own book the one that's coming out today you until the end of time it's some it's extending this notion that Becker developed in denial of death but now seeing it in a cosmological setting because it's not just we that are going to die it's every structure in the universe is going to disintegrate in time are our best theory suggest was it even protons the very heart of matter their Quantum processes that in the far future will ensure that are proton disintegrates falls apart into its constituent particles and that point there's no complex matter around at all what would it would timeline we talked a long time for to try to give you a feel for the X involved I like to use the Empire State Building and imagine that every floor of the Empire State Building represent to duration 10 times out of the previous floor to like on the ground floor it's like 1-year first floor 10-year second 400 go for it so you going exponentially far in time as you climb up the Empire State Building and in that scheme of things everything from the Big Bang until today you're about at the 10th floor 10 to the 10 years 10 billion years and as you go forward you are looking at things very far in the future and to answer your question we think and I_think because we're now at the speculative end of our theoretical ideas protons will Decay roughly and say by the 38th floor the 10 to the 38 years and I got a phone call be a buddy of mine from college connect me to this this guy just Icelandic I've never met him before his name is beyond Paul don't know what store I do now is an absolute Legend and he says hey man you were just in Antarctica right and I was like yeah he's like I think we should go back to Antarctica and I was like all right well what do you think he's like in a rowboat I think we should rub a boat from the southern tip of South America to the peninsula vanorder lacrosse Drake Passage how far is that about seven hundred miles and I said please delete my stomach 700 miles rowing a boat in the world you know you've gotten the Atlantic and the Pacific and the Southern Ocean kind of all conversion between an artic peninsula in the southern tip of South America so you got 40 foot swells you got no crazy waves where did he get close to Antarctica and the the mission of the goal was to see if we could there it is right there that's it all the way through to that year but it was it was a two-week r12a Crossing so in the two weeks you had to have two weeks worth of food how about yes oh well water actually we have a desalinator so off of off of solar panels everything seems so where is Noah going to engine no se or nothing like that should complete human-powered romwe have a portable desalination how big is it fits inside 125 feet long 3 Guys running time for six of us total in the team ultimately barely anywhere to sleep in the tiny little compartments like the size of like you know sleeping in the back of a you know hatchback Honda Civic or something like that but but yeah so that's basically kind of in 1 essential compartments was probably like I don't know maybe 2ft by 2ft square or something like that and he doesn't doesn't make a lot of real fast you make 10 liters of water in like you know an hour or two depending on the table month House of Fun is good but let me get the done yeah I guess it done cuz it tastes like whale dicks it got real salty like it wasn't doing quite as good of a job the water on near Antarctica was like one degrees Celsius is 33 Fahrenheit in practically Frozen cold water and I think that was kind of starting to tweak out the system they don't want my money they don't want anything I have to offer them I want what they have that was sort of a game changer moment for me I want to figure out how to be connected with nothing what did these guys do all day spiritual path but later I started doing my next band because the interesting thing about Vegeta Adidas you're familiar with its one chapter of the biggest epic in the world the mahabhart and it's a it's the most studied and discussed and commented on by all the saints of ancient India people even bring it to politics and stuff but it's a real conversation between the spirit and divine Divinity that's a conversation about it just about is just what it's just considered ancient wisdom so the one of the ideas of the Gita is you don't give up what you're born to do you do what you do but in a spiritual way you don't try to like wipeout your desires it's not going to happen you take what you do and you do it in a way that is going to assist you and your Liberation and is going to assist everybody else so I'll say I love comedy but I want comedy that uplift me and not. degrade me I like entertainment that when I walk away from it I learned something I feel like I'm growing I feel connected I don't want stuff is going to just give me darker thoughts like the Joker and I've never seen it didn't say I want to say that I live in a farm a little farm we're are I really want anything except comedy comedy important but I don't watch so much TV somm pretty and I do go to the movies movies it's out of like with my wife let's just we want to get away from the kids and want to do something but there's no plan on what to watch but I'm open to good idea so Jokers are really good movie but it's really dark it's really dark you walk out of there feeling really confused I feel like that I like that I don't know if I like that I know it was awesome I know it was really well done but I like that but there's no plan on what to watch but I'm open to good idea so Jokers a really good movie but it's really dark really dark you walk out of there feeling really confused but I feel like did I like that I like that I know it was awesome I know it's really well done but I like that</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> it would go fight man got to go to the theater major he's dramatic and he's pissed here we go now Brian give me give me your assessment you think Felder I'm going to just go with Felder because he always always is in the fight and he's always his friend he's a giant fan of that Loki check and we go interesting interesting set up he's hit like 4 or 5 low calf kicked hooker has four already don't talk to me that left hook don't sleep on Felder Felder the f****** tank at nothing about tout Felder he's really big for that division he was walking around 190 lb hookers body is so weird it's got like big ass f****** shoulders and big ass bicep it's almost like they're PreSonus shop all over it with hookers dicks and I don't know who hooker is chop a tree down guys fight and eventually just crumbled doesn't make a try to Felder knows that and Felder knows that he went toe-to-toe with Barboza and he's got that in the back of his head packable Founders 1-5 in a row has arguably top two or three best striking coaches on planet Earth Rufus is a f****** machine strongest f*** bro he's a big fella when he's walking around in between fights like how the f*** do you ever make 155 very interesting Sam's if your hookah flavor hookah finish be worried that Barboza stopped felt that bubbles of stop hooker but they're felted beat barbeau's in the rematch and he went toe-to-toe with them the first fight as we did by the way by the way fight oshit ook hooker with a low kicks especially the low captive but that's not enough Fellowes going forward Dollar Store more hands Live account really kicks is the jab locate Gabby round by round fight and let's see if Elder ones out but here's the thing about those kind of swollen eyes if they have a good cornerman they always do and they have ends well they can put that s*** aside to move it a little bit Hanson Tire second-round interview just jumped out really well mashvisor 7 especially when Felder understands how significant that is as as does hook with him and he's a scary engage waiting for Tony perkis Mavericks that right leg in and that he's got the seat belt in a fool and you know what he could pull him back into the truck if you knew that, if he took his right ankle and went behind filters that I don't know who I would collapse him but you have to be really confident when you run games long as f*** felder's left ankle battle collapse wanted to his throne song you got to be comfortable with the truck game if you're if you're not you're not going to do it you're not how it feels to feels awkward 2 minutes ago you know if judges are man especially dangerous weapon Brian if you're watching this fight was Stallone like you should watch your fights what's that sound like just a few questions did not like it he did not like yourself but his nose is a mess anyway all that will be clipped them a little bit of a stumble of legs the other two but s*** three more f****** around cuz it's so good man we got 30 seconds can you get me to give it to you it's close to close up the first half looked at the position on the back control the outside landed but I don't contact picture on hookah which is very rare he's at going after hooker but not not tactically like Barboza but like super aggressively like in your face the founders mind so f****** strong what are things about him that's so interesting is he such a smart articula guys a great commentator but behind that instead Inferno you know there's something going on inside the guy said whatever is going on in his head is dark huh woohoo that left hook is dangerous and hookers not picking his f****** right hand up his hands a super-low a lot of the time a lot of time does he's being a pest volume hey dude, they're doing more damage in this for a hundred percent he's also throwing for the hooker in the pocket he knows felder's coming back with missiles that job is so nice to everyone that left hook nose ones over Austin Powers film set it up with the problem is his powers being stifled by the fact that Felder so aggressive and threatening it makes you think imperfect look at that I just see a red mess I'll see any pulled back out of that kick is Wild is the high-stakes bucking game here kids cuz you do this weekend what happened to though so far hooker has this round yeah Vine but I would say this round is pretty clean ready when you got felt if you want yeah I filled up to 141 this round is that supposed to gender in New Zealand and there in New Zealand Yule and I looked over Dominick Cruz and his jaw dropped when I exercise until like what Hooker Hooker has huge used to fight 45 which is this crazy it's undeniably let's see who's forcing himself himself on hooker light em up looking BCI work somebody's bad at 3 everyday in practice turning hooker around high-level wrestler that kept taking him down that he couldn't stop to take down a stupid question can beats X be happy as f*** repeat it would never do that right right I would never do that like that would never take khabib off the f****** fendt I hate when retirees break up fights on the fence and I hate when they break them up on the ground and no people disagree with anything to make it a fight boring aggressive heat on them you know this isn't just like he's catching them with s*** he's pressing him and he's getting in his face and he's making it real not good. Good oh big elbow this is a big round for a championship Round Here by the elbow singing is round it made you go around the guy in the position to hookers in would win even if he got tattooed a couple times now and against the fence I got dumped off that ran in Houston that gave all four rounds of dominant over to Jon Jones overtime to call I watched it five times and I watched it two times the next day and then I washed it three more times since the third round is the only confusing around it's a little dicey face and I also feel like John want with the dominance of Championship 100% but then towards the end okay that's clear yeah okay that's why I wanted when you look at the numbers to some people may give the first second round a hooker then you get that trailer back to Hooker this could be a tax dollars at 54th and 2nd some idea but it is possible that bad judging leads to other people going well you don't think will accuse are going to give hooker 4 rounds to want you no matter what happened I think so yeah I'm holding the other guy can you prove that he's controlling do aggressive moving control Aerosports if we don't do any talk about it the child is got to get out of see the reason why hookers doing this is because the other s*** is not work and he's losing me that you end up getting what hookers doing at this point where exactly happened so this is where I can handle now though. do they belong and 170000 real similar sites not just all biceps who would throw Lee left hooks instead of a job I'll tell you what your boy hookers getting tired well so looking for the takedown tell me was it being ashamed to come down now bothers me man you got to give this to felt no no no no Xbox right now and you had a pic it wasn't working but no it was so close it was so tight it could have gone either way because the guy down. Got him in the most right now V I was just as boring as the first Ian Happ Titanic from what is Dan hooker gets decision decision give us some volume one you weren't score in the fight to get raped he's going to give it to Hooker to give it to the guy who's looking the best at the end can you disclose a might be in for him he said wow and like her that was a fight that was about as close as you can get and Hardy saying thank you to him no no no no nobody regular basis the guy behind him a stiff breeze put him in a coma</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> everybody says white sponsorship hey are you working with Tony we've been preparing for a long time but we were preparing for him but we were also preparing for the worst case he's probably the best wrestler ever Wright visitor challenge ever for an MMA for 10th Planet that's for sure this is the worst case scenario that I've been talking about this is what I prepare for every me personally my Abu Dhabi is at the gym when we have drop-ins and since 2003 and who knows is going to drop in that night and challenge me so my I always prepare for the is there some drop-in is 190 who wrestle this whole lied I really didn't get to and what am I going to do with him that first round and round we go with probably one round maybe two I'm just I'm just focusing on stuff that he's never seen cuz I come at him with stuff he seen then that's not a good that's not a good strategy, I'm going to pull them into some some Uncharted Territory and that's what we're doing that's what I've been doing with Tony is prettier in Uncharted Territory you know the thing with khabib khabib is undefeated no doubt one of the best fighters probably of all time you know what I mean it wasn't that easy to take down you know and Tony you know you when you compare like you know the Conor fight with khabib you know everybody know that you can watch that I'm only giving away stuff that you can watch out you know where everything's going as well and when they are halfway back up there's that look and then they're back on the fence there's that position that look so when it comes to khabib it's going to be the hardest challenge ever write for sure for sure but the advantage that we have is we know exactly where the fight is going to be if khabib gets like in and out of 56 S1 we know where the fight can be you know I'm the one thing we don't know it how is it going to look at it going to look like you know khabib has his way and passes Tony's card like he has against the other opponent or is it going to be like Gleason to Bowers having a hard time taking him down and he's having his never get inside control never passing the guard against Gleason is it going to look like that how is it going to look at look so many different we'll never really know until they match up don't rely on out late but I will I will promise you this is we got all sorts of landmines waiting for you and we know where the fight where he wants to take the fight and there's going to be some traps there all sorts of them and no one knows about them we're not talking about it but we've been working on this for for a while Tony has so many goddamn weapons Somas utility leading the fight winner was covered in sweat and blood like Barboza yeah yeah is one of those techniques that is you could learn really but learning parties easy as part of learning how to do a d'arce the darkest everybody knows the dark every Grappler Abu Dhabi in the like the last Abu Dhabi 2019 every Grappler on the card knows how to do a darn thing on a TQ they could do a seminar but no one did it only one guy that Ruto load one of the Rotolo twinsies from that guy in the strategy is not like a thing thinking about consciously it's in his DNA but they're probably does because he's always he's looking for it subconsciously it's in a strategy it's in his DNA that's how that's how Tony is Tony man. We're not here but we're working on it even more and making sure that if khabib is caught in one of those things were making it so we're making sure that that thing is Emporia, Nike 18 does it have them in a guillotine for his black belt to intuos Tony's cardio is just ridiculous now literally ridiculous cuz he'll have a crazy super-high fast-paced fight and you look at him he's not even breathing heavy his stomach's not even wheel of hand and he throws elbows more than your average UFC fighter a few times I think those are classic kind of guy who knows he loves you ones then who know they match up just so well together please gods of War get them together in April Lysol Tony jumping a balancing pole United say something like tell me when Tony trains are so he's extreme and now he's super into make sure the NBA would I be doing those arms do horses come in from everywhere posters made up again the posters though I opposed to gives you a hard-on all you need this grounding pounder right took out Connor took his ass out f****** everybody up and then here comes Tony the f****** wild Enigma be coming at you from a thousand different angles and chills but just to the great fight Kevin Lee spinning elbow and then he threw another one right after nuts that's one of his. That's one of his most powerful weapons is that he doesn't he does not hesitate to pull the trigger he's never cautious not a lot of guys you know you hear about these guys I put the goal is to take what he does in the gym and out to the ring that's the goal we could do that he's going to be unstoppable from day one he was revealed anything he doesn't the gym he's going to do in the ring no hesitation you know what I mean there's he doesn't ever hold back I'm pulling the trigger the very exciting fight the Best Buy</div>

I don't know about that he whines up with a f****** one of the all-time great boxing coaches particularly for the mind and Teddy Atlas when he was young and his prom is also an amazing boxing coach and he's up in the Catskills where he's up in the mountains in this secluded environment so we can concentrate only on boxing he's getting hypnotized and he's watching Jimmy Jacobs has this insane Library fight everything from Jack Dempsey to Joe Lewis Derrick Henry Armstrong watch the all-time great he's watching like all this black and white footage Jack Johnson under hypnosis day heavyweight boxer ever you didn't you think that hypnosis stuff actually worked for sure other people real monster who's incredible man no one can sustain the kind of pace that he kept up on our way early days but man when he still maintained when he fought Marvis Frazier those are scary the heavyweight has ever been as scary as a heavyweight what's up I'm sure he's a hypnotist he's also a commentator is afro that's by far the worst do Mike Tyson was just destroying people back in the day just destroying people it was a different time then he won the title it was a different heavyweight division before him was Tyson in it that I think you would be would never ask him McNeely the same thick Duty Fallout 4 tell me the funniest taken out tomorrow's smart tomorrow's smart said he was doing this thing with Mike Tyson signed out because he was it's like you sitting next to a lion and it's like that's really Mike Tyson it's like a lion's there always been free to find out anything I'll sweat and he's so out of it like a medication is like is he a drugged-up lion at that day the date that one Robin Givens and then they broke up never probably married right they get married to your married and then after they got divorced he said he was apparently still banging her every now and then and then he shows up and like Brad Pitt's with her do his mind can I leave</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> which we do a teacher training yoga training in India every January I just got back from a song on your Instagram music school work study Indian music and kirtan we have a 300 hour training for people who are teachers and we have a sacred literature if you study the Bhagavad Gita in all these sacred texts before the podcast of the Bhagavad Gita and of the Mahabharat all the the ancient Indian texts which are filled with really wild out there s*** you know I mean sorry Ana's feels like that I can't say real but I could I could understand how things can be made of subtle energy explain V monster a spaceship spaceship from and they speak of spaceships and flying crafts but they're not made of the same elements of this Earth they suffer from the same things people who claimed abduction it's not like a type of neurosis or skip the they suffer from like post-traumatic stress syndrome like they do you remember the story of Betty and Barney Hill now it's the most famous abduction story it was an interracial couple from my thing was a 1950s or 1960s and just random my interviews always go here this girl on the podcast this woman on the podcast yesterday she's an MMA fighter and it was Angela Hill she's a couple days ago actually this badass MMA fighter at the end the podcast goes I forgot to bring this up but my grandfather is Barney Hill house like that guy I'm like no f****** way that guy Barney Hill was the very first like really public UFO abductee and there's record any jobs Kraft that's eerily similar to the crafts that Bob Lazar described and different people described in the he and his wife lost time while they were driving and then woke up with these bizarre horrific memories that they both shared of this encounter with these space beings and that they were abducted and the medical examinations were run on them then they were replaced with missing time and it's do you listen to recordings of him being hypnotized and going through it like two screaming in fear that they're touching him in the where they taking and what are they doing to him it's not like a guy acting it's not like a scene right movie with someone screaming in fear it sounds real and I to the teachings of ancient India is that life exists on all planets it even exists on the Sun as of the first arguably like, they just don't have bodies of a fire body therefore I'm trying to look at how does a person with earth and water body live in the sun they can't you have to have a body like 13 years old what am I missing what sense am I missing that I can't have objective reality in a what am I missing in my missing a sense why you have this principle called the fart Theory like if someone but you didn't never knows you have no idea he'd have no idea of knowing that you possess that allows you to regret recognize something that's invisible you can't see it you can't feel you can't hold it there's not there you don't there's no way of detecting it other than your olfactory senses but through your nose you can detect something awful what sense am I missing LIHEAP in me understanding Ashley reality that's one of the things that you feel when you take psychedelics like this is opening up some new sense that I wasn't with this is around me all the time I'm just not tuned into it because I don't have the right chemical composition flowing through my brain when I start to teach a bigger training to yoga training in philosophy that's one of the things I do mainly I start with this concept of this is how you understand who's here but come on we're adults are my supposed to understand that a elephant-headed man described this entire book can't we just extracted a useful lesson do you know it's really caught me off-guard like what do you actually know right with you know okay suppose 300 years ago you're living in New York your family living in New York your tribe is living in New York you have a certain amount of animals and animals that you keep animals that you ride animals that you hunt foods you eat and then one of you goes on a boat to Africa and you come back and you think you're never going to believe what I saw I saw a striped horse with a white head I saw striped worse if you've never seen a zebra it's almost unbelievable if all you know is ponies run or I saw this horse with a really long neck that ate the leaves on the trees, man it's all fantastic because we've never seen it but that doesn't mean it doesn't really understand The Vedas the teachings of ancient India you have to go into it like not that it's all real Blind Faith but I'm not saying don't be a blind doubter like it could be I don't know but I don't know a lot what do you think that what do you think like Ganesh was arrested being Find Faith but I'm not saying don't be a blind doubter like it could be I don't know but I don't know a lot what do you think that what do you think like Ganesh was arrested being</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Kurzweil is a fascinating character have you discussed any of this stuff with him you know I don't know him personally I have certainly gone to some of his talks and I think he and I had one exchange at some point in the past and I totally get where he's coming from you know he feels that we're perhaps the final mortal generation and how sad it is after you know thousand generations of humans if we could only stick around for one more generation science would come to a point where we would be in mortal and that feels like a tragic State of Affairs I don't think he's right and I think most people who think about this deeply don't think he's right either however many vitamins you take and however much Sciences progressing the notion that we are just a generation or two from immortality at the wishful thinking this is strange concept of immortality to because it's not necessarily you it's a downloaded version of you that will exist in some sort of a computer right which is what does that mean like that sounds like hell yeah it could be asleep in that computer in the world that are hard for us as flesh-and-blood into appreciate this point but it raises the Deep question would that be a good thing and back if you had that opportunity to be downloaded in some form and that would allow you to hold on to all your memories build new memories on top of them have experience and maybe there's an avatar that you're able to drive but through you know your mental machinations is out there in the world would you do it I might have said yes before I've had I'm pretty profound psychedelic experiences and then from then I said I'm going to hedge my bets I'ma see what's next right and see what happens when the lights go out I really think there may be something that happens when the lights go out I don't know I don't know what I mean for sure your body is going to Decay and you are going to become a part of the earth you're becoming part unless they cremate you or unless they embalm you with some toxic chemicals then nothing can use your your dead tissue which is really a shame yet become a part of the earth you're becoming part unless they cremate you or unless they embalm you with some toxic chemicals then nothing can use your your dead tissue which is really a shame that we do that right yeah</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what do you think Consciousness is consciousness is clearly just a factor of brain tissue and an energy or do you think it's possible that what our brain is is something that tunes into Consciousness yeah well I spend some time thinking about this question I think it's perhaps the deepest question that faces size or even Humanity at some level and my own personal purse active is that Consciousness is nothing more than the choreographed motion of particles in Ferris Quantum States inside a Gloppy gray structure that sits inside this thing that we call ahead do I have any proof for that no does anybody have any proof of what Consciousness is not at all at this moment but the history of the reduction is program where we've been able to take some of the more spectacular Creations that have emerged in the and recognize that they are nothing but the product of their ingredients in the laws of physics leads me to extrapolate that idea to the experience of Consciousness and having said that there's a deep puzzle it's called the hard problem of Consciousness which is if electrons and corks and particles and laws of physics are all that there is and if you buy into the fact that electrons don't have an inner world that corks don't have an inner world by taking a collection of those particles you can turn on the lights how can a collection of mindless thoughtless particle somehow yield mindful experience and that's a deep question that science has not yet answered my own feeling is when we understand the brain better that question will evaporate will look at the brain with our new-found understanding maybe it's a hundred years in the making maybe a thousand years in the making aha when electrons and quarks and protons move in this particular configuration one of the byproducts in an inner Sensation that we Call Conscious experience and that to me is a likely answer that we will find but there are some very smart well-respected people who go in a very different direction there are some who say electrons and protons and corks they do have a fundamental Proto conscious quality they themselves are conscious beings of A Sort now it's not like you're going to have electrons that are crying or are quarks that are anguishing but if you have a little Proto elements of conscious experience that is imbued into a particle and then you take a lot of the particles and put them together the ideas that yields the Manifest conscious experience that were familiar with I don't buy into that but white people position on this because I guess my view is you look out at the world and what you do as a physicist is you move the smallest degree required to explain the phenomena that you are observing and to move from our current understanding of the world to LeapFrog to a place where electrons are conscious and corks a conscious to me is such a fantastically radical move that I considerate Justified to make that move with our current level of understanding there was a time back in the 80s when life itself was so mystical that people basically said the same kind of thing how could a collection of lifeless particles ever come together and yield a living thing they said that they can't you have to induce a life-force have to inject vital it have you inject a life force and that's what sparked the emergence of Life on life was part I don't think any serious scientist thinks that today I think most serious honey to say yes life is wonderful life is in some sense miraculous but life is nothing but the particles of nature coming together to yield the complex molecules of DNA and RNA the complex cellular structures the cells come together to yield the more complex multicellular organism and that's all that it takes to have something that's alive no life force is necessary that way of thinking about the world has gone away and I am my own feeling is that that kind of progression is going to happen for Consciousness today it's a really mysterious how it is that I have this invoice talkin inside my head how it is that I look around the world and I can see the color red and I can and I can experience the color red I don't just have sensors that can call that red I mean an iPhone can do that I actually have an inner world where I feel that color red I'm from heart answer that question but I think a hundred or thousand years from now we'll look back and smile at how we in this era invested Consciousness with such mystical quality when in the end it's nothing but particles in the laws of physics and that's all there is to it but what's interesting to to me is that as a human being my my thoughts on Consciousness or are very deep and profound and it is this ideal like what is this thing but if I really break it down actively in animals have some sort of a Consciousness I mean including they have instincts right they there try to get away from danger they try to arrive in procreate and we develop something far more complex and our ability to express ourselves and language and in doing that language during that creation of that language we developed all sorts of bizarre Concepts and we've developed all sorts of different ways to describe feelings and emotions and and contemplate the future yeah well nice things are continually getting more more complex if you go to single-celled organisms work your way up to you know early hominids and then get the human beings you to see this ever increase in form of complexity in every way yes and in the way that the things see the world of course it makes sense that there be more complexity right but we don't think about that we think of a parakeet we don't think of a parakeet is being conscious the parakeet relatively speaking is far more primitive than a chimpanzee which is relatively speaking far more primitive than a human being right and it just going to continue to evolve or if we survive things will continue to improve didn't natural selection and random mutation and all the other factors and will be something that makes this today look like primitive the way we look at single-celled organisms are Champs or whatever I can well imagine that those small changes in that you to type fraction and percent yield a radical change in what they being that has a DNA is able to accomplish but at the same time you you made reference to psychedelic experience yeah and I trust you agree but tell me if you don't that those psychedelic experiences were generated by a slight change in the chemical makeup of the particles coursing through your brain and your body sometimes not even to change sometimes a lot of them right so so to me that's a great piece of data that speaks to the fact that all it is is particles and chemicals coursing through a structure because if the mind was somehow external to the physical makeup in the Walt describing it then how would the injection say of some kind of foreign substance or as you say the brain produces some sort of substance that it didn't ordinarily have within its makeup why would they be able to have such radical impact unconscious experience the way I would look at it if I was trying to argue against that would be that your eyes and the organs of the human eye are taking in light and through that light are able to perceive physical objects in the world that they would not be able to do without light it's something that allows you to see and it allows you to take in depth perception and understand shapes that the human mouth find and particularly these glands that produce the Psychedelic chemicals when experiencing these chemicals it allows the brain to experience things that might be there all the time but that you cannot perceive with normal human neurochemistry that needs to be enhanced or the levels need to be changed and shifted and what's really perplexing about that these chemicals is that these chemicals are produced by your brain and if you do take these like particular dimethyltryptamine what is the most potent of all the Psychedelic chemicals to take that that you have these insanely profound Vision right which is you know leads to a lot of people having he's a religious spiritual epiphanies have you done anyting have you done any psychedelic experiences that you're allowed to talk about I have not not many and I'm a complete lightweight in this Arena because I hardly drink you do I hardly do anything that it puts foreign substance into the body but yeah I was in I was in Amsterdam I was I was there because I was giving a lecture to the queen of Holland and I gave the lecture and my wife and I were both there and after that was over we decided to do a little experimenting and for somebody like me who doesn't experiment I made a mistake because you know who took their like this the easy way in like the video the novice version and it did nothing to me at all that first night so the next night when we went I went right to the bottom of the list where they use sent you was in Dutch or something but it had like machine guns you know pointed out of brain, so I did that version and it was the most terrifying experience of my f****** life we're in a club we're in a club and all of a sudden the world changed and what started happening is my brain started manufacturing versions of myself that would converse with me and convince me that the reality that I was experiencing was real and then that version of me would destroy that reality and the process would start over and over and over again yeah wow Cafe smoked any and I suspect that the impact was because my body has no experience over the impact and you know it was terrifying it was utterly I was in the hotel room and I was clinging to the bed and and I actually said to my wife tie me up cuz I'm like terrified of what I'm going to do right you know what wow you know and and so instead you know she she called the doctor and I was like she was like afraid this would be like in the newspaper cuz I just I get elected to the queen you know but you know they're so used to Americans getting in over their head with this kind of potatoes or something that they were completely used to a doctor and the doctor basically just gives you sugar and my wife knew that this was an extreme because I don't eat any sugar but I was like he said either I was like taking a Milky Way bars like I'm seeing her somehow I don't know I don't know the chemistry behind this but but sugar is the antidote supposed to help but it it lasted 8 hours even flying home on the plane the next day all I did is I sat in my seat and I put on the headphones and there's a Beatles Channel and I just like listen to Beatles proper like April like 7 hours I was just you know in this in this place that I had never experienced before no unibrow conversate you know this just made it so intuitively obvious to me that my conscious awareness is totally dependent on tan on account a few chemicals that's all that's happening inside of the headstone away it was a valuable experience is not something that I don't want to ever experience again absolutely but it was something that help align my tulip understanding of what Consciousness is with the scientific recognition that it all relies upon the stuff that's circulating inside of your mind what's interesting about these heavy-duty psychedelic experiences cuz what you took was in by most people's idea of very mild yeah but profound psychedelic chemicals that are also produced by your brain if you just shift that ratio and not by too much really going to talk about it even tournament little small doses of this stuff shift that ratio it produces these profound Vision dislike Ayahuasca text is Justin Worley active version of dimethyl trip okay and it breaks down dimethyltryptamine and so they figured out how to combine an MAO inhibitor with the leaves of another plan that has the dimethyltryptamine and I said but you can take synthetic versions of it but the Pope this is something that your brain produces your liver produces we know we know it is producing a long that's the body makes it yeah right but it's got its in there but then what what we have now in terms of our balance in our are chemicals must be different than what this fellow must have had yes chimpanzee thing in there but that Fountain also do you have these incredibly profound that yeah yeah it makes you think like what what we have now in terms of our balance in our our chemicals must be different than what this fellow must have had yes chimpanzee thing</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> disparity time meditating I do I'm not particularly effective at it and so people are that way you know but you know years ago Factor once well years ago friend of mine bought me one of these Transcendental Meditation courses and I was like I'm going to actually go and do it and it was kind of eye-opening there was a lot of what you might call woo woo stuff that was happening in the lectures ineffective the guy giving the lecture he did recognize me and you could I could tell how uncomfortable he was giving his normal description cuz he kept looking at me she purposely if you would invoke quantum physics and things are better but the idea of a different mode of operation which is sort of how I summer the experience you know if you're if you're reciting the Mantra in your mind and allowing that to be a sort of pedal-point a driver of how your mind is behaving at that moment that's a very different way of being in the world from thinking about grocery shopping or something Einstein's equation and I think that to me is the value of it it's a systematic way to put your mind in a different mode of operation and at times I find it very useful to move into that place I'm what when you when you start doing Transit on meditation what about it was weird well it was weird with number one was doing this in this in this group setting which is how you start on this course and moreover it being framed in a manner that I had trouble aligning with my understanding of how the world works by virtue of the lectures that were given to us for what it is what we're doing but through the practice I sort of found I'm trying I'm just translating from what they were saying in the lecture into a language that I'm more comfortable with and that made it less weird for me because it didn't make any sense to me and saying hey what is this really about what this really is about is breaking the usual Chain of Thought that is 99.9% of the time of how we live in the world and allowing my brain to have a chain of thought that is artificial cuz I'm sitting here forcing myself to recite this Mantra inside my mind but that's a very useful way of being because it's unfamiliar and it's a novel and allows my brain to operate in a different way so when I translated into that language it all of a sudden it a lot more sense to me and became not weird at all if he came in interesting practice and do you still do it I do it when I feel I needed so either friends of mine who say I cannot live in the world if I don't do my 20 minutes in the morning simply that that's part of my routine I don't feel that way but there are moments when I say whoa I need to do it and basement circumstance based on what's Happening to given moment it allows it kind of mental reset if it's if that's a language that make sense and that reset I consider to be a valuable thing to do I also have a float tank here since I can't go into an MRI machine so I have a desk in my office where it's only about like one foot high and I slide my body underneath the desk close lock the door cuz I'm too weird and I stay under there as long as I possibly could just like 15-20 worst experience my wife might I did two of them last week about understanding I tell really yeah I don't understand why someone as smart as you would not recognize well there's just love sitting around me and I do I do but it's that's like the irrational part that thing I get in there my heart starts to pound when I come from I don't know because it wasn't always there and it had and it has gotten worse in certain there was a time there's actually times when I couldn't even go in a tunnel in a car the claustrophobia was that bad really I was in a taxi cab I had to go to New Jersey to Manhattan so I have to take the Lincoln Tunnel and asset tax is approaching the tunnel I said to the guy I can't do it I can't do it and the guy says blind I can't let you out it's illegal to let you out I said you got to let me out I can't do it and I just open the door and I got out maybe you're too smart can't you waited it there and maybe your Israel is playing tricks with you and giving you anxiety to sort of Shake It Up the world and yeah maybe you maybe the actual scope of the universe I just do a real simple type of meditation when I probably eventually going to take a TM course cuz my friend Tom Papa he's really into TM and heating heat Raves about it yet but when I just sit down and I breathe I just concentrate only on my breath and I ended comes and goes but I concentrate only on my breath and I find really good relief from that yoga is the same thing I do yoga I tried you at least twice a week when I yeah there's a lot of benefit in that in the same way in that it's so difficult and in the poses if you can only concentrate on your breath just balance and concentrate on your breath you'll be filled with activity enough with the with things to concentrate on with the balancing of the posture and then the breath that it is access a sore muscle brain scouring it cleanses the mind of unnecessary anxiety and a lot of other just baby do that for a long time yoga's been I've been pretty steady for the last four years right right and my wife does a lot of yoga she keeps telling me that I need to do it it's great for the body as well and I think the more comfortable your body is the better your beliefs from me instead of my mind Guy</div>

	<div> <a class="links" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHAA_1Guxlo"> What Was Happening Before the Big Bang? w/Brian Greene | Joe Rogan </a>
		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> here's the thing I've always wanted to ask someone like you what do you think was happening before the Big Bang Yeah it's it's a it's a deep question Anna Anna Anna subtle one and they should have two ways that I like to think about that question one is it could be that the Big Bang was an interesting event but not the first event in the totality of reality it could have been the first event that sparked the expansion of our part of but it could be that there's a grander realm of space within which we set as a small part and that Grandeur well may have been there for a far longer. Of time it may have experienced its own big bags maybe a collection of Big Bangs that may extend infinitely far into the past so it could be that the answer to the question what happened before the Big Bang is a lot of other Big Bangs or lot of other Quantum events that were taking place in a larger landscape of reality than we have direct access to however another answer is that the very question may not make as much sense as the words seem to suggest we know how to parse that since we know what it means to talk about the moment before the Big Bang because we know how to talk about the moment before your birth or the month before the Civil War or the month before any event that happened the world we fully understand the meaning of that kind of sentence but it could be that when it comes to the Big Bang the sentence actually doesn't mean anything it could be that the Big Bang the place where time itself started and honking himself had a wonderful and now it's yet to get this across you should look I'll dress it up a little bit imagine you're walking in planet Earth and you pass by someone you say hey can you point me in the direction of North I want to walk in the north which direction to point you continue to walk your path by somebody else say hey which way is further north and they point you in that direction or when you get to the North Pole and talk to somebody there and say Hey how do I go further north they look at you and say well that doesn't mean anything because this is where North Begins there's no notion of going further north than the North Pole and it could be that that spatial metaphor applies to time talk about a billion years ago or 10 billion years ago but if you go to 13.8 billion years ago the big bang that maybe were time started and you can't go further back in time than the very origin of time itself that freaks me out what you mean beginning of time why would time have a beginning good and it could be it could be the time is an emergent quality of reality I give you an analogy boy what I mean by that is we all know what temperature means intuitive like something's hot you feel it something's called you feel that your body understands those Concepts but physics is done is it done deeper into the concept of temperature and revealed that it is no what the average motion of the particles making up the environment so if the molecules are moving really quickly you've got a hot environment if a molecules are really moving slowly it's a cold environment so temperature emerges from the motion of particles have like one particle he can't really talk about it being hot or cold because you need a conglomerate Union agglomeration of particles to be able to talk about their average motion and in that sense temperature is this emergent idea that rests upon more fundamental ideas the molecules and atoms that make up reality maybe that's true of time maybe time as we know it is a property that only makes sense in certain environments when there's enough stuff arranged in the right patterns but fundamentally maybe there are atoms or molecules of time which one not arranged in the form that we are familiar with don't yield time as we know it time itself the equality of the world that exists here in this environment but doesn't even apply in other environments that are configured radically differently than everyone has what caused the Big Bang why would something smaller than the head of a pin yeah become everything that we see in the cosmos yet there are ideas for the answer to that question look all this is tentative hard to do measurements that go all the way back to beginning with astronomical observations that we need to be sure are compatible with the predictions of our theories and so forth so do we is good scientist do what needs to be done to try to test his ideas but the idea that I think most physicists are cosmologist by into at the moment is that gravity can have two manifestations do usual form of crappy that you and I know about is the attractive version you drop something toward the send it moves downward because the earth and the object pull on each other that's the ordinary gravity that we experience every day of Our Lives but Einstein's equations actually allow gravity to also be repulsive it can push outward as opposed to just pulling Inward and this is something that we have never experienced because the gravity created by a rocky object like the Earth is always the attractive variety the gravity created by the sun again Compaq object is always attractive variety but Einstein's math shows that they don't have a a rocky object that's isolated in space but rather energy that is uniformly spread through a region of space that that kind of entity yields repulsive gravity why is that important to your question if the very early universe that little tiny head of a pin you're talking about if it was filled with a uniform bath of this energy week the input on feel the name doesn't matter but it was filled with that energy it would have been subject to repulsive gravity was repulsive gravity do pushes everything apart causes everything to rush outward so the bang of the Big Bang may have been a spark of repulsive gravity operating with a tiny region of space that pushed everything apart and this concept of repulsive gravity is just theoretical and we observed any sort of element in the universe that this theoretical but it's at a level of understanding that I think most physicists would say causes it to migrate into the camp of established understanding of how gravity works the number one Einstein's equations have now been tested over and over again and a whole variety of circumstances the detection of gravitational waves just a couple of years ago is like date the crowning Triumph of Einstein's Matt the hundred years ago the math says baby ripples in the fabric of space a hundred years later we finally detect ripples in the fabric of space so we are very comfortable with any prediction that comes out of Einstein's mathematics and write in the mathematic is the prediction of what I was just a crap you've got uniform energy in a region repulsive Gravity the other thing is we currently witness that the expansion of the universe is speeding up not slowing down since the 1920s everybody thought that yes universe is expanding but it will slow down over time why because gravity pull things back together you throw an apple upward it doesn't go up faster and faster goes up slower and slower because the Earth gravity pulls it back everybody thought that would apply to the universe as a whole it's expanding but expanding ever slower the observations in 1998 culminated in 1998 which won the 2011 Nobel Prize show that the distant galaxies are moving away ever more quickly the expansion of space heating up overtime it's accelerating how do we explain that the best explanation we currently have is repulsive gravity We Believe even today the universe is suffused with a bath of energy we call a dark energy we believe it's uniformly going through space I like to think of it almost like a as a Turkish song that's like the steam feeling the song that this energy feeling space and that repulsive gravity we believe is responsible for the observations that the distance what is a rushing way faster and faster over time so it's circumstantial but the case for repulsive gravity is quite strong and what would have caused the coalit what would have caused it to compress an initially why would all that matter be in this tiny less than a pin-sized I have no idea and nobody else on planet Earth has any real idea other but we do have theories and one of the theories suggest that very early Universe it was a highly chaotic environment very hot with all the field fluctuating wildly up and down and the idea would be that if you wait long enough we're it's hard to know what weight means in this environment but don't press me on my definition of time back then just would have intuitively if you wait long enough on rare occasions the energy will just happen to flatten out in a region become uniform and then that region explosively inflates grows large so you know it's imagine you're looking at about a pot of boiling water the surfaces of course Wylie undulating up and down but if you wait long enough very long time since you've never seen it neither of us by there will be a little patch on the surface of that boiling water that flattens out why that only means that the water molecules happen for an instant to be moving in just the right way to keep that little patch of water from Wylie bubbling it will happen it's rare but if you wait long enough it will occur simile the why the undulating feels in the early Universe if you wait long enough a patch will flatten out you get the uniform energy plug it in time signs equations that region explosively inflate so I mean explosively it can go from a size that's much less than an atomic diameter to larger than the observable universe in far less in a blink of an eye in 10 2 - 32 - 35 II that's how powerful repulsive gravity can be so baffling so before that before this happens you just have in this Theory you just have all of his energy sort of randidly interacting with other energy in the universe with no physical objects yep yep could have been forever Point there's nobody who is hanging around looking at their watch saying good God when is this big bang going to finally happen you know so so you can have this a cosmological pre-show you can have it last as long as you like the only thing that you need to happen is that sooner or later a reason flattens out and then the cosmological show begins and if we're looking at this model of the universe being this infinite universe it was a different characteristics and different qualities to them this could be happening throughout Infinity yeah all over the place and in fact this so-called inflationary cosmology is the technical name for the subject said that it says that it's quite likely that this explosive inflation of the region that we currently inhabit it was just one of many such events and therefore there other far-flung regions throughout the larger cosmological landscape where things have also inflated but the details can be different the physical details can differ from what we are familiar with and the differences can be small temperature differences in one part of space versus another or they can be far more significant even need the particles that make up that other realm may be different from the particles that make up our round their masses can be different or charges can be different their fundamental physical features can be different so out there in that wire cosmological landscape it can be the wild wild west of realities and they don't have to worry about proton deterioration there maybe Realms in which they don't have to worry about protons falling apart the wild the really crazy idea is that if you're very careful mathematically and analyzing these theories you realize that there have to be Realms out there that duplicate horse as well many can be different but there have to be versions of this reality that are also instantiated occur out there and in other Realms so you come to these crazy sounding sci-fi sounding ideas that you and I are having this conversation out there and other distant Realms an infinite number of traps infinite number of times and moreover small differences can also arrive in these other Realms where maybe our positions are interchange at the table or you know maybe your name is you know Joe Greene I'm Brian Rogan or there's like strange realities that can be taken place and this is not an overworked theorists imagination this is the careful dispassionate analysis the mathematical equations implication and say what you guys have fallen off the deep end your theory has imploded because any theory that predicts that kind wealth of realities that are kind of untestable because they're so far away that we will never interact with them that's the kind of theory that we have been trained to avoid to exercise however the more forward-thinking I'd like to describe us business to say hey math has proven to be a very valuable guide over the course of hundreds of years and this is where the math it taking us it's at least worthy of our attention to investigated fully and possibly physicist say hey math has proven to be a very valuable guide over the course of hundreds of years and this is where the math at taking us it's at least worthy of our attention to investigated fully and possibly come to the conclusion that this is how reality actually behaved</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> do you ever listen to music when you're you're pondering an equation or whether you're going over a problem is initially questioned when I was in college I couldn't have any sound on when I was trying to say learn quantum mechanics and relativity I would find that it would capture my brain to fully and I couldn't focus on the equations that I was trying to understand but the funny thing is it in writing this book for the very first time I found that there were passages that I couldn't write if it was quiet I needed to have music playing because in some sent by focusing to directly on what I was trying to say I couldn't say it I only found that I can make progress in certain kinds of description by allowing my brain to fly off through whatever musical experience I was playing and allowing the freedom of thought to then emerge within that unusual for me environment kind of music real doing well it's buried incredibly lot of Slayer I remember there's one vital of patches on his writing words you know Pentatonix the they are a spectacular acapella group who are able to take songs that you have heard in transform them into sort of transcendence performances are you check these guys out but other times you know it would just be old rock loud Beatles loud Rolling Stones the soundtrack from the greatest showman are just blaring that thing and it just allowed me a certain kind of linguistic Freedom that I could not acquire in my normal way of being in the world which has everyone quiet let me just work out my equations and I need total focus and no distraction so is this something that you sort of evolved over the course of your career absolutely not there early on and you know there's this phenomenon I don't know if this is anything more than a metaphor or an analogy but whatever you know there's certain things in the night sky that you can't see if you look at them directly but by looking off access your able to invoke other qualities of the eye that are able to sense those features of the night sky and I kind of feel like it's the same thing sometimes by focusing directly on what you want to do you can't do it and you've got to look obliquely got to look off access metaphorically and that's the only way that you can accomplish what you set out to do and certainly music is one of the ways to take one's attention and shifted in a different direction to get that oblique view of what it is that you're trying to do and I have found that it allows for Progress at otherwise is unattainable and is that the case also when you're reading this book absolutely you know I have a very understanding so we have a house up so you we live in Manhattan you know I'm at Columbia but you would let me go up to our house Upstate with the dogs and by myself and I would disappear for weeks on end and I hold myself up in this cabin in the woods and I would sometimes right deep into the night and there are no neighbors around so I could turn on the music I would ever volume I found useful and I would do it and I would find you know that it's freed up a certain kind of creative thought process that to me was striking because I had never approached work in that way before and it was really deeply interesting so how did you come to this idea of doing it that way I just wanted to say I was struggling on certain things and I felt as though I am approaching this in a very flat-footed way I want to write about this let me know so I want right about human creativity or want to write about religious engagement and I am just doing what I've always done which is I have this equation and I want to solve it so I'm going to bring the tools of mathematics compared to solve it and I was approaching this writing project in exactly the same mind frame and as it wasn't working I said let me smack my brain around a little bit and and so one way of you know it could be psychedelic I didn't go that direction but I smacked it around by myself to be subject to a great deal of distraction in the environment around me and it really made a difference it's interesting you did it in a calculated manner I think when I'm doing mathematics it does need at least for me personally to be that kind of non-distracted total focus on what's going on as a writer it's a very romantic notion to lay out to go to the woods in a cabin that's what's up that's what everybody wants to do that right fight exactly missing is whiskey supposed to get drunk out there to get the dogs I hardly ever drink but it it was an unusual creative experience which to me opened up a different way of going about trying to to create things in the world</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> can you think of human evolution do you ever stop to think what are we going to be like a million years now if we do survive what have you ever done this sort of thought experiment will you say okay if things keep going the same way right we used to be very strong and very hairy and we're getting progressively softer as we don't need to use our bodies as much our brains are getting larger a happy getting bigger do you do you do that sort of thought experiment to see what we're going to be coming not in a systematic scientific way cuz the process is so fraught with Incredible detail that I think it's hard for anybody even experts and evolutionary biology to really tell us anything that will hold water that's really predictive but on a general level yeah I mean because I you know people often wonder why is it that we haven't been visited by aliens right this is something that comes up whenever you're talkin about other life inside the University be quite straightforward nobody out there cares about us because we're so ill developed we're so young on the cosmic seen that there's nothing interesting for them to find here on planet Earth so to me there's a natural explanation for why there can be stuff out of your life out there and yet they don't hang out around planet Earth just way we don't hang around an anthill to try to have a conversation with you know what's going on inside that particular structure I buy that argument the least you do butterflies are so boring where we're just hitting moles where we're interested in the house because we want to see the evolution of development that yields his particular life-form or because it's a general curiosity about how this object is put together if these other beings are so far beyond us at those kinds of tax in in taxonomy questions are no longer of any interest then hanging around here may not hold anything for them to make the journey and stick around long enough for us to notice I don't buy that again for two reasons. One because why would we assume that they're so far beyond us that they wouldn't be interested in these talking monkeys with thermonuclear weapon to dominate an entire planet yeah that would be fascinating the other politicians all lie to themselves everyone gets video through the sky if they fly and Metal tubes that Barrel over the over the oceans write a polluted oceans and eat all the fish like these people are f****** crazy guy who got to go there and check this out but but imagine that this civilization the notion of lording over a planet is like us talking about you know the aunt lording over a grain of sand so they may be lactic as opposed to planetary in her head gemin8 and the notion of some little tiny Rock orbiting some nondescript in the suburbs of this completely ordinary Galaxy off there on the side may not have the kind of pull that you imagine that it does how I disagree we think it's interesting we see a Champions a rock to open up a nut in a week we think it's interesting that you know there's there's an amazing photograph of an orangutan spearfishing of you ever seen it interested in these kind of qualities or a thousand years from now or ten thousand years from now another planet are more than 10,000 years the answer to that is we look at the history of the cosmos until today and it's say let's just calling our University concrete 13.8 billion years at me look at life on planet Earth and that you know a handful of billions of years old billions of years you can go from some complex molecules to human beings it's not that long a few billion years earlier in some other system you know stars and galaxies they were starting up you know a billion years after the big bang so it could be that life in other world has a head start on us by a few billion years and we know what can happen in a billion years ago from single-cell to us and you can imagine from few billion years from now into the future could be radically different so to say it's 10,000 years ahead of us that to me would be the Unexplained coincident how unlikely that they started we start with in 10000 years in the span of billions of years that seems unlikely as it doesn't seem unlikely when you're talking about the infinite size of the universe and is perhaps an infinite number Brian Grainger you're talking to an infinite numbers of me good good point good point that you're right we're almost guaranteed if the spatial expanse of the universe is simply looked at the are going to be places where it's within 10,000 Years War but those are going to be a very small number compared to the places where it's not 10,000 of them what is a look at a finite size ball in this large space so I can so everything's finite now get up 5 billion light-years call the number that are different from us by 10,000 years would be very very small compared to the number differing from us by a billion years were a couple billion years so then we buy the the log numbers if we imagine that the random process some physical principle that prevents life from emerging before say 4 billion years ago and if that's the case we're not aware of that principle then you'd be absolutely right that we'd all be roughly at the same starting point and there's no reason to suspect that they would be so far ahead of us but I don't know of any such principal but you almost have a reductionist view this right like you. So if you had a gas if you had $100 to bet it has alien life ever observed us you would say no vibes we could just turn a big telescope in our Direction and gather some radio waves you know but yes I would take that bet because frankly we've only been generating radio waves for the last you know that 70 years so it's only is 70 light year ball around us and within that small radius very unlikely that there's been some alien world that's examining us so it would have to be something that would be able to recognize our signal and visit us but don't lie look at observable planets in systems and discover Goldilocks planets weekend we examine those planets from vast distances away and wouldn't you assume that a life-form that is perhaps thousands of years more advanced than us with the exponential increase and get knowledge even if they ever got to the point where we are that they would CDs Goldilocks planets as well and recognized that Earth is one of them yes however if they are so far away there going to be examining Earth as it was hundreds of thousands or millions or billions of years ago if you truly want them to be examining Austin to sense of human presence on planet Earth then it's a much more difficult proposition to imagine that they back to be doing is it possible there's another way to examine things we are not hampered by the speed of life not not not home that I know of I mean any signal in the world that we're aware of is restricted by special ed by by the speed of travel which is angerment which is a strange property of the quantum World in which distant objects can behave as if they are one and then sometimes respond instantaneously to an influence in one location at a distant location no matter how far apart they are but that isn't really observing that more that's more realizing correlations between physical properties at widely separated locations but I'm not aware of a means of leveraging that to actually observe what's happening in some distant location even if you do have but that isn't really observing that more that's more realizing correlations between physical properties at widely separated locations but I'm not aware of a means of leveraging that to actually observe what's happening in some distant location even if you do have Quantum entangled particles</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I went to a wolf sanctuary this past weekend talk to me what was depressing was first of all they neuter them when they get in there they kind of have to because I don't want to breed cuz they didn't the create more of the same situation but then the other thing is that they're in this pain and then they don't get to be free play wolves want to run and Hunt that's what they want to do they want to hunt that he never even released them into the wild or anyting listen to this these animals alive and they're feeding them and they do love them and they go in there and take care of him and pet him but to me it's like that's a f****** wolf that we'll should be on a mountain somewhere it shouldn't be living like that they're beautiful biologist has been on the podcast for I'm getting kiss right there by a wolf they're very sweet like you can you can some of them you can Pat and hug them and hang on to them and they like you but you're like people but they're f****** wolves like you eat your you're not telling them s*** like there's no sit lie down f*** you like there wolves and that they have somewhere and that is a lot of what they did they did keep a lot of them from being put down but but I left there feeling really depressed I just like all the big cats called cats it's always like someone who had a pet tiger who would like this would be cool and it wasn't in captivity in Texas in people's backyards in the water and all the wild of the world today staying in like a slow debate yet it doesn't have a bit about them like they're the only animals that don't feel bad for the zoo because they're walking around the zoo like another day with no lions lions Majestic I'm not sure where it is but yeah sure was a tiger sanctuary in Thailand it was so depressing cuz they were all drugged cuz you take a picture with a tiger two in a room in a room there's a pain and is a little cup that I need a couple of weeks old for 5 weeks old around people 6 weeks old and you can play with them but they're super energetic to jumping on you in a SWOT and things are playing with each other and rolls around and then as they get older it gets to a year to and then they stop the stop being natural than the older all drugged so you could be around a little or tigers and there's a bunch of handlers around everybody's real nervous they keep the the Tigers away from you and the tigers are they looking at you but they're there their they're kind of a year old then you get to the tiger Zinda just f***** up there all drugged they're all drugged that's crazy and I guess that's like that's like my brain never thought of like all yeah they must be drugged in order to be sitting in a room with strangers and not freaking out like I never Jaguar tiger guy like you always seeing the tiger that I'm playing around like they actually like the guy I'm not getting another one but he's got a tiger Rehabilitation place it's the same kind of deal like wrestles with these tigers and trees with a machete put things the wolf thing was a real bummer I didn't think I was going to buy me out as much but it don't me out I mean I'm happy to those people are doing it and then I think what they're doing amazing don't get me wrong but for me I just a feeling of like being around that thing I got a thing wants to run</div>

The girls do I get to fight the popular girls because like they knew only until I tried on the guys in the gym lift the shade up anybody ever done that on purpose in a fight with was I don't remember who she was fighting but Leslie Smith boob popped out once getting struck the photos like this girls gangster season saying I love her I love her she's K and she's so late nice I like such a hippie you know outside of that sounds like a really funny MMA Union I think she's still fighting for the UFC fighters even though she's not in the UFC I haven't looked into that like I haven't looked at like what do they what do they want what are they trying to accomplish what's not correct that they want to fix Healthcare not good enough yet or you'll see I think those are the things that they're working towards how does Healthcare where are you guys covered in training or you only covered for fights as far as I know if you booked a fight and get injured I think they cover it but I think it's also a great area where like they could not cover it and they're not legally obligated to fix you but I think in the past they have I'm not sure I can't think of any any examples where they haven't liked you know taking care of the medical expenses of someone who got hurt but I know like a lot of times Fighters don't claim it in time like after fights or it's like a little nagging injury that becomes a big deal further down the line I can't go in for like a loose tooth or like or like of a shoulder that I tore and practice if I wasn't getting ready for a fight and if you haven't really made a name for yourself yet sometimes you know even if you just don't ask like you don't get taken care of it's not like is not in your contract once you sign like oh I'm going to fight this many fights but there's nothing in there that says if I get injured after signing this contract I'm covered medically so so yeah I think that was that was the main reason I was like all this is a good idea just because like I know so many fighters who booked fights Justice danger is taking care of you know or they will fight injured and claim an old injury and like and that's their way of fixing whatever they broke during training so it's horrible I hope you don't get hurt in practice to the point where you can actually just go do it inside the Octagon outside of Camp because I'm stupid or or I'm just like f****** around like when I'm fighting someone who's my hand punching them break my break my leg break my toe like kicking them you know and it's even more difficult right because of the lack of people that are your size to train within your also train a lot with men and it's crazy because at a professional level like you're right there you know you just beat the s*** out of Hannah cifers it was a crazy fight my gear your in the heat right now yeah right there for you you're your you know you're at the top of the Heap in this Championship realm right and to train with people have bigger than you or to take chances like that like that there's no other sport that would have that dangerous is training with like some of the bigger guys like the like guys and girls are kind of like different sizes like if I'm if I'm training with a guy who fights at 1:15 he's going to be like for foot tall you know it's like the weight distribution is different but it's like the weight District distribution is different but like I don't know something about I guess training with women like the strands the 4th that's coming at you versus the forces given to them there's a ride I just feel like it's a lot safer to train with lemon for sure</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> obviously gone through some improvements and some change look what's changed with you over the last like four or five fights because you keep getting steadily better but protecting the last two I think you should be on a four-fight win streak because there was Alan down in yin and she's on this card to get mad at me like spiders or other people but that was one where fans of her got mad at me because you guys were right in front and you had her triangle and I was yelling pulled ahead I was gallon polar head pull her head ahead pulled ahead and people like you f****** dick telling her to pull the hair 4 fight win streak she's like a strong girl looks like something's going on like you're on another level do you feel it like one love someone lost and I think after the Randa fight a fart Randa Markos about this time last year and and I was just so pissed at the way that went down because I was like super nervous going into it I felt like this was that was going to be a fight that kind of set me above the heat because Randall so tough and she kind of has that same like Uptown that I do so I'm like okay this is going to set me apart when I get a streak going this is going to the fight that puts me in a rankings and I and I put a lot of weight on it and it and I had like ESPN follow me that week too so I was just super nervous and like the entire time during the fight like I wasn't in the fight like I was overthinking every position like there was a point where I had ran up against again the fight seems like it was 30 minutes long even though it was like 2 minutes you know but like the moment that I had her up against the cage I remember like this thing if I hold her hair she can't do anything to me and that's like the exact opposite of what you should be thinking in a fight you should be thinking I need to hurt her you know like I need to her. I need to do whatever whatever it takes to look like I'm trying to finish the fight so I hesitated my corner was yelling elbow I didn't throw the elbow ran it through the elbow and then from there I was just like a like two steps behind I felt like and so that fog was a really weird thing for me because I never really thought about the mental side of fighting like I thought I was doing everything right like I would visualize and you know I tell myself all positive things and you know do do everything that you you think you have to do before a fight but that just kind of showed me like I'm not doing enough because I knew I had the skills to beat her butt or at least the skills to make it look more competitive but I didn't show it like it like the pressure was already there and then I found out about the ESPN thing and I feel like it was just me over because I've always had this I guess this fear of losing too much you know and it started when I got into the UFC I had like my tough I didn't go well but I was one fight you know in my MMA career and I was in the UFC already so I went on to win but then I lost two in a row and got cut and from that moment on a Mike's like people are just going to think of me of this person who loses all the time and then I went on a four-fight went streaking Invicta but then when I came back to the UFC I lost it dry and even though it was like probably the fight that people still talk about to this day even though great Cloud looming over like my confidence because of my record has helped she went on to to do such great things when it came to fighting someone like a similar story where she is talented but she's fought a lot of tough people and lost them or gotten like we're decisions against people I don't know I just felt like this was my chance to is that I'm not that like I'm a better fighter than my record shows until then when the ESP the anything was throwing on and I just like it was just me baking up a situation that wasn't that big you know like it was no different from you know my fight with Ashley Yoder I felt more present in my drive by it like it was no bigger than those fights but I just big tit up in my head and I felt like it was a result of me just pushing down all this anxiety that I have what time I fight not really addressing it I just started reading like those we me and my husband but he read them and then he's tired of doing like the mental coach thing for me but everyone everything every resource that I looked at says pretty much the same thing is that you have to focus on being present and being present each day and not like dwelling on the past bringing the pain into that present moment just trusting in your reactions and trusting in your preparation and so that's what I've been doing is like I have been doing like more like actual visualization exercises and just everytime I'm in the gym I just focus on being there at the gym I'm not thinking about like what's going to happen if this happens what's going to happen if that happens I just I focused on the jewelry non-exercise we're doing I go as hard as possible and I think just having that fight and having a goal so badly force me to go into the gym and just say f*** it you know and it is literally just like that f*** it mentality what's going to happen if I lose like I'm thinking that in the fight like it when I went to the gym the next it like blue like the next Monday I went to jail in like f*** it you know and I just went hard and like the next recession I said f*** it and I went hard and like those are like the best sparring sessions I had up to that date like people are guys guys who like you usually wouldn't really say much after your aunt something today like you dislike combinations and your volume and this and that like yeah you you're really getting after it like okay okay I think of like going to unlock something about what went wrong that's huge cuz they come up with some you know something that went that didn't go their way that should have gone their way and they don't address the real issue you're you're addressing the actual issues going on in your brain and you know that that's what it was I think yeah but is like something I kind of had to learn from the get-go you know we're going to a Go-Go Sport psychologist in the past and I really just feel like everyone kind of says the same thing so I feel like if you're getting it from any resource that's good like I started using that mindfulness app forget what it's called I had faith that really helped us just like can I calm my nerves and keep the anxiety from from being crippling sometimes what happens when you go to a coach is the fact that you physically go to someone and you sit down with us it's like a different level of commitment sit down with this person this person formulate a strategy for how you address some of the issues that are going on your mind and then sometimes you can hypnotist like Vinny shoreman you know Vinny it's like you're in a room next I'm going to do I'm like I want to know what that is you know and he is really good at working with Fighters at addressing each other a lot of stuff to like FaceTime and s*** to like it wasn't he lives in England but he's working with Joe Schilling he's worked with a lot of different Fighters but he basically tries to get you to understand personal you already on a really good path did you understand what you did wrong right and then you understand to be more present those two things are critical that's everything went wrong so you already doing that and then concentrating what you're really good at and just saying f*** it and letting it go expressing yourself being being with you that you know that you could be when you're on it's like how to capture that and hold that thought and then bring it inside the octagon and be able to recreate those feelings when you're actually under pressure of competition as you lay back and he just sort talks you through it it's very weird therapy and you definitely feel like a changing your brain weird stuff that people do in these comedy hypnotism shows where I was like I don't think they could do that to me cuz I'm not going to believe that I'm really on a cruise ship right now and Pirates are coming or whatever but it is like you're listening to his voice but you're in a different state of consciousness but you're able to put away the outside world for a brief amount of time and he concentrates on Flo the getting you to a state of flow that flow State when everything's going great know that feeling when you see things in your you're hitting someone with someone with something before you even know that there's an opening there hello the getting you to a state of flow that flow State when everything's going great know that feeling when you see things in your you're hitting someone with someone with something before you even know that there's an opening there</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> it's a great time in the sport that was so much exciting so many exciting possible matchups are you what do you pump for like when you look at the the lake to the UFC and it wasn't until the third round that I decided to use elbows and I'm pretty sure I dropped there in the third round and she popped right back up but like ever since then I noticed that like she would get hit like she would get hit rock like in the in the Taurus fight like teaching isn't known for having like knockout power crazy hands but she dropped her like a good like two or three times in the in the Taurus fight so I can see that that 10 was getting will you member the you want E&amp;J check fight she just she ate off fuckload of shots Rose by she's getting picked apart the entire time sacrificing her head to get in and get the throw or whatever and then finally like you know gave out on her in the Willie fight so I wasn't like super surprise out I was I mean everyone was surprised so I won't say that but I did see that coming eventually like I'm like eventually someone's going to put her out just because it's not just a person's power that she's fighting but it's her pressures aggressive is he's coming in so hard so it's like her Force versus the other person's punch when they can act like she's not going herself out essentially like I wasn't super surprised and that was what my what I thought would happen when I fought her like I didn't go into that fight thinking man is going to suck you know I was like dude I can catch her like she drops her hands when she comes forward like my I can strike going it's like I know I'm going to catch her in like I can put her out because of the way she strikes so I've always seen that her hands were a bit sloppy even though she's super aggressive and the fact that she's so aggressive gives her that much success like you you can't ignore the fact that she's punching it as much as she is but it's still like very offencive and like with 0 defense in mind so surprised but you know I hadn't really seen that much of a Willy's angso so I was surprised that she was able to get the title of that that fast because she has a lot of output I think she isn't afraid to go to the ground I saw that and when she fought Tisha they had like a lot of crazy scramble she had good reverses for like teaches takedown attempts and stuff and and yeah just think it's going to be like she's going to force ioana to move into react more than most people I think like as long as she's like I haven't really seen haven't really can you tell like I'm a head movement she has but I do know that she just throws a lot of volume and wherever the fight goes she seems comfortable so I've never seen her in a spot where she looks like what do I do here you know like to see people freaking out against the cage or freaking out when they get taken down and she seems to flow that she has that athletic flow through everything so that's the one thing I think she has going for her but I do think you're on his reach is what made her so dominant she's little girl like watching her fight and draw there was a moment where like she's pushing and dried up against the cage and she looks like a bagel like praying mantis like she's a big girl with really long legs and everything love you yeah buddy like kind of up to my like I don't know like props or whatever when she was about to fight Michelle there are rumors that she was going to make late and so people are scrambling and then my manager my manager was like well I bet and it would take it if you guys wanted a fight and he is like seriously and he's like yeah she's crazy and I was there corner and my my teammate Lauren Mueller at the time so I was there chilling where every Atlanta I think maybe I forget where was it might have been Atlanta corner of my friend and time of the night that you know it's a fight offer so he was like hey yeah yeah it was like then he was like well what about Michelle at 1:15 he just wanted to know just so we can relay the message I was like yeah. Just let me know so I can like cut weight or not cut weight you know so I was sitting waiting for waiting for the call and then the rumors got like blasted and then people knew my name was in it for some reason I was just like who is talking yeah everyone was talking about it and then somehow somebody knew that my name was in the mix like Angela hell might fill in for Michelle and instead of filling for Ian I like it because she was like the name that was that they were promoting for the fight so so they wanted the former chance to get her fight so they're like all right if it comes down to it and he'll fighter at 1:25 that was pretty spelled I mean I feel like you wanna does a lot of things and it's similar with my matchup that I have now only she's a lot bigger you wanted does a lot of things that I've seen a lot of you know and training just like in my in my first years of Muay Thai like she has a very conventional style when it comes to moytie she's very good at it so a fight with Yoanna is always something that I've wanted to have just because of it would be something that I've seen before be like I'm not going to be you know I'm not going to be afraid of the Clint you know which and she's really good at not going to be afraid of the clients I'm not going to be afraid of when elbows going to come because of elbow sparked like my entire fight career so it's like it's like things that I see with her or less scary than a fight with someone that she's beat before like and ride or or a good Deli or someone like that so a lot coming this coming fight like what she's got left because that the transition 25 didn't really work out like shevchenko was just a little too much for should take it already beat her outside the UFC and then beat her again and then each just didn't look like she had the Firepower to keep her offer at 1:25 and then so she goes down to 15 to GHIN but we know how hard it was for her to make 15 and that's one of things that they had said or Tampa said about her chin when was pot roast like she's just couldn't because she was so depleted and we'll find out this way Lee hits f****** hard so determined like I feel like she was in a real bad relationship and was a contributing factor to a lot of losses so we're going to find out because you know when you go back to look like when she fought Jessica penne she was asked Aries woman alive like she was f****** ferocious when she was and she was lighting everybody on fire she was terrifying I'm so aggressive fight someone who was good who get who is actually a better Striker then her and Rose like the fact that just the fact that roasted move laterally you know like Jana was always like a back-and-forth fighter because that's like her style is very moytie and Rose just moving to the side every now and then are having head movement I think that really sucked her up and like it's hard when you when you fight someone like that for the first time or even Spar someone like that for the first time you can't find them you know all your punches message all right when you when you fight someone like that for the first time where you inspire someone like that for the first time you can't find them you know all your punches miss you gas out you freaking out because you're missing your punches thing you're getting countered and it's like a lot to deal with for straightforward more mytifi tirsa</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> at the top of the Heap in this Championship realm right and to train with people with bigger than you or to take chances like that there's no other sport that would have that women as well because even if some of the bigger guys like the just like if I'm if I'm training with a guy who fights at 1:15 he's going to be like for foot tall you know it's like the weight distribution is different but like I don't know something about women like the strands the 4th that's coming at you versus the forces are given to them there's a ride I just feel like it's a lot safer the train with lemon for sure for sure yeah they would be bigger than you gotta be strong you but you get used to that then you'd be used to men and then when you fight with women they would seem smaller and weaker so when I was at like my little gym in New York I was only trying with guys like the girls I would come in and they weren't at my level and that's the same story that most girls into UFC have you know they were the top of their he there like the baddest girl in the gym what are the girls and hang with the guys and I was me so it wasn't until I got on tough that I realize like everyone has the same exact background so everyone's tough because they were training with guys and you start to underestimate like how tough girls going to be in there like when you're fighting like tooth and nail like you noted as basically like until when you're ready to give in like a hundred percent in the cage it feels like just as strong as a guy you know it's so it's good to like still have those checks and balances like okay like yeah maybe she's not as strong as the guys I train with but she is going as hard as she can or she's defending it as hard as you can or you know she's taking my punches that I thought like I do if I drop this guy with this punched and this girl's going to get dropped to and it's not the case like she's just as tough a tougher so it's it's like a weird thing where like you have like I don't know you have different stats like stacked in some areas that guys don't and then they have stat stacked in the areas that women don't so it's like it's like if I was is like if I was like a a bantamweight guy who only trained with like light heavyweights you know like you're going to be faster you're going to have like you're probably going to be more technical just because you have kind of people that big so if you f****** a technique is not going to work but those guys are still going to be bigger and stronger and be able to like muscle you hold you down that kind of thing so I feel like that's like a similar difference better be nice he does same to you he's going to put you out and I was like shitt I never thought about that cuz I just assumed like I just assumed that like me Landing A Hard Punch on a heavyweight isn't going to hurt as much as me Landon A Hard Punch on someone closer to my size that make sense don't like their neck is bigger get it right then that's the only take so much so it's like that is a lot less than like if I was throwing a body shot you know like that's it's a little easier to be mean right there</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> this one lady who got arrested and she's got arrested for serving or selling all these different animals she was selling Eagles this is probably more likely to be like Cynthia's or whatever even though I got a ride. trunks around each other and it's crazy like they're not it that is not like a deer deer don't even know what the f*** is going on they make a truck that make the body that make the tea retrain an elephant to paint himself as it's so weird to watch or is it just incredible memories a bunch of things on a screen and chips can point out exactly what they saw if they get a reward like a big candy give them candy if they can lay out like some numbers and some things like in the in the correct order where you are at work what the f*** did I see it I remember we're burdened by too much information and data and also it's a different Champs can just do it watch I mean apparently this is like they train this elephant specifically to learn how to do this but it's still crazy impressive cuz he doesn't really good job but better than like a four-year-old would like a four-year-old person or do you know one of my kids and therefore they wouldn't do is go to job making a f****** elephant what thing is controversial because they taught the elephant had to paint himself but it still has like a elephant ride and I do feel guilty about it other than but they probably gave him some treat ya no I mean they're all drawn themselves as more than one duck what they are what an elephant looks like what is a says the truth about elephant paintings what is the truth they had not tracing that but like they must have trained them to make a certain shape so I doubt that the elephant knows that that's him you know but who knows PetSmart yeah but they only live for like a couple weeks does that work run around with them and then feed them sugarcane and then you ride them and I was the riding part I was like I don't want to do that I felt that big Hook when they so when we went to the one that we went to they have this like big pole with a little hook on it and it never like hit some or anything but it's just resting on like their shoulder I figured I'd like that was what they used to like get him to behave so it's like it's like someone sitting next to you before like a whip you know like you know what it could do it didn't do anything but you just know it's there no dude this place one through and I will definitely say is that they treated those elephants like pets through them really well and you can tell their relationship with their trunk around the people in the people would rub their head and they wanted to be around those people and then they would feed him a lot of sugar cane like we had big stocks a sugarcane in they would make you full to the Hardy was a real pillow Rehabilitation thing for elephants and a lot of the elephants have been in circuses and things like that and then they actually it reintroduced a lot of them to the Wild and when we were there these elephants are not in cages they were free roaming they just like they fill your hand and then they grab the tree around it and then back to a place where they can exist in the wild cuz they basically everything that's in the jungle just grab it need it I know what to do so while we're hanging out with them but they're there their disposition big and gentle gentle I mean so f****** big and they help you get up on them they lift their leg up and you stand on their leg and then you pull yourself up onto their back and then hang on to this rope that's around the vision seem to mind that you were on their back but still it felt like I'd rather just feed him and pet him yeah, it was really cool I wanted to go up to chiangmai but we were we're at this place called a I love the bathroom but that water is filled with s*** in the water while you're out there</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> so when I when I was in my career and just kind of getting you know kind of trying to figure out like what was an extra make you know it was hard you know it was just a hard place because yeah I really have anybody to talk to you I don't really know what I was going to do next in my life you know and then when I started fighting again I still was in that place where I just wasn't you know totally back to fighting my mentality because fighting is is something mentally that it it takes a certain mentality for you know in infamy fighting with something that I did to exercise some demons a bit you know but but having some time away from the sport it allow me to figure out other ways to exercise soejima demons in you know figure out some things around if you know the things that made me mad at things that were my fuel before I kind of made peace with them and it making peace with a lot of things that I was using for my fuel it just change play I fought in the way I seen fighting so coming back to fight I just wasn't that same fighter anymore and then when I got to the point where I was like man I can't keep myself like I was like man I'm not fighting the way I want to fight and you know there's I mean what's the point if I can't go and compete where I want to I'm only towards myself so then I decided to retire but then when I retired I was still wasn't up space were all that man is still something missing so then when I did 5 Meo DMT that kind of put things in perspective in a whole different way you know and it and it just it it change me it changed me a lot to change the way that you like I said the way I think the way I eat everything everything about it you know so it was it was so cathartic until medicine is so many sense of the word you know you think that something like that would be really beneficial for Fighters that are in the Twilight of their career I think I think it could be every fighter gets to a point where you fight enough then fighting it kind of a kind of you kind of getting a weird space about and you know I seen Fighters go through that. Where they just kind of like figure out that why am I still doing this you know they've had Great Moments Inside the Cage but then they have those down moments and those down moments are the moments where it's harder to come back from and I think those are the times where you you know a psychedelic or something like that could put things in perspective and in a lot of fire to see the why behind the reason they're doing it and maybe create a new why it's you know like what happens to them if the f****** coronavirus hits and I get lye doors for 6 months and just become a agoraphobic and is your s*** well we were talking about this the other day that most of what this is all happened from the Reagan Administration during the Reagan Administration they change the standards of what it means to be mentally ill and they just released people from Asylum didn't want to pay for it all and you don't look if La is Elias city of 20 + million people which is as many people in La as I think is in all of Australia so think about that think about the amount of money and that they can't make a silence here thinking about how I abandoned buildings there are through how much money how much money would it cost if there's currently someone the neighborhood have thousand homeless people yeah they said there was some statistic that said there's more empty apartments in this town then homeless people the thing is though those folks don't just need a place cuz they'll f*** that play at a rehabilitation and they need medication and they need counseling and they need me and some people I don't I mean I'm not a mental health expert some of them you might not be able to do anything to and also they get so filled with despair I knew a bunch of guys that were homeless back from my pool hall days was a bunch of guys that would hang around the pool hall they would even sleep on the floor and you know I knew guys who try to sleep in people's couches asleep at the bus stops and then they've come to the pool and try to hustle up enough money to get some drugs and out it was they were stuck in this place where they could never get past where they were they were just in a rut and they can never get out of it and it was it's heartbreaking despair despair cuz you're just like what happened since the other day I'm walking down Santa Monica Boulevard over by Barney's Beanery and the I just hear up and I had to be 22 23 years old and I was like what happened where are your parents what time do that you meet in this town will you meet him early in their journey and they still have hope like it's not worked out yet but it's going to I'm going to make it and then you run into in comics you're so I mean that's the thing I think I've is so relatable and field as well cuz you your people have been fighting for 400 years okay first of all I'm in the midst of my question in the ears that your people that part of the question became incredibly important and Ruby were very sensitive about that because you said you said of our people golden medaille I'm not speaking for him I'm just doing what you said he said my people have been fighting for his so if he had said our people I would have said our people but I can't take possession of your quote it's not me saying it ramp up at this time and he starts shouting my face like your people too so you know what I'm talking about he said don't try to bait you know what I'm talking about when I say these things around like can you tell them what you talkin about what he said to me on numerous occasions and different interviews and off-camera I know exactly what he's talking about and I know that this moments that you finally get to talk about it right the people who have never been listening to him before but it took me him he couldn't he needed to keep saying it I don't know why you were saying you're my people to my people to so what I wanted when I wanted what I thought was happening was that okay this moment now has become about him like attacking me because he thinks I'm attacking him he thinks because I do know he's talked about he knows we've spoken about it numerous times not said no like some Uncle Tom the internet as though I'm trying to return like a long-drawn game to you know Institute Market reforms Usher in the richest for the for the middle class a lot of people out of poverty but in a very controlled way in in a way that's like she doesn't think about Asian culture if you understand it's that the there's a fundamental difference between the China dream and the American dream right at incision pain is outlined what he thinks is this kind of dream it's it's it's basically a top-down way to to the golden National goal and and basically what they're trying to say is that what we're going to get Lyft poverty but you have to meet your generation has to make sacrifices it's not about the individual it's about building a strong China and implicitly also about ensuring that the CCP station called Chinese Communist Party Station power but it's it's that you might have to give up you know personal sacrifices for the sake of China versus the American dream is is it's about your right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that's it and if you do that that's the Americans if you achieve a certain level happen. You know it's all like if bottom-up it's not it's not centralize and it's not something that the Chinese government is trying to stuff down your throat and China's willing to play the long game so it is still a leninist Marxist government still believes in all of that that's why it's also to tell Terry but it's you know they know that like the way to get gain power in the world is to get rich they did it on the backs of trade with other countries to very unfair practices actually been kisses so if you think about like housing I think they're there a lot of estimates of how much they've actually stolen from the United States corporate corporate Espionage now even like they didn't listen to that guy was in connection with some weaponized program offering a lot of money expose on this offer money to like academic cuz you know it's going to be one here and send self like not paid that well but China's dangling like a lot more money it's okay if you do research here in China there's going to be like less bureaucracy so that's their way to lyrics people in he's getting income for me I was he hiding it didn't report it and</div>

Bubbles it's what it is like people love when you are between two people love when you're predictable right that's one of the reasons why people love when people dress up in suits you dress like a suit in a suit in you act like a business person you used to say words that are you know you speak in a very very similar way the other people that you work with and it makes it easy to map out what you're probably going to do and how you going to react is a very narrow band that you're operating in when you wearing a suit in the tie invented office there's a narrow band you can be the a****** Suit &amp; Tie guy or you can be the standard you know it work language human being a gentleman you know that that kind of stuff is that's people like that because they know that they can kind of predict you they know what they know where you going from the when you're eccentric and when you're outside the box you're unpredictable and eclectic taste if they don't like it you have the interesting ideas that are that are completely irreverent and don't fit into these pattern like what is what is she up to what the f*** is going on her head. They're watching wrestling pro wrestling play religious if if they if you're deeply religious and they're deeply religious they know that they can talk to you in a certain way without the Lord has a way of making things work out yes it does Compu has a dust and they know that you're going to think in this narrow bandwidth you're not going to get outside that box your your good Christian why I know Mike &amp; Mike's a good Christian you know and all that stuff I hear about him just doesn't make any sense famous narrowband will that's why politicians almost always adopt some form of religious ideology even Trump trump was basically never religious is entire life never and now he's got a religious that lady who has is basic like a wacky manager she's like a wacky manager in the WWE that talks to God and helps Trump out that's how I look at it I'm like this is his wacky manager he's got a character now it doesn't go all the way to the outside edges but I wouldn't be shocked I I don't see religious lady really pretty isn't she all the threads of my life it's just that I I definitely opposed the one I'm going to win again I'll have to do is listen this crazy lady talk to me about Jesus if people going to buy into it it's a great move you know I mean he didn't go secular at all right but if you look at his past and its history like he's not a really just got and all sudden he is and nobody even questions it I think is performative church-going I don't think he's going to do adderall together to listen to ACDC at f*** like rabbits church-going I don't think he yeah okay you can go back to do adderall together to listen to ACDC a f*** like rabbits</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> there was an article today where they've confirmed that Huawei has some sort of third-party back door with a lot of their Electronics a lot of speculation to why the United States was Banning Huawei from the major providers from very close to releasing some they have some amazing phones and they were really close to my Facebook could ever be you know in your phone tell me why what is what are your thoughts on it and Huawei it with respect to the next year of the digital world is the next Sputnik like it is the Sputnik issue we should be doing everything we can to 22 not out how far are we to you have this big market share and the person who started it wasn't somebody that had a lot of party connections to to the general or something and it's really late really offering away that's very opaque and we'll have to have connections to the government's especially when you're that big and because you can expect that that whatever information that they would have to answer to the government whatever the government wants if you're willing to put your privacy in the hands of an entity like that you know go ahead but know also that all these Mass surveillance policies its I just wouldn't trust them Chinese manufacturers of cell phones and the government connection and also let you know just it's also heavily subsidized by the government has been competing kind of unfairly you can drive out innovation in the United States by by making sure that your local version is so competitive from prices that they can't match you so in a way it's like a form of economic Warfare which is one of the issues that Trump has really pushed back on its the China trade issue it's interesting because I think the Democrats were a lot more you know protection is when it came to trade right there were the Republicans and Libertarians always like free trade free Trail everything like we don't let's globalize the world Thomas Friedman position when he wrote about it in Lexus and the Olive Tree that if we globalize the world that I cannot that you're at you you look a lot of people are poverty or economic pie gross but your politics drink that was the idea right no two countries that have or something like that. Was a theory and in the case of china obviously that didn't happen right like the part about the politics changing relating to China I was you know I was a little stunned it was so open and can you explain what happened going to they're supposedly autonomous region China promised them that they would be two systems one country two systems after the Handover in 1997 from the British 222 China slowly kind of eroded that in many ways and their freedoms have been kind of diminishing basically was after a case that happened the criminal case and the Hong Kong people knew that this law if it goes into effect basically gives the Chinese government legal right to disappear kidnap anyone and bring them for trial and some sort of kangaroo or show trial in in in China and booksellers it's always huge the politburo huge and so there was a Bookseller call Causeway books when they were publishing all these like accounts from within the and the owner of that. basically we just have allowed China to do that legally this time so the Hong Kong used for us in arms that you know that they were tired of all there were two ways that their way of life has changed since the British handed it over and all kind of pine for the good old times and they were under a colonial English how big do but China Market is for the NBA right like that all these players have contracts with them inspect the Houston Rockets hit a lot of contracts with the Chinese cctv4 broadcast they also had like merchandising opportunities sneakers that were made it there and that caused the huge huge outcry in China they were just like us I'm sorry for hurting the feelings of the Chinese people and then like all the other NBA players actually came out and and you know kind of took the side of the Chinese government like alway who are we to do you know when they're so strong on wrong on other forms of activism Charlotte North Carolina the bathroom with the biggest oppressor</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I've heard intelligent people make this conversation about other intelligent people that disagree with them like Ben Shapiro that like Ben Shapiro should be deplatformed because Ben Shapiro is indoctrinating people towards right-wing ideology by having the sailing points and articulate sentences and these these rancid he goes on he speaks very fast to get a great grasp of the English language is very compelling and the ideas doctor dating young people will know he's speaking with passion I don't agree with him on a lot of things but I certainly agree with his right and he's like when he's he would never go to a gay person's wedding he wouldn't have he wouldn't even go to the celebrate after party of a gay wedding and I'm like what this is all for religious reasons like that ridiculous I will you care my my perspective is what do you care if his prospective is he couldn't support that because of religious reasons so then we go deep in the hole with why how deep do you go with Jesus came back from the dead like he doesn't he's Jewish it's a different perspective by do you think you know that do you really think that God thinks that homosexuality is some sort of a carnal sin in in in in in terrible if so God made why do they make homosexuals please explain that what what kind of a weirdo is God that he gives people this urge to be gay but then he tells them fight that urge and then he makes his comparison to that's like murder sometimes you want to murder people make okay that's different people all day everyday I know a lot of dudes all the time it's such a crazy thing to their system and for you to believe in God but have a problem with that to me ridiculous so now we're banking on these really ancient words that were written by people with no grasp of Sines no understanding of biology no understanding of the culture of the world don't understand these people and taking into perspective that you know you're literally dealing with under what percentage of the population is gay the goal should be a cohesive Society where people are comfortable being around each other with all their differences whatever it doesn't matter the individual should matter and the way we interact with each other that should matter by these things that were written down thousands of years ago before people had any of these understandings of all the sudden chances of humanity and all the differences of people haven't and now the biological understands why they have these differences what you're dealing with ignorance you're you're applying these ancient ignorant rules to a modern world will we have a vastly expanded understanding of human beings f*** off you have parents were super Christian like I understand it was going to hell it was because of this belief that she's going to end up burning in Hell Tour coming from a place of Love GS and it's based on Bronze Age ideology but but you know I don't think that that either with or a daughter that she loves her and he talks about that it's all the sudden you see stammer in and it gets weird cuz he knows it's nonsense. he's a decent person he's a nice person he's very friendly he's funny I enjoy his company a lot I like Ben Shapiro I really do I think he's a brilliant guy I mean the gay things the biggest one cuz me that's the dumbest one like it might it always comes back to why do you care that's all it is to me like why do you care I don't care why do you care if someone's gay like if it if it doesn't affect you how can it affect you are you do you have your fingers and everybody's business likes crazy doesn't make any sense to me that argument against gay marriage like what why does it affect 12 the sanctity of marriage remember man that is so dumb to a f****** drive-thru and get it and get married at a drive-thru movie theater I mean that's really what it's like when you get married anywhere so ridiculous</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> your Instagram is hilarious by the way but also very funny nonprofit organization yeah we thought you'd be spent like what a trillion dollars on the Warren Tara and what was the results right like Wheatley marched in and feel like they were going to bring freedom and democracy to people but if there were no cultural institutions to kind of nuts people to understand why they should value freedom and democracy is it really a surprise that it failed to take Route there so that's what we basically organization you know we basically take acquire the rights to books that are not available their translate them into Arabic for free and then we just like loaded up on the library site anyone can basically access that download it so like if you look it up would you even understand what the word verbally means so how did you get involved in this and it's it's so issue with that look for me I I just felt like throwing up I was not I was kind of like you know what my issue is that like there was no freedom of thought freedom of speech in Singapore at the government is trying to control everything I can think is part of the human Spirit you know that if you say you can't have something we'll just the ground if you if you try to ban it so it's the whole Spirit of a punk rock of like a feudal system and that's just lies and almost you know everything the heart where she see that with our books right Temple you know a lot of books are actually like transmitted on these telegram groups in Arabic so the Gap that we're trying to plug right now it's that the books are not available in that language this is crazy statistic more books are translated between English and Spanish in one year than English and Arabic in a thousand years and you know you're at your average person living in Syrian refugee camp isn't going to learn that quickly they are 10% living Arrow say Saudi Arabia and like 10 out of every ten times one time there's no answer because the page doesn't exist or you know it just the word feminism doesn't exist in Arabic so you can look it up while secularism it's kind of its how do you expect people to kind of break out of there or their indoctrination I just want to live in a world where being ignorant is choice for everyone has a choice for us like you're like just like basically you spend your nights watching The Bachelor or let you know whatever it is it's like does I'm calling you out and you know you know you watch that s*** bro parts of the world when the problems of getting them to shift their perception of the world is that they're not exposed all the great works but not exposed to the debate in the Quran is actually read but they really mean just this one thing and you know just the sort of like eight habits of a free mind are not really cultivated and also when you were taught when growing out not to question things and in part I understand because I think when you grow up in a household with like you know tiger parents there's this sense of like you don't question my authority if you kind of grow up in that environment you're going to internalize all those things and that's why it kind of you know follows you overtime so when you were in school you're taught no questions really interesting for you to go from this one fairly restrictive environment to a fairly open environment and did that shift that happened in you and being exposed all these different I did that spark this desire to help other people so to expand their their their ideas and what they're supposed to I want a Sunday school too I was like I was that kid was just like you no excuse me but why why did the dinosaurs what why is in the Bible that the dinosaurs and and and human beings walked you know basically like days apart when like we know from science that it was millions of yours and fossils and of course of course play listen must be the God was testing people and this is why sacrum in the Middle East asking a question could be deaf right if you if you even remotely like it's inside Arabia festae remotely reveal that you might be having a theistic thought that stuff was like we're talkin about different scales and degrees with censorship and consequences for that and I think when I met my co-founder Faisal you know I was like okay I guess I have I had issues and countering violent extremism US Army some things okay you know that this is where I'll cat is this was telling my friend here it has been like radicalized and kind of you on a Hit List you know because he was not sympathetic to their cause and so I ended up on the deathless his brother killed just horrible story sequence of saying what you think there is like at least in my case was just like a maybe I might go to jail in Singapore with an environment must be like because we're so accustomed to this idea of freedom of speech and yes it's so ingrained you rebels are appreciated Maverick sing I think you know as long as America still can celebrate Mavericks and Tall celebrate them where we're going to be right of human behavior when you see any for me dictatorship propaganda or control by the stator by industry that stuff that you see in other countries is human beings in 2020 I mean we would like to think that our Constitution Bill of Rights and all of our ideals and what this country was founded on is going to keep it from deteriorating like that and most likely it will but the reality is those people in Iraq or human beings in 2020 and they are living in a completely different way than we're living right now at the same time now at the same on the same timeline as things did not go well there and they're stuck in this horrible situation where they are controlled by these religious Fanatics and they are stuck and there's not a lot that they can do other than Escape</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> one of the culture shock things for me when I first moved to America it was that you know I think a lot of American kids were told like participation trophy culture a lot of them were told that they were the best David telling their friends on practicing going on American Idol didn't nobody tell them that grow like you should just be singing the shower nobody told them attempting to eat bull testicles and it's now a show on the Food Network right now those people are delusional the mentally ill they have like legitimate mental health issues and then they go on saying and they sound terrible and no one tells him because it only friends who are the reasons why not that they love you and care for you that's just how it is and it's so you kind of internalized that and then have very low self-esteem and but you kind of know your limitations right that's the problem like when I when I moved here was that I realize like a lot of the kids I went to school with man I wish they had the confidence you know it's like they are inflated sense of self drink this and get nervous I grew up around a lot of Koreans because I I did Taekwondo from the time I was young and they was around when I was younger I was in medical school so he's going through his CN training to be on the national team so while he was studying he would put his backpack on Phil's backpack up with books and run upstairs of the University run up and down stairs to get some additional workouts in he was trying to train for the US team while he was doing his residency and it was all through sheer will and he was explaining that to me about what it was like it's like you are never good never never does nothing ever good enough you know no matter what you do you could have done better you can work harder you can always do more work equals success and people of Asian descent Publican politics right off of pull yourself up by your bootstraps you don't even handouts the harder you work the more likely Wenatchee something that's why there's such a natural you know Ally to rely on this group block as a political group if you're Asian because there's so many Asian people that get in they made it more difficult it is raining managed that they have to do better than white people they have to do better than everybody else which is crazy lower the scores a little farther group than me. do you want to see more personality ultimately this is about you know like what Aristotle quality Louis right what is the loss of higher education what's the ultimate goal or Essence of higher education is it to Just Produce perfect cogs in the machine of the global economy or is it you know to produce engaged citizens or whatever it is right however you to find that question what the purpose of higher education you could Taylor your entrance methods to meet that and this case they decided Well you know we're going to instead of just looking at your GPA your essay we want to see one interview the person want to see what your personality is like can you thrive at Harvard are you going to be a good contributing member of of this University was downgraded like extracurriculars academics are so strong on standardized tests but when it came to personality they were very consistently downgraded the argument right but suck in general so you know if you're going to be like that I was coming to America like 10,000 miles away right from the place I want to go to school cuz like I could have just stayed there but I was looking for for for something that wasn't a monoculture t-shirt it is unfair it is kind of unfair if they were penalizing you based on race at the hard part of proof whether or not this was personality or race or some sort of you know other thing that they were selected for that happened to correlate with race and that's the part that that's hard and so they just sort of emphasized personality and emphasized social social interactions and in doing so they penalized Asians without being aware of it habits like we're kind of like you know we've been told that there's only one way to succeed work hard and Suma Kum laude and all these things were so so a lot of us kind of our are culturally a line on that and and you know the three kontrabida campus in the same way that you're active student union leader would involve another curriculars I don't know I don't know if they would Harvard want a diversity of of behaviors and interest oh yes it's like pouring stem people walking different stuff and you also want people that raise the bar really high in terms of performance you do other people's understanding of what's possible that's fine I'm like UC Berkeley State institution they abolish affirmative action UCLA all the UCS did look at the population 70 80% Nation people very uncomfortable to talk about differences in group up come because we have to kind of make everybody the same or else there must be some sort of systematics think they get away with discrimination against them and there's actually quite a big pro-trump Asian-American building block you know issue in New York city that has happened to under the Bellagio Maryland

		<div class="paragraph"> you know what do you think about how do you say his name Ray LaMontagne is that how you say it jobs in ship before and then just started doing it and I make sense found success later on I think that makes sense with a lot of people think people like Justin Bieber like he's kind of way harder Road the way harder road to try to figure out the new imagine are like at all things considered ice probably handling it okay right now has already happened on 24 he's rolling around on a G7 that's his day-to-day you know all the time because you don't pay attention to things I'm not like I'm not glued into pop culture but somehow like you just can't not know what Justin Bieber's up to once a month just walking around in the world anymore of it I would say that kid most people to be handed that type of existence and all of them scrutiny and all the s*** that comes along with that like that does things to people you know your personalities not even form yet I'm so grateful I got into this business 35 and I was saying that it's almost like if you made an epoxy right you know if you have epoxy is put up a couple ingredients in like there's one thing you mix it with another thing that hardens but if you had some s*** in that that's not supposed to be and it's fully developed you're not going to take that s*** out I'll give you added oil through some oil in the epoxy like I do you f*** that whole thing up that's kind of what you're doing to a person when you raise a person famous have you take some reality star from the time they're five and then they're in a sitcom in the movie and then you've gone through your whole unwise I really start but you've gone through your whole life if you're that person you Justin Bieber you've got your whole life under the under the eye people paying attention but you never had a moment like you did with your work for the railroad tracks or like you know I did going on the road for years or just some of the jobs that I had before it was ever comedian they don't have any of those don't don't have the wondering if you could pay your bill feeling they don't know that feeling they don't have the still feel like that I really had money or anything like that or any aspirations to own a house with those kind of things so it's just the kids now like I just don't there's no flamboyance if he lives a different life for people like Rihanna these they're like literally citizens of the world in any day of the week hotel and god-knows-where you know yeah God knows where it's a crazy way to live very bizarre and I couldn't do it man cuz there's no way I don't ever I don't ever want to wake up and have that kind of career cuz it takes so many people around you on a daily basis just to maintain and keep something a machine that large rolling logistically speaking that you become enslaved to the job you know to makes you high all these there's like this always this name like we have Superstar ex you know he puts his head right here and then everything below that just to make that thing go around and turns into this like a corporation really like 20 semi trucks and all this s*** you know when you got to go out and make that happen because now all these people depend on you for their livelihoods and careers and that's going to affect the artistic culturally speaking and if you want to do something different next time will now this massive fanbase isn't really going to f****** deal with that very well Boutique party we get it you guys are part of your school and then all sudden you know Paul's Boutique is like whoa what is this David Bowie Ziggy Stardust to doing a solo album in like 9 months or Luther Vandross and yeah those are huge classic amazing record you know you think Rod Stewart gets enough credit I don't I don't either I think that specially man faces and even those early solo records as those are some amazing albums as boys is incredible what they got too much p**** do you think his brain I like that song was that was there was something in that song right there was a guy trying to figure his life out hanging out with some chick roster with a Bad Axe play professional soccer for a Celtic or somebody wow he's like a really great soccer player when he was a kid but he was too small so we had another one right that like basically like you never going to see one of those again no I don't think so you never going to see a lot of things again nobody that's actually nobody that's actually that might know that's not necessarily true you might see more things now because that's true too I know ahead of myself.

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I like that's one of the things that New York has a large advantage over Los Angeles is interaction people are constantly on the subway and walking on the streets with everybody all different classes all different backgrounds and I think that's really good early contact with different people and it's the same with that's what I feel better ideas to early contact with different ideas really helps and that's that's kind of devoted my life to two that caused almost someone called him and Neo-Nazi and through just communicating with them and being friendly with them over a. Of many months he got them to quit they quit the clan on their own and didn't request it and then over the course of several years he's gotten more than 200 people to leave the clan leave Neo-Nazi organizations and he they give him the robes and their flags and you brought them all in here and he's inspirational human being but he essentially was reinforcing what you were saying that these people are never around anyone like one of the guys that he met initially was saying I've never had to buy a drink with a black man before and he's like how the impossible is like and he's like I've never. Never had a drink with black man and so he's like this is the first time ever having a drink with a black man you like making this big deal out of it and then eventually Daryl was going to his house and then eating dinner with us and hang out with them in it and then the guys that I can't do this anymore like why am I in the clan when he quit and he quit just from Darrell being this really friendly articulate brilliant guy who clearly didn't fit their Narrative of what they the racist depiction of what a black man is this group called Milwaukee had organised a conference that that put on a conference into thinking that for years and they had alongside you know if people like Sargon of akkad you know count dankula the guy who taught his pug to do the basically cuz you know when the conference is happening and then in antifa kind of found out about it they started protesting the conference a they called the the venue to basically you know get it canceled they said it was a Nazi rally Klan rally ironically you know the greatest irony is that that Daryl Davis was there and he got tainted as well so I start calling this the political one drop rule where what happen to you if you are associating with talking to somebody that has a whole range of people like normal distribution of people you will be tainted by the most right-wing person that you're in orbit with that's just how it goes and that's what happened to Daryl so when we will have the after-party to the conference and outside the bar the Pitman New Jersey people custom pool with their to the Pitman New Jersey people had a police had to station themselves outside of the bar and you know they were kind of protecting this event know what it's it's ridiculous because you know yes you might find Sergeant's politics objectionable but why is everybody who's associated with the conference also lumped in with us and why is the response that does need police protection it's just we're just talking about it it doesn't make any sense and it's this thing that it gets it just gets reinforced in that culture that this you know the culture of either 24 people that support antifa didn't understand the consequences of shutting down speech you think you just going to shut down speed Cindy platform people that have marginally offencive views and the problem with that is first of all you close the door for them to be influenced in a positive way or for other people to learn from them being influence in a positive way of all the way. down ideas is not stop a person from talking it's to combat those ideas with better ideas and then everyone around them gets to see the discourse when you have these debates online and people discuss these things online it benefits millions of people when you shut that down it benefits nobody but your calls and your cause is probably incorrect like your your ideas are probably wrong and then the case of Daryl Davis you're definitely wrong is not a Nazi so if you shot shutting that down and say they we're Nazis will you're wrong and your censoring people that are trying to get to the bottom of things and getting to the bottom of things mean discussing things are trying to figure out tenable Solutions or awarded comfortable middle ground that takes forever this is not like you know you have Christina Hoff Sommers and she has this discussion and and they pull fire alarms and and yelled at she's a Nazi like she's a feminist you guys are crazy like this everyone has to comply with woke ideology 100% with no deviance whatsoever and everyone has to take an impossible to pass purity test it's it's this is a dumb way to communicate that the person would shift to the right it was that she tried to see if that okay if you are if you are a good Christian you might get corrupted by fat ideas so we have to ban I don't know like Harry Potter books are bad in my household it's okay to ban all these because I wasn't allowed to celebrate Halloween yeah because it's always so concerned that the corruption is just going like they're going to drift to the right there never concerned that but somebody might be convinced by the arguments and go to that why I don't get that expose everybody to all idea why are we so concerned that that the individual that they're you know what the target I guess would be would be shipped it right and not ship that left his preaching some ridiculous thing and someone starts becoming indoctrinated and grab chords that the real problem is that these people that are being indoctrinated are gullible and their foolish that's the real problem and in your eyes they're they're going in the incorrect way you need to stop these people from being tricked into this right-wing ID does infantilizing yes I think that's that's what I couldn't do people are dumber than you you're smarter you know better you need to stop these people from being tricked into this right-wing ideology</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what year did you come over here how old are you 17 what was this shift like going from Singapore to United States you live in New York then play into any of the commonwealth countries cuz was a former British colony so all your credits or just transfer kind of more easily to university in England for example Australia but I chose America precisely for the First Amendment it was very weird people so it was pretty conformist in terms of talk about monocultures there there is a conformist right like there is the right school to go to the right path you take very entrenched and I really rebelled against that like can a grown up here I probably wouldn't be doing this right now it wouldn't just wouldn't matter but when somebody says I can't like like do not touch wet paint in like also there were a lot of culture shock that I had to adapt to you know for start is it definitely felt like a bit of a step back for me in terms of how intensive comfort of look like Center living the United States country compared to Singapore and the infrastructure was kind of broken the potholes your health care what the hell is up with that so with a step back in material Comfort swimming and in Singapore you know if you grew up even middle-class at the 50th percentile family can afford a domestic helper so many Singaporean kids insect 90% of all the kids I know growing up all grew up with Maids so enrage and so if you measure employment at Country it's it's in some economic measurements the way they do it it's almost like it's over employee unemployment problem because of turn Den Outlet height the United States practices what you call Efficiency wages which is you know they the kind of pay people little bit more to to extract the better performance incentives matter are you in like smoke, no big government has a problem, solution it's it's about Effective Government and I think that's something that the super government had really perfected it's it's effective governance not about the size we're going to I don't care whether this is a policy that people respond to incentives and if you want to encourage a certain kind of behavior you there carrots and sticks to do basically cards that behavior and so it's there are things that the government would do in a way that we just would never fly here where were you beat me in a we treasure civil liberties too much anyway which I personally came here for that reason but I'll give you an example social cohesion is engineered in Singapore so there's isn't very very Multicultural multi-ethnic Society you have Malay Muslims Indians Hindus Chinese who are Buddhist Christians and you know it's all living. on an island city-state that's about 5 million times of population and how the government manages this Multicultural project is that 80% of people actually live in public housing that's very high social listening right public housing for you and each block has to mimic the racial demographics of the whole country is the total makeup of the country is 60% Chinese 20% million Muslims it has to follow so you can't have basically an area like Birmingham in the UK we're all the Muslim immigrants or or you know something like Dearborn Michigan or Minnesota with all the Somali immigrants you are forcing and have you know neighbors that are just not not your own kind again or Minnesota with all the Somali immigrants you are forced into great it's a it's a way to force people to integrate and have you know neighbors that are just not not your own kind and that's how they've created this like national identity that's very strong</div>

I don't I don't know about that but I do know that one time they actually executed a Australian citizen who was on Transit Airport quite a bit he was deadly trafficking it zero zero tolerance policy very much part of neoliberal economic policies still track a lot of foreign investment right because the highest income tax bracket is like maybe 13% it's very low on this almost no welfare at least in the sense of how we understand welfare but there's a lot of the hybrid system there's a lot of 00 state taxes very easy to sew businesses to set up their Multinational Corporation Headquarters in Asia because the other alternative would be maybe China but China would probably end up stealing all your you know your corporate Secrets your property but this is the country that protects rule of law attract investment you say like what's in my what's in my region and how can I be how can I have a competitive Advantage so that was that was housing for released developing and gained a lot of traction I didn't like it cuz I don't like rom-coms and light come on the premises like the girls at American Asian girl is like dating this guy from Singapore she doesn't know he's rich and she finds out on the plane there it's like the most bulshit thing it's just conspicuous consumption I mean it's got some you know the city look beautiful and in fact I kind of grew up with some people that live that lifestyle but I just don't like and I mean it's it's got some you know the city looks beautiful and in fact I kind of grew up with some people that live that lifestyle but I just don't like that kind of movie</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> and I have a question for you though cuz like you know you do talk a lot about like woke stuff kind of going unlock rate doesn't not bother you though but Bernie that he aligns himself with some characters who were super woke I think a lot of though the wokeness is a sign of a cultural shift in the right direction less racism or homophobia less fill in the blank all those all the things that we that trouble us about like evil behavior and even greet corporate greed all these these things that trouble us about the influence that money has on politics and burning clearly stands against all that stuff and I think that when you see is this woke stuff you know it goes among you have to look at it on a spectrum it's like the crazy antifa people who demand 100% compliance with woke ideology or they'll hit you in the head of the bike lock versus people who want single mothers to be able to have free education and free healthcare and give them the economic support that they have to raise their family and hopefully give their children a chance at achieving a successful comfortable life World versus suppress them versus keep them in this f***** up system that just throws them in the meat grinder with everybody else treat this country like Community like try to do our best to help the people that are in a disenfranchised position cuz there's so many try to do our best to in some way economically uplift all these deeply impoverished sections of our country that's those are the good aspects woke ideology see all woke ideology isn't just you need 78 different gender pronouns and enough to comply with but it's also for the way that you behave then things get ugly most people reasonable people if they could have conversations with folks even if they disagreed on certain things they'd find themselves somewhere in a comfortable comfortable discussion where you could at least sort through the ideas and try to figure out why you think the way you think and why I think the way I think why what how we disagree and are you right or am I am I wrong like I want to know these kind of conversations like trying to figure out if the person who opposes your philosophy or your perspective is right and you're wrong it's very uncomfortable for people so what do they do they just f****** s*** on anybody was on the other side and they don't talk to him this very little exchange of ideas in between the right in the lab. I really like talking to his Dan Crenshaw who is a right-wing guy yeah that was great then using his platform course he's using his platform he's getting good ideas out there Jimmy Dore amazing so accurate I like people crazy laugh cuz they just makes me laugh so I could just watch for that purpose alone we need more discussions the thing is if you like people got mad at me for having people on the podcast that are far right people particularly in the far past week many years ago and want two things it's hilarious and they said his show has had this person that person that person all the all the negatives 100 + episodes and you list like five or six noise if that defines the show that you have had play don't like if you workout yeah yeah I'm a bald cage fighting commentator you know bench great right it's just there's a lot of the time they just enjoy it works really well there's a lot of people to like racing cars 2 you know they just enjoy the mechanical aspect of racing a car it's kind of the same thing when you do you do something to your body to juice your body out to make it stronger and faster and work better doesn't mean you're dumb but this stuff is Insidious because it's bad enough to be in political silos we're now in cultural silos and they're mapping on each other right so what I shouldn't like so people with they like ouu I'm surprised you watch WWE Hardy Boyz and Lita I grew up with that stuff so people be surprised and and they will push back on it and it's it's it's increasingly become that way like from a person's consumption habits what they like I'll be able to map what what politics they will have more likely to have him we shouldn't be going down this route well-read educated people actually enjoy watching the UFC so talk to so many of them like your fan like Robert Downey jr.

		<div class="paragraph"> I love Andre Ward for a bunch of reasons but one for the fact that that guy undefeated gold medalist to division world champion because you know what walked away about that he's better off for boxing even for boxing outside of fighting you know he knows like he's so smart man he's so smart and so disciplined he just so disciplined he knows like there's no reason no reason to come back the right way to do it this this big money and coming back but there's also a big brain damage the ego after you retire is the biggest fight of your life like just because of who he is you think that stop yourself from the money the glory one more time the possibility if you imagine coming out of retirement and beating like Canelo ever mellow Alvarez and to be able to like you know what it's better for me and it's better for boxing if I stay retired and keeps sitting ringside talk about these fights in the way I do pause this issue with his right shoulder you know his right shoulder was basically broken most of his career and he got it fixed before the second kovalev fight and he actually wind up hurting kovalev real bad with a right hand when she if you watch his career use like a left-handed Fighter for the majority of us is supraspinatus is like ripped off like I was really f***** up and he tried to rehab it with bands instead of going to surgery when he was young and so most of his career he beat the best fighters in the world Broncos guys handed which is even more insane even more insane and then you know had the surgery rehab Tiffany said still not 100% what happens when an under-appreciated Legend you know in the terms of the mainstream boxing Viewpoint I don't think that the mainstream public really appreciates how great he was who their dad or grandfather was more so than he's getting it now if for whatever reason they never really captured the Public's imagination even though they were great you know like Marlon Starling was a fantastic welterweight knocked out Mark Breland who was actually now Deontay Wilder's trainer when Mark was coming from the Olympics and you know he was just really Long Tall welterweight and he fought star installing wasn't really wasn't appreciated enough and Starling you know Stanley put it on and you realize that there's this guys out there that for whatever reason people don't appreciate them as much they should yeah don't deserve the shots that they continue to get but because they bring an audience with their s*** talking or with their Antics and all the the show that they put on it's better than the fight are you doing what are the hardest motherfukers on earth when it comes to boxing you're not just Mexican you are the size of the man you just don't know we got like he won something like 31 World title fights some insane number he's had the record of world title wins which is also like an unattainable goal is Julio Cesar Chavez what do you hope to my job for can you hope to get in Legacy like I almost feel bad for the guy like because there's going to be so much going on in his head and put him in a place where he's at but yet he's talented these f****** he's a good fighter like his skills his ability to put hands on people are very good but I think also there's something about growing up wealthy just impossible like you kind of have to have some part of your life that was f***** up and you didn't think it was going to work out where will you didn't think it was there was a future and there's a burn that never goes out just like a little fire that never goes out either has a greater challenge than adversity yes it is man there's something about Comfort this makes b****** out of people possibly remove yourself from that Comfort it's very few human beings are able to really achieve greatness when they grow up with with great wealth and privilege is something about that that life of leisure and and and knowing that everything's going to be okay you know like your dad made 15 million dollars going to be fine you know there's something about that that just for whatever reason it just haunts haunts people brightly inside him almost like a resentment for his father unfortunately helping love could Propel you feel like even come anywhere near his legacy that you actually have to hate the guy just to be like fire burning bright enough to attain anything close to what he did feel bad for his dad to but I've one more the Canelo fight was a rough one too but you know outclass them you know Canal was just just a better fighter Adam anymore and it was from a blatant foul like he looked okay right yeah maybe there's something going on that we couldn't see but he looked up in the nearest you know took videos from the hospital the next day with tape on his nose and like</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I don't know if you know this but like you said there was a time when the only way you can have a voice or certainly comment on boxing or MMA or Sports is if you got hired by major networks that a reach or people can see you have to die to get that job the gym is a fairly fairly new and I had you still like mini DV days and I had a camera that I would use to shoot sparring sessions and because Freddy has a gym where there are World Championship Fighters preparing for title fights on television the class or fighter that's in there on any given day sparring or like Main Event ticket selling Marquee guys and I'm in there shooting their sparring session any reverse anybody and I'm using the money I'm making selling the sparring footage back to the fighters to pay my gym dues that's how I started and it's like in journalism restaurant equipment like as a faculty can I do is show and so I'm coming like the headline news in whatever f****** kid greater things is important and who won the football game and you know this kind of s*** before dudes I got to come up with a way to do that I start shooting sparring sessions and in this this is like James Tony is still fighting and there's a guy named Danny Green who is a Australian fighter wildly famous there but doesn't have like Global audience he wants to fight James no real money in it for James but if you know James Toney this is no shrinking violet this man is like insane Wilder pumped up till I get to this day with every day that was James Toney at Wild Card boxing it right so this guy flight from Australia walks into the gym and you know what a sacred Place those are like the main fighter at Kenny Jam the guy who likes is the representation of the toughest dude in that dog dog you don't just walk into that guy is Jim Zorn talkingshit talkshit the middle of a round right exactly all throughout rounds this guy comes to the James gymstars talkingshit James like getting the ring right now the last 10 Rounds I'll fight you anywhere and get the fight he takes tell James looks good. Oh my goodness and this is James in his prime he looked like he was a f****** heavyweight but that's nice of them was James heavyweight this point at this time there really wasn't any boxing Apprentice speak of ESPN you might get a Mike Tyson knockout clip be Fighters training there is no websites for fight and after this thing got done I'm like a you know Danny Green doesn't want to eat so I'm just going to go home and record over it and yeah because I need every VHS tape I can use to keep the money in my pocket I can't just be stockpiling footage nobody wants but before I get a chance and tape over it I get a call from a Cyclemax boxing and I bet Tyler like Boston website I want to say this is probably close to thousand by weighing day he'll get down with this is how this is how James like rock everyday he'd be just banging guys amazing footage time currently a wild-card and he's to spar James which is like somebody to talk to him what are you thinking f****** good shape and James getting tired was their mamas in this or James look really tired the thing about James Toney at this time he always look really tight always seemed like he was being lazy he's always leaning on Fighters but what you can't hear is the thud of those shots like he just turned it on Freddy in the background by the end of it still is Danny Green still seems like he's kind of in it it's not like anything that Danny's doing making an impression of the end it was over like that Daddy had enough Jim Moore's what I did with this footage ultimately was I took it and went to an editor named Brian Hardy was an editor for Mac boxing at the time and he got Doug Fisher who's now the editor-in-chief of Ring magazine and I to commentate that footage as though you're watching it on HBO right so that's doing the color I'm calling the fight like I got in the Lampley and he's a Kellerman and we showed the whole thing I talked about the context of what had happened like I told you and we're calling this show Jim Wars blew up it was like the first big boxing like thing on the internet at all and so I would go to round a different gym and get fired Greek let me shoot the session and turn it into a show call Jim Moore's and so this like the way these guys now get there like phones in their cameras and they go interview Fighters all the s*** I started that that wasn't a thing before I started doing I'm the one who created this like medium by which you now receive boxing news so we're in trajectory in life was changed at a boxing gym and never to look back and we will fight her own point I'm never was away Freedom release like all of those young man angst boxing was that it was an intricate part of my life I spent hours in the gym to where I had to figure out a way to make some money there so I can continue to eat and pay for it and that was my way of doing it be interviewing Fighters is now like my timer friends because everybody thinks are Reinventing the wheel now I can't shoot anybody sparring or anything like that so that she had to go away but the way that I relate to and understand Fighters and what it is like that's inside them that's Barry Spears in the driving them I think is unique because although I would never ever classify myself as a fighter that's such a unique and and cherish like battery that you can really hold if that's really what you do I'm a lawyer to remain like I I am my own way I forged a career I created something that didn't exist and had to fight every step along the way to make it a thing a unique and and cherish like battery that you can really hold if that's really what you do I'm a lawyer too and I mean like I I am my own way I forged a career that created something that didn't exist and Ida fight every step along the way to make it a thing</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what's the craziest story unboxing the years Errol Spence Jr surviving that f****** Ferrari crash that's the craziest or the year when you see that car flip like that and the fact that he got out I would like a chipped tooth I mean a spunkers think I didn't ever see Phil. I never say that thank God he didn't have a f****** people. Cuz if he did there's no way he'll be dead probably or f****** severely injured you know does that week when that happen and it was one of those things where it reminded me when I first heard the news of Paul Williams yes I realize real life with all its dangers and all the other ways that people can meet tragedy and heard of the other overcome and that's a point you almost want to keep him shelter in a box between fight so that nothing happened nothing can paint what's going to happen in the ring but he's guys are just like everybody else to that degree Lakeshore United mean like you just can't you can't know if we'll ever see the Errol Spence that we saw before hopefully we do and better how badly was he injured from what I understood and I follow this very closely not badly at all like you're not wrong like he from what I understand he had issues like teeth being knocked out lacerations on his face no broken bones no permanent injury whatsoever it's crazy but the mental side of it is that each individual two-handled to be faced with death like that the moment was when you were flying through the air and not knowing if you're going to live you don't know how people people adjust to that so bad because him and Crawford goddamn want to fight that would be God damn lomachenko was taller and I wish you was a bigger fighter you know it cuz lomachenko vs Crawford was really the fight that I would want to see cuz those I mean I believe Errol Spence Jr is right there with them he's is phenomenal fighter particular what he did with Garcia but lomachenko and Terence Crawford it to Masters it when I look at them in terms of what they do to their opponents that the tune don't let me check with that crazy movement footwork it's but Terence Crawford just figures people out here the way switch stances he'll start out South Park start at Orthodox in the switch up on you start boxing you out he puts all the data into that computer and then starts finding your weaknesses and then he gets nasty with you and I love. I mean one thing I like about him so f****** meanie is what is an IT want to do is go down he gets a kick out of it yeah there's that Killer Instinct you know how this is going to turn out time in the Mikey Garcia fight could have happened with lomachenko I-35 I don't think you should ever fight a 40 or but I think he'd say that same but when you see with Mikey Garcia it would happen to him when he went up again Errol Spence arrows is way bigger and stronger and better even better I think him and hopefully he's okay hopefully he's okay and he said he's getting back to the gym and getting back after him and Terrence his stuff like that is supposed to fight each other is there a an idea of like I believe I think he's thinking like a man like really back of the Deepwater I don't think he's the type of dude I'd like to see that one life</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> see Combat Sports today and you see like the landscape of boxing I I feel personally that this is an amazing time I mean I feel like the heavyweight division has never been more exciting and more turbulent because there's so many great Fighters now to have Andrew he's jump out of nowhere and knock out Anthony Joshua I think was a godsend for the sport because all the sudden you say like who is chubby Mexican just f***** up this dude looks like a god first Mexican heavyweight champion but it's also like wow this is a crazy division look you got the Deontay just knocked the f*** out of Luis Ortiz would that one punch the forehead you like what the f*** you got the rematch with Tyson Fury's coming up in two weeks right not even write less than 20 second my goodness what you're talkin about earlier is exemplified and what happened after the fight where you see what you said chubby guy that's very heavy as though he won the lottery or you want to scratch off and it should just happen it doesn't remind people of what the heavyweight division is one punch can change the fight is a real thing f***** up there on that rematch that rematch was a disaster so it was so clearly unprepared when you wait to 80 I was like oh my God knew him like my own know I heard Whispers that didn't believe it I believe I believed it cuz it's so hard not to all the sudden you're the f****** man and I don't know where and maybe he was convinced he could do it again you know he's hitting the pads and look pretty good hitting the bag look pretty goods are not f*** that guy up again but Anthony Joshua have a totally different game plan this time and to see Anthony Joshua stick-and-move like that was interesting was like wow yeah it's a cliche but it again losing might have been the best thing that ever happened to him I don't know about that I don't know about that you know I mean I think it's great that he got his title back but I felt like one thing that happened in that fight that Disturbed me was even though Ruiz came in out of shape and clearly didn't look like he was prepared correctly Joshua didn't did never really enforces will on him he never really had a moment was the f*** out of them wears like you know I trained hard for this fight I'm going to dominate you now now I'm going to take you out the way you took me out there was none of that it was boxing to stick-and-move make sure you get the decision make sure you get the decision that is in stark contrast with Deonte finishes fights which is why that matchup is so intriguing which is why no matter what happens between the two of them hopefully they remain undefeated for their own sake and can they make that unification fight I saw his commitment to discipline Joshua as a good thing so it's definitely a good thing because he won the title back but when you make the argument who's the best heavyweight in the world if you have to look at it on paper I don't think it's him right now I think it's Tyson Fury or Deontay Wilder depending on what happens on the 22nd I lean towards Deonte because he can close the show at any moment that 12-round I was when I was in bed watching the fight I want oshit I popped up City knocked him out he knocked and then what the f*** arises he gets through the garage and then he wins the remainder the round like this is insane and even Rock tiante one point I might this isn't insane fight and then it was a draw and I don't think I'm paper is really a draw I think that's horseshit I think I'm paper Tyson Fury one more round spot upset with a draw because the way Deontay knocked him down and then knocked him down on the way to knock him down the 3rd and 12th round and you can almost count for like three points. So crazy just about any any other fight in a countless fight that you've covered where the the main highlight of the fight is just a guy getting up crazy crazy crazy the right hand in the left hook behind it and then him walking off like this can rage for days but I don't know that for sure this guy beats back out of that guy beat the other guy won't know until they faced each other and Joshua Wilder well unless Tyson Fury Calles Wilder and Tyson Fury Tails while they're in as I can to a Joshua Anthony Joshua Youtube if he can get some if there's talk of that kind of s*** then I want to see that fight but if my dream matchup right now is the rematch that's the dream matchup the dream matchup is the 22nd I am so f****** pump for that rematch Jack schitt I'm the I'm taking the night off I'm sitting right from the f****** TV sweaty Palms MMA but I do love boxing</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> dude this is getting to this man we have this conversation at the, strong like you got to come on the podcast we had talked about this because you are a part of probably the most iconic boxing interview of our day you would Deontay Wilder when Deontay Wilder freaked out on you it became this huge huge f****** thing to this day that he puts it on his Instagram hashtags till this day he sells sweatshirts with till this day on them there's a store that's adjacent to the Barclay Center it's connected to the Barclay Center and it's full of s*** it says tennis day on it he had a grand opening there I was invited to it automatically or do they just your Busey the side of your face when you see him angry as far as heavyweight of all time I mean Mike Tyson's right up there might see off stay off ring outside the ring Deontay is a sweetheart he's a really nice guy so to see him angry outside the ring is kind of weird I had them on the podcast he couldn't be a nicer guy he's a really nice guy and so to see him angry at YouTube and like giving you crazy eyes I was like and when you explained it was like yeah that's what you doing it interview you you want someone to expand and see what do you mean by that this is not like the first day we met set timer for an hour and the moment some people might not be aware of exactly what happened so just try to act showman in boxing heavyweights my guys are giant first time they met this is December 18th so you also know that fighting Sports boxing MMA there is a aspect like everybody's culture bring something to it the Irish fighter feels like he's got a certain style he's got a certain history he's going to claim to the warrior Legacy same for the British fighter of course the American fighter but both of these guys come from what's like an underclass of their society Travelers gypsies in England fighting is part of their tradition almost like it is to Mexicans in Mexico it's something that they do that Bond the clan is they they believe in history of it obviously not the waters from Alabama darkest midnight he is a descendant of slaves for sure okay he's got a history coming to any fight bringing what he experiences in this country to this element of the faceoff one man one when Tyson Fury's on stage for the press conference it something cuz that's going to say you know I'm coming from a fighting people my people have been fighting for 200 years the culture of Travelers of gypsys is one of their fighting man I'm a fighting man until then if they say about themselves and each other so that's what he's bringing you this already but that's how he's challenging Wilder the 400 years according to talking about the black experience in America slavery all in all alike but mind you he's talking to a British fighter he's talking to a world audience it's not like he's fighting Dominic Brazil it's two Americans probably not going to get that much International attention the world communities years you know I know you know cuz we grow but I'm letting you know what we're talkin about the world doesn't know that I travel the world and not just not Steep and black American history I've had conversations with him he loves to talk about the plight of the black man in America and how it relates to his career how he feels and you know disadvantages certain ways and he carries a man to another ways you could Champion a black American certain ways and he's a victim of white American other ways when I see his argument happening I'm going to go home okay well this is definitely a moment but I'm not a pool reporter right so in this particular instance it's unusual for me to be part of the scrums when they call it collection of reporters everybody's kind of shouting questions I'll just trying to evoke responses my turn bar where would you buy with like you know Dave Chappelle on hanging out after Thanksgiving mail this one it to be honest I'm thinking let me throw something out because I know what he's talking about and I also know that the audience around in the world especially may not have caught that reference but he is neither Watermark right now it's Thursday in the fight Saturday across from the experience at least three months if not years at 10 weeks ramped-up rant right becomes off stage yet and a couple of other questions and then just to be sure because I've been doing this a long time not an idiot I know he's aunt and I wanted to get the question clearly Deonte radio Raheem he doesn't know me but because he does you just said your people have been fighting for 400 years okay first of all I'm in the midst of my question that part of the question became incredibly important you said you were people celebrating our PR people said of our people calling the guy I'm not speaking for him he said my people have been fighting for him if he had said our people I would have said our people but I can't take possession of your quote it's not me saying it laser focus turns to me he's already at 10 like there's no ramp up at this time and he starts shouting my face like your people too so you know what I'm talking about he said don't try to bait you know what I'm talking about when I say these things around like can you tell them what you talkin about different interviews and off-camera I know exactly what he's talking about and I know that this is the moment that he finally gets to talk about it the people who have never been listening to him before but problem he starts being shot in your people and I'm like it took me him he couldn't he needed to keep saying it but you know why you were saying you're my people to my people to fighting for 400 years to this day to this day and so it what I wanted when I wanted what I thought was happening was that okay this moment now has become about him like attacking me because he thinks I'm attacking him he thinks because I do know he's talked about it Dental air quotes Uncle Tom and numerous names I've been called on the internet since as though I'm trying to pretend like this day or till this day the debate on that first of all go look up the history of look up the history believe in Google go Google that shitt see what I'm talkin about you know what I'm talkin about man you know when I dare you to sit up there and say this plane you know what I'm talkin about man fighting people you know we've been fighting for 1in Steel fighting to this day to this day rental Mario Bro old man in the end what does or 19 or welcome to the new age of clips and things being taken out of context this is not the first time I've had an interview that has gotten to be a big fat people going to talk about it bro I had no f****** concept of what was it happened to my night like I like basically reporter like this okay well that was dramatic who got a hot one gallon might get me are you a few hundred thousand if not a million views maybe like this is something you know it's something of a success like okay we got him no expressways it is in that moment something that we don't usually see do for me that in and of itself is something of a victory like you who created a moment here where you got to see inside the Champs aren't going to see like his passions when I get home though I got to take a nap so I'm woken up by Chimes on my phone looks so bad like I'm paragraphs especially about having her like you know teach people like basic not to be Uncle Tom's and how you got it like straighten it out and I'm the pin cushion maybe is any possible way this is good bro everybody likes to f*** that guy YouTube video let it sit there for about an hour and then start writing account look like upset at somebody over something this is a this is a train on fire off the rails mean and of course the more people respond with celebrities and you know that other fighters in a like the more emboldened he is to double down like hell this is a moment it's not selling well you know what I mean they've been giving him stick overseas for not being known anywhere they're saying you can walk down the street and you know any harm to this video or people in New York like do they know Deontay Wilder has he made a whole video of him saying no he's knocking everybody out WBC heavyweight champion you can't get the fight to unify like with Joshua they're saying he's a nobody essentially can't he's not worth the money cuz nobody knows who he is he's fighting or he could have possibly Pitt Fury is incredibly technical fighter no one thinks of Deontay Wilder ignition like they're thinking this guy get out class he loses belts this way and not be making this is only made a s*** ton of money for that fight so now that all the pictures on him and like I said it's a subject he loves to talk about he's a hero he's like a champion everywhere people didn't even know the fight was happening until this meme just is in her inbox has people people and it'll speak to your soul oh my goodness the flagship moment for black what people do tell like you know the black oxygen mask on and it says you still in your parents phone me. out of my control and then I have to start to think about what my role really is it's not about me that's not what I do isn't so that people can feel one way or another about me it's really again taking myself back that initial moment of showing him soon about the fighter that they haven't seen let's get a look inside this guy and get him to share something usually I just verbally that they didn't know or that you did was it you didn't come to the room expecting a share and I support people understanding the culture from which he we come as black American I wanted to give him the stage to do exactly that didn't turn out like I expected like civil rights I guess black power black information what we're experiencing beat it still run at that time in 2018 did you think about it like in retrospect how could I have phrased that better be sure you did right what could you have said cuz you wanted to get that out of there you want to get him to expand on it I think that it was exactly the right thing at the right time I couldn't have predicted in a million years it would have went that way but that's the way we're supposed to go better and he had given them more reason thoughtful answer we wouldn't be sitting here he were made less money to about my side of the story summer garden some people don't know it's me and I'm so happy for that oh my God every day since there's been over a year now someone somewhere every time I've left my home and sometimes while I'm still in it has shout it in my face oh my God oh my God yeah oh my God it's something that captured everybody's attention in a moment I've been anything else know it had to be in his eyes cuz he's so wrapped up getting ready for that fight and so angry they take the glasses off yeah you must mention your parents will you know him right so you probably weren't shittin your pants but you probably like very uncomfortable I absolutely was not going to pay that wasn't in fact in the in the exchange and quite call but I'm just trying to figure out what's happening in the beginning because I didn't understand like the rage being directed at me for unemployment for a minute and much more common Reason fashion I let him lay out what it was about what I expect to have the first time lot of people have seen it not a fraction of the people who sing that I don't know what's really going to happen in this moment but it's doing my job I can't be afraid to do that so whatever happens if this is what's going to be you got a great perspective on it though you're so right that without that moment blowing up like that the fight doesn't become as big as it is the mean doesn't exist you don't become more popular right and he even did like a segment before fight on Showtime I went through like it actually created a moment that put him in position to be the kind of Representative of that issue that he wanted to be and it gave me an opportunity to be seen even though in a lot of Corners initially negatively I was also seen as a journalist who pulled that out like I'm the other guy I'm the guy on the other side of that camera that yes. That moment and I've been doing this for my fanbase people who know my work order sent me they know that I think they know I'm not an idiot and I I like to think they know I'm not a sellout but they don't really know me because I don't ever make it about me I don't like this everywhere having is a three or four five is my tire life entirely showing up and every press conference find every way in a tree media workout trying to get something out of the fighter to be consumed by the audience in a way that maybe they hadn't seen it before not just for the audience to say I want the fighter to get in touch with something like there's so many platitude questions in the same old s*** and nobody's really like big a deal. One-dimensional characters these aren't actual Bulls these are just glad it is Our Fathers and Sons there like they have civil rights issues they have hoping to bring this thing they have like depression we know all the things that Fighters go through but they don't want to show you one side because they don't want to show any boner ability and their fans aren't interested in like anything other than who's up and who's down if that's all you're feeding them so I try to get out of the way I don't want to get in front of the work so when people see me in his light allowed I thought many times and send it to this guy's credit never even even though even the 20 minutes after you're right we didn't know each other we do have a history and he is now knowing the moment I created and knowing what he did to me in that moment has always been especially gracious he's always been especially helpful I can always get and knowing what he did to me in that moment has always been especially gracious he's always been especially helpful I can always get access to him we have a bug now like we share this day</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> what is it what else is exciting for you on the horizon boxing wise what it what are you looking at not talk about Pacquiao we talked about the welterweight division because because he's 40 and he's not in the news all the time he's not at press, so we don't talk about it when he's got a sign that sometimes in these conversations forget yellow he's a world titleholder he just dominated a guy that there's no way it is 80 should be able to dominate considering who keep their man was two years prior before his surgery Pacquiao could ruin everybody s*** like but what do you think about do you think that he would ever step up and fight Terence Crawford at this stage of his career also I don't think that any more than they want to make the spin scrubber fight do they want to put pack out in that kind of Harm's Way and give top ranking is being an opportunity to Dethrone him like you know he's with Bahamian can't now it's the same with spent so that is going to protect him that he's not going to have to say whether or not he really wants he can get it Manny Pacquiao inks deal with Paradigm sports management who represent Conor McGregor oh Jesus that's what they're going to do Manny Pacquiao without the wind out here it is an opportunity for Manny Pacquiao to make a fuckload of money mean that's how I look at it I look at it for many to make a hundred million bucks watch Floyd Mayweather box circles around them irritated by the people that think the Conners chance either Errol Spence or Crawford I would I would pay either one of those fights I would like that I would like that's what I would like to say I think while man is 40 I mean after the Keith Thurman fight he has shown that he still like a legit world-beater you know and Terence Crawford is the cream-of-the-crop my opinion I want to see that you don't be more exciting excited than both of those fights Shawn Porter if I to ya I don't believe what I believe in world champions all there's way too many of them every weight division this f****** like oh undefeated Fighters are the only ones that are worth talking about that's them if it is one thing I love about the UFC and MMA culture. Is that losing a fight doesn't mean losing your whole f****** Brandt like right if you go out there comport yourself well leave it all in the Octagon you live to fight another day still respect the effort you put forth like they recognize that if you're fighting guys at your level you'll win some and you lose some and hopefully win more than you lose and that's how you become the man but not but losing some doesn't make you a b**** does it make you like a bum why I think Manny's kind of proving that I mean everyone has put him in up orbit yeah just put it in orbit around Jupiter that is the most electric boxing atmosphere I've ever been a part of every televised my entire adult life they knew when they were singing that Anthem the Mexicans were singing like the Mexican Anthem before the fight and I was sitting there with a friend of mine also a fellow journalist Sean's to tell and we were sitting in the Press row we're sitting like we I didn't want to be bothered with all the but yeah Marina goes on the Press Road so I found seats like up above the ring and when they were singer Anthony looking each other like something is about to happen when he knocked out Manny Pacquiao he should have interesting I thought he would have had another one she never fought anybody again in that moment and there's something about especially Latino Fighters it's like they almost kind of have to keep going like all the greats kept going all the great Shabbos kept going away past he should have you know and then you know I mean so so many of them just keep going they dig and her brother Duran you know kept going wherever it's at mean it's an addiction it's a lifestyle and if you still believe you can do it like I'm feel better than most of those guy why not why not keep doing more W who doesn't want one more w</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I'm really interested to see what happens with Tyron and Leon Edwards you know they're fighting next that's a big fight very hard fight it is it is it it's a hard fight for both guys but it is stylistically matches up well for most guys because Aaron has a lot of successes with it would Southpaw guys completely Dominate and control going on and we are never just a done better at that with guys that he feels that he keep up with but with a guy like Tyron Woodley that I can wrestle like Tyron Woodley that's got power like him I wonder how he's going to do what I feel like Leon gets the least amount of attention when you come out to lightly top-flight world-class Fighters he's a top-flight world-class fighter but he gets the least amount of attention of those guess purse whatever we are trees this is the first fight you're actually starting to hear his voice like exactly who is Leon and the best 40-yard – so you going are you sucker punch somebody backstage and you are there any rush you out of London before it breaks can get a hold of you for the London boys came back and also I mean yeah that that's kind of unfortunately for me on that's when you're in a foreign country and you commit assault usually they lock you the f****** they got him out of there like she's like the thing is that the price for that next fight I hope so because of because of the way that think I'm the type of guy to wear anything you say can and will be used against you inside that octagon out your court of law I exactly is that guy I'm the judge the jury and executioner in there and and that that's how I approach it you just sign the contract to go fight the guys I get obsessed with the fact that I'm wanting to say something I'm I'm I'm waiting for them to say some verdant the guys that don't really have to say anything else have anything negative to say it's a little tougher to go in there and get you know and get and get angry at fight them and I'm like how you look at I want them to say something that's doing interview that pops up but my Google alerts on you know I might someone might for my teammate only boom someone did this interview about this check it out if I have time I watch it all he said that okay you know a guy you know what it's funny to see the way it's shifted like the crew his career shifter is about to be known for a long time a long time running the mail guy would win some lose some win some lose some I mean you don't not that long ago he was losing you know but any credit to his team as well you know they've done a good job at at picking the right fights to really get him to where he is now but you know what actually happened went on a South American game show before you went and did that look at piggy fight looking pictures really liked post Wonderboy wasn't it of the the huskiness on his part but it was at some point like missing like everyone's buying into the hype this is what I'm saying that that they've done a good job at creating this hype by picking the fights to wear once I was a gamble the Ben askren fight was a gamble you know you would not fight you take all that hype that this guy has which this guy didn't belong in there in the first place but previously early on his career you can make the argument that yes but at that point in his career he didn't belong in there but he goes out there lets you been asking just take him down it doesn't Ben askren does you wouldn't be having this conversation right now so he goes That's a Gamble and their part and the gamble paid off he went in they took all that hide from that then who's the next guy the guy that you know another guy that can win some lose some but has a ton of high because you just fought Conor goes in there and fights Nate now that fight turns out the way it did you get all this hide now you got all these people thinking oh my God this guy's a killer where has he been this and now it's the same guy that was 300 pounds not too long ago you do yeah but but don't he was always that guy that said you know what I'm not I'm not this cliche I'm not playing this character I'm not doing this you know I'm just a real fighting this but that you're showing up at f****** press conference is looking like the knockoff of Scarface template don't you think that's wise like to know it is what it is what it is what it is when did look what he did that last for all my God he took the biggest L of that night like that was corny you want to wear the robe you want to stand there and you said he was holding that Silverbell like eBay actually think this is a real belt the BMF what did you think about the MLP Cowboys they they needed all day today but you know it if they they get loud enough and then it hears them and Dana sees that there is a very smart man greatest promoter ever seen you know it's a jump on that you know you looking a new Corvette you go that's a beautiful car and you'll get a Ferrari go that's a better looking car that's better looking Bentleys sterling silver Gold Edition some it means seems like the lighting not it's sterling silver it's like that kind of think it's gold well if you beat him you get that bill to I want that s*** I want it will just deal with it if you had it with both of them would you do with it in my closet went to the camera turn to him during the last pay-per-view a f****** pop was gigantic everybody went crazy when they saw him yeah I mean the hype is real Woodley fight even though he might get with me that they were making him the favor not fighting like you guys are crazy you're crazy in this guy's already fought one of the best strikers twice and in Wonderboy and beat them both times not just that he was the only one that hurt him like he hurt Wonderboy bad and both of those fights Wonderboy never heard him so you got the who's arguably one of the best strikers to ever do it no matter what division we wanted was a fantastic kickball yeah I would like that so I'm sure we'll even a little afraid in that fight because it's like to think so I guess you have to be I think he with all the hype they were playing behind them you have to because that's what makes you saying as a champion is that little fears like you guys look who's making these odds beats me Specialties rankings to I'm like they've got this kid at number three he hasn't fought before hasn't fought number one number two doesn't phone number 505 number 6 phone number one number two doesn't phone number 505 number six and what is he in the hospital</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> is the status of Adonis Stevenson is did he recover okay now I mean he's not his former self but he's certainly like I think living a good life for you cuz I know that was like that was one of the more recent like Superstar guys wound up having always going to now the rest of his life deal with those injuries and have challenges and I in a way that are seen as old as their videos of him talking about it or anything I mean I haven't seen him talk about it in-depth but we've seen him like his motor skills are coming back he smile and he's able to like speak so it's not like Gerald McClellan know that they changed Roy Jones jr. you know and that he never wanted to turn out like that but then Roy gets older and he still fighting fighting fighting people like deep into his forties like this is crazy like this is the same guy that after gel McClone got hurt said he would never want to go out like that and he's fighting like young badasses in Russia and s*** I don't think you can do it it's hard to stop doing it let's let's take it easy example right into his 50s enough to have some longevity in it without taking that kind of damage like Roy and but he's still there in front of you which is what's the embarrassing part so if your motor skills slow down one of those moments when I was talking to a guy and he said something that was like I thought I should have known until I heard it and I was at all I can't believe I didn't realize that he said it's not the fights that destroy you it's the gym that destroyed it's the sparring oh yeah punishment headgear or not that's what you're seeing at the end of a Fighter's career do you remember it was it Danny Jacobs Jr who was it that someone know something that wasn't him that wasn't Danny Jacobs was someone else someone that said that they stop sparring oh yeah yeah yeah and don't believe that but it was like the 8th round where had Kobe XI deep s*** Jim and his philosophy I remember correctly was yard philosophy was if you don't get hit at all in training you will be so much pressure when you get to the ring so he was doing just ridiculous mitt work and bag work and drills and you're a new had a box so his ID that he will have some fun of his van and he was really fairly green got right in terms of like world-class comport he was doing that for a while he wasn't Spar neurologist doing pad work and just doing wrestling drills and stuff like that kickboxing drills movement to people and also to danger to be able to exist and to be able to fire under pressure you have to keep your eyes open like yeah still because you wouldn't by chance they won't let everybody secret Klitschko knocked out Deontay and training like someone feeling while I was talking about that recently you know but you know you have weaknesses if you're going to lie clean on trying news opening up again to help you work on those days in like catch you if you slip it can I catch you if you slip it but I must say I caught that motherfuking sleeping</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> boxing that has my imagination and my Fascination continually spark is the the finite nature of the tools and weapons that you have to use respect and appreciate MMA but it's different discipline but you're coming from background so I grew up on Kung Fu movies and so when I started they were like the Gracie's break it to me and I understood why a box or whatever fight a karate man or Judo guy whatever because that's what the Sciences for me like these two hands and all of that amazing martial artist can you still believe in like one discipline after all those mma's proven it doesn't work there's no real one discipline that will work best in MMA you have to know everything but if I was going to say what this one's the most important what's a wrestling because if you can't keep a guy from taking you down he's going to be on top of you was going to hold you down going to punch you in the face it's a giant advantage to be able to hold a guy down build upon his face in and you can't really do much when you guys on top of you that sad from there you have to understand you just too cuz if you don't you can hold the guy down then all sudden he wraps his legs around your neck and you caught a triangle when you go to sleep and every fight start standing so you have to have some understanding of striking cuz you have to go to the closest distance but there's no one way to do it that's what's interesting to me is like this Anderson Silva's way to do it was the greatest middleweight of all time and his way to do striking you just stay up with guys and just f*** them up with timing Vision in Muay Thai but then there's guys like Daniel Cormier would take guys down and beat the f*** out of them choke them you know and there's a bunch of different people that with a bunch of different styles in between but if you look at the majority of world champions the majority except maybe a couple weight classes there dominated by wrestlers guys like Daniel Cormier would take guys down and beat the f*** out of him choke them you know and there's a bunch of different people that with a bunch of different styles in between but if you look at the majority of world champions the majority except maybe a couple weight classes there dominated by wrestlers</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> doesn't it to June 2009 that's what I had a Open Mic at the store and I just remember Michael Jackson just died and I just remembered this energy was crazy that night and there was an open mic there's like 16 comics in the main room and I was like 14 and was like No And then they were so we didn't start doing the podcast of the ice house until 2009 how to do it at my house yeah first-year right to it was 2000-2011 that makes sense that's probably when I met you so you but you already rolling by the hell no I have no idea how to make people laugh but I didn't know like what I didn't know the process and so Mitzi was the one who liked past when the last guy she passed at the store and so I just remember being like that when she said you shouldn't say anything she just pointed she looked at Tommy and said make regular he was like like development spots and she's like no he's ready and then I remember being taken away and they were like you've just been passed by Mitzi short like was like a weird like ren-faire wizard Bay I've got to make sure cuz she's never I don't even know when the last time she came to the store was but you never what kind of knew she was ill and I just wanted to be like that I hope this wasn't fixed just her having dementia as being like really know I was lying in bed like I'm a paid regular at the store I was already on TV TV show it to me it meant something to me was like I was up I was a real comic now it's a stamp of approval. Already been paid and not I'm starting to cry doing stand-up like for money you know I've done a lot of headlining gigs you know I travel did some Road gigs and I did a lot of stuff New York before I came to La you know and then I was out here in 94 and she made me first assure maybe a non-paid regular and I would go I've gone last every night and I was here every night so I don't have any friends I'll stand at the Oakwood Garden Apartments as pre furnished apartments and it was on this television show that was terrible and I was just going to the store every night I would work all day doing the thing I didn't have any friends and then I would go to the comic store and that's that's where I feel like tried find a home anyway so I got these late nights at snooze like you know it was always like five people in the audience six people in the audience and then one notch pass me she passed me up for the story before but there's a guy named the Todd and the tated he's eventually he developed like some pretty severe brain issue like and he went insane and it was really sad because back then I had seen him before I ever came out here on MTV on the half-hour Comedy Hour and he sat down next to me while I was on stage and laughed his ass off and then I came offstage and she just goes okay you're passed the audition for the first non-paid regular and I did that for months and then I became a regular but did Todd pulled me aside and he said he goes I sat there and you guys are really funny was what I sat there and I laughed really f****** hard and I told him it to you funny and he goes in your going to do that for other people someday it's a cool feeling it's a cool feeling to I actually had the moment of seeing her I think it was at the it was a reunions it was the 40th reunions something couple years ago and they had me on like the class of 2000's was like Natasha and some other people run the lineup maybe even Duncan I don't know and she was sitting in the back they brought her in in the winter wheelchair and I was like I have to say hi to her you know I never I didn't get to say hi to her and get to meet her the last time she just pointed and took off and I kind of like I went up to her and I looked in her eyes and I shook her hand and I said hi I'm just in the honor to meet you and I just want to say thank you because you changed my life and she just stared at me and I was like she doesn't even know and then all of a sudden she just squeeze my hand and I was at that's all I needed so that that to me was like she's there she gets it yeah you know she'd have those moments should be in and out but that's everything that I've done that's the light up to where I'm at now has been for her too because I haven't had other than my other than my mom and my friends back home I've never had somebody really believe in me like that you know what I mean yeah we're getting out of that like I'm not good enough and I'm moving home it's like oh wow I actually have a home now and every time I go there now I just feel so welcome and you know it's it's it's nice it's a fraternity it's a sorority it's a Buena versity I'm not good enough and I'm moving home it's like oh wow I actually have a home now and every time I go there now I just feel so welcome and you know it's it's it's nice it's a fraternity it's a sorority it's a Buena versity</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> YouTube video with I don't know what it came out it's Adam Carolla sat down with Tucker Carlson did you see that where they talk about we talked about like California they talk about the homeless epidemic that's here in California and how I've been trying what kind of looks a blind eye because we are a city and a state that lives on permits and parking and licenses and you know we just want that money you know so it's like if you force Memorial Forest Lawn Memorial like how you look across the way there's all these you know immigrants and what not like selling flowers you know but like a woman driving without a license but she'll get pulled over and charged but all these other it was kind of interesting I hate saying I hate being like an interesting interview that's probably good point a couple years ago cuz you know it went from downtown and then downtown pushes them all out so they keep going west keep going west some go to the beach I'm going to Santa Monica but now it's like I live in an area that you know six seven years ago it was it was fine but now it's like even on the way to go get coffee this morning I walk everywhere I go it's like I saw like three three homeless people just outside just screaming at nothing you know they're in tattered clothes and they're dirty and you know I went I used to work the girl years ago at a restaurant when I waited tables and she's now homeless and she's like out of her mind and I feel bad when she always nevermind no no she you know she did yoga and now what happened I don't know I don't know if I did the progression of illness yes so we Bounce from job to job because one day we go to work in the be changed on the door cuz they couldn't pay us so we had this little kind of group that we would go apply together at different jobs and then I started seeing her out on the street and just walking around ether missing and running down the street crying and it just breaks my heart cuz it's like I don't know what to do and I don't know if she would be willing or how tight where you were there other phone number one night and walking outside and you know how everyone they just keep everyone outside like you do and she just like Barrel through everybody just screaming nonsense and like s*** like teeth missing and it's just sad it's just really really sad and then I'm at the gym working out I'll see her like down there but you know with her garbage and everything and she doesn't it's just that it's so long cause when you knew her she didn't seem like she had a mental health issues really now I mean she would talk she would do yoga I mean I remember her always Lotus hurt with her name was Lotus Harmony which animal has a real name but at the time that's how I know sweet lady you know just beautiful skin beautiful smile always in a good mood when she got mad you were like oh man do you know cuz she was always so friendly and yeah and then now you're just like damn and I just want I don't know what to do I would love to help her because it just breaks my heart homeless people break my heart but female homelessness really really is sad for me yeah it's it's I think most of what you're seeing with homeless people is people that are severely mentally ill so you got a Wonder like what cause maybe she was on medication and her dad her you know her insurance ran out in full on Joker yeah it's like you. We dated for a long-ass time it's like if he didn't have his his anti-anxiety ya like and he got off that I mean he would full-on have a panic attack and that would get dirty and I had to witness that which was insane people that lose it because of their author medication yeah that's a sad situation because you like you're always going to be Tethered to this thing to go to work if I don't use it twice today I just hope it works Heather Tuesday #Taylor Tuesday it's like what happens to them it's the f****** coronavirus hits and they get locked doors for 6 months and you just become agoraphobic and lose your s*** while we were talking about this the other day that most of what this is all happening from the Reagan Administration during the Reagan Administration they change the standards of what it means to be mentally ill and they just released people from asylums they didn't want to pay for it all you don't. Look if La is a city of 20 + million people which is as many people in La as I think is in all of Australia so think about that thing about the amount of money and that they can't make a silence here thinking about how many abandoned buildings there are through how much money how much money would it cost to is there currently someone in the neighborhood of 70000 homeless people that they said there was some Mystic that said there's more empty apartments in this town then homeless people the thing is though those folks don't just need a place cuz they'll f*** that play a bag of Rehabilitation and they need counseling and they need me and some people I don't I mean I'm not a mental health expert some of them you might not be able to do anything too gone. there are you a bunch of guys that were homeless back for my pool hall days was a bunch of guys who would hang around the pool hall they would even sleep on the floor and the you know I knew guys to try to sleep in people's couches asleep at the bus stops and then they'll come to the pool and try to hustle up enough money to get some drugs and out it was they were stuck in this place where they could never get past where they were they were just in a rut and they can never get out of it and it's heartbreaking bear cuz you're just like what happened since the other day I'm walking down Santa Monica Boulevard over by Barney's Beanery and I just hear up and I look over in this kids like had to be 22 23 years old and I was like what happened where are your parents drop them in the South are RAM and ravan I'll show you Hollywood Reporter people do that you meet in this town will you meet him early in their journey and they still have hope like it's not worked out yet but it's going to I'm going to make it and then you run into him Comics you're so I mean that's the thing I think this so relatable field as well cuz people what time I mean give me a time where it was 2002 and then 2005 and then meet you until when 2007 and want to say yeah I think I met you at the ice house when we were podcasting out there yeah and then when you came back to the store 1414 what I saw you again and even then it was like making working memory looked when you go through the weirdest gay guy I've ever met and I was like f*** yeah what I say that I don't know probably or what's my other option move home or suicide well it's also you see so many people that are doing well right like it seems so far Out Of Reach like when you're broke and you see some guy driving by in a Mercedes convertible and I only sees people going with those big high-rises off of La Cienega come in there and everything but no one lives there maybe like what I've heard is that the they build those and then the Saudis want their kids to come to school here and get American education so they just buy them for but nobody I've overheard something I mean there's maybe like what I've heard is that the they build those and then the Saudis want their kids to come to school here and get American education so they just buy them for but nobody I've overheard something</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> no towards the end of my career like I just didn't I didn't finish the way I wanted to let you know when I felt like you know after I came back from my injuries I just wasn't the same for a fighter anymore I just for you not the same physically or was it mentally it was physical but it also it became mental because it was because physically I just didn't feel the same you know I didn't feel like I ever regain the power back in in my legs and for the most part my lights were everything you know the injuries I had two ACL surgeries on my right knee and that completely just it it changed everything for me because you know being a smaller light-heavyweight all of my power was all in my legs you know it whatever I couldn't make up for in the size Department of top I was usually able to make up for with the part of my leg so you know is that related to the injury that you got when you were a Jackson's and Diego Sanchez crash into you know that was so that was a different injury so that was a MCL but it wasn't my left knee so the right knee was hurting. cuz I'm like why the f*** is a guy training for a world title fight in a regular class will where everybody knows people Collide in the people of regular classes all time with millions of dollars on the line and I know that all the time has happened but when you start to move up and there's more on the line that you always have to take every single precaution because you can't afford to take a step back and for me once I have my knee injuries though I just mentally was not the same person and when I competed I wasn't the same person and then it affect me because then I'm like you know I'm not the same person did you lose the ability to explode with your knees did you have meniscus damage as well I have meniscus damage I lost it exploding I lost it will get tired my leg I get tired you know and it wouldn't have the same valence the same Rhythm and it kind of felt kind of felt heavy and I couldn't really feel it in the front you know the front part of my knees I couldn't really feel it I had a little did you have a patellar tendon graft out of intelligent replace your ACL with that correct yeah give me more than a year before it felt right and then even then if I was on my knees it would hurt like hell to see nothing like I still to this day I still have dead spots where I can't feel in my knee and I think I had to do it a lot because I had two of the new series back-to-back like when I was only for my first one then it ruptured again so then I had to go back in and get it done you know what the first time it was with the cadaver and then the cadaver tissue didn't take but it did I know that like almost a year later and then it slipped out just trying to normally f*** yes I see how the brutal and do it you know still because when you mess up your knee you know for me it's just kind of mentally just it messed me up with that how much physical rehab did you have to do for that Year's worth of it just you know the first I didn't do it as well as I could have because I'm a guy you know I bought my pretty easy and I did like I felt like I was bouncing back pretty easy but when it went to second time then it was harder because not only was I healing from the ACL but then mine Eagles healing in general just from you know the previous surgery and then plus this surgery and then I had something different because of the first surgery it wasn't it wasn't too invasive. I wasn't using my own my own tissue is easy if it works if your body takes it how long does it take for a broke blew out again and I was almost a year I was training for another fight thinking I can get back in shape and fight again and then when I was training for that fight it blew out again y'all Scout schedule to fight augustinsson and then AJ end up taking it fight instead but it was it was it was one that that just you know it was like first when I was out for two years while healing from injury like to went when all the camera stop flashing when people stop caring to get your pictures when you know that whole feeling the whole feeling that just that happens when you met that when you when you hit that transitional point and stop becoming that guy and it was difficult transition at first because you know even though I always told myself I would never you know put myself in the mindset of being just that fighter sooner or later become just that fighter and and that's what happened to me so when I to me that you weren't the best what not not just the bad one elite elite world-class fighter like I used to be on that level anymore at that that was something for me that was like God damn you know you use of your legs are so pivotal so huge for you like we're not in that Rampage fight I remember that opening sequence when you just started after blasting of the right-hand it was so fast on him and he cracked him quick and no but that is some serious explosion and that and that was even in that fight I could even wrestle like last for weeks at a fight because I had to I pulled my hamstring in a fight so I was just really just drilling up until that fight for the last 4 weeks so and then when I came out like that I was like I was a little insecure and I'll let you know what I'm just going to see what happen if I go and it works just like okay I still got some spring yeah so yeah so when I when I was into my career and just kind of getting you know, trying to figure out like what what's next for me you know it was hard you know it was just a hard place because I really have anybody to talk to you I don't really know what I was going to do next in my life you know and then when I started fighting again I still was in that place where I just wasn't you know totally back to fighting my mentality because fighting is it pigmentally that it takes it takes a certain mentality for you no end in for me fighting with something that I did to exercise some demons a bit you know but but having some time away from the sport it allow me to figure out other ways to exercise soejima demons in you know figure out some things around if you know the things that made me mad at things that were my fuel before I kind of made peace with them and it making peace with a lot of things that I if my fuel it just change the way I fought in the way I seen fighting so coming back to fight I just wasn't that same fighter anymore and then when I got to the point where I was like man I can't keep myself like I was like man I'm not fighting the way I want to fight and you know there's I mean what's the point if I can't go and compete the way I want to I'm only towards myself so then I decided to retire but then when I retired I was still was in that space where I like mayonnaise still something missing so then when I did the 5 Meo DMT that kind of put things in perspective in a in a whole different way you know and it and it just it it change me it changed me a lot to change the way that you like I said the way I think the way I eat everything everything about it you know so it was it was so cathartic until medicine is so many sense of the word you know you think that something like that would be really beneficial for Fighters that are in the Twilight of their career I think I think it could be I think I think every fighter gets to a point where you fight enough then fighting it kind of It kind of you kind of getting a weird space about and you know I seen Fighters go through that. Where they just kind of like figuring out that why am I still doing this you know they've had Great Moments Inside the Cage but then they have those down moments and those down moments are the moments where it's harder to come back from and I think those are the times where you you know a psychedelic or something that could put things in perspective and in a lot of fire to see the why behind the reason they're doing it and maybe create a new why you're so different is funny you know I've noticed that about you over the last 2 years or just I don't get to see you that often when I get to see you over the last few years ago I promised something has changed and Rashad like you or your more I mean I hate to use the word spiritual but you seem like a more spiritual more peaceful God I noticed that so and Rashad like you or you're more I mean I hate to use the word spiritual but you seem like a more spiritual more peaceful God I noticed that so that's why I was really interested to have this conversation see what your journey was yeah it has been it's been one hell of a journeyman</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> my friend since when when when Jon Jones was first competing Jon Jones He competed so freely because you know it was just like he was it was just in his nature like he was just so creative and fart different because of you know he fought from that place of just creativity that ignorance that that that ignorant blessed you know he couldn't be beat he didn't believe it can be beat and you know he will fight that way and he would do some genius stuff cuz of that you know but then when you have those experiences where you you know you've been caught in a fight or you you know you made some mistakes in there then you do know better but then those those those thoughts it actually slows you down a bit too because you're not fully react and you're you're thinking of a hair before it was just kind of like a reaction his opening fight the opening sequence of his fight with Shogun mean he's 23 years old he's fighting for the world title and he opens up flying me the f*** does that that that was that was that that was that dumb and young for so long a whole fighting style just that you know letting it all hang out let me fly and that's what worries me that's why I thought in his fight with Dominick Reyes it was going to be a closer fight because of the fact that Dominick Reyes now have would John used to have been in that Blissful ignorance you didn't really know how much you know how better John wasn't even care he was just kind of like I can let you know himself almost in it but it worked out for him you know well what's interesting about that fight is first of all to Great argument for 5 round championship fights because for the first three rounds Dominick Reyes is winning the question is whether he won the third round that's the one I believe it's up for grabs most people that I've talked to thank John won the last two clearly most people most people that are talked to that are experts most people Feud disagree believe the Dominick Reyes won the first three and the third round was the one that seems to be well dumbass scored more but it was close enough we could see someone giving it to John particular since John was pressing the action John was pushing forward maybe you give John but they thought but they said if there's a disputable around it is that third-round yes I agree judge gave John four rounds to one that's insane this is the same judge that when I believe Luke Thomas was talking about this I'm sorry if I'm wrong cuz I'm not saying the judges name because I'm not sure if I'm correct but I believe it's the same judge that Trevin Giles who fought James Krause Wanda winning the decision but the first round crowds had his back for 4 minutes and the referee the judge gave that round to Giles which is insane I mean for 4 minutes cross had his back was it the guy was fighting off chokes Krauss was real close to submitting them couple times during those four minutes and the judge the same judge who gave four rounds to Jon Jones gave that first-round to Giles the dude on his back before f****** minutes around and maybe even a f****** more egregious fight was Andre Ewell versus Jonathan Martinez that fight was f****** crazy that fight was crazy that was the most crazy one Martinez won that fight Martinez won that fight you will broke his arm I think I'm not sure was a broken arm and head are injury to his right hand early in the fight somewhere in between either the first or the second round. She'll be really couldn't throw right hand and it was kind of hanging you because he was hanging and Martinez put in work it was an amazing performance by him and he got f***** over man real bad it was bad decision-making there was a bunch of bad fight there was a bunch of bad decision wasn't just one it was like four or five on a card of what 12 fights 11.5 I forget how many was from the opening prelims it was bad decisions just almost like people who don't know what they're saying yeah especially when we reach the point that we have and mixed martial arts you know I think that we we we turn the corner that mean the fact that there's there's so many so much out there so much knowledge out there in this poor and everything else out then if you going to be judging that you got at least know when somebody is is winning around I mean you know that there's aspects of of Giants game that that was you know score some points always moving forward with the actions but you know even when he was born for the action he wasn't terribly to offense if you will come with his legs but you know a lot of times he would allow he would have Dominic to kind of be the first one initiating then moving off and it sometimes it seemed like he was just kind of chasing them but you know I think that it was it was that there around that third round was that that hard wrong to score but you know it I I I think that Dom had the edge but if you going to be the champion you got to be the champion I don't think he did that Jon Jones impressed me so much with the shot that he was able to take more or less the mindset that John had that that that mindset that John had in those Championship rounds to me that that showed that this guy is you know he is a total package and and when it comes to fight and just mentally speak and you know he's he's my wife thought that was frustrated and working through his own frustrating in the fight for his frustration fight it is difficult to come to his own frustration and and he just kept at pressure going took some big shots from heavy hitter but Dominick Reyes is a problem for anybody has a problem is a real problem especially now that I got that rub he touched touch greatness with John in the greatest ever I feel like those last two rounds should count more personal opinion but John Kavanagh said something on the Twitter page I believe is John Kavanagh and it reflects exactly how I feel that if this fight was going to go on another five rounds it's pretty f****** clear to me who's going to win who's going to the death Jon Jones going to win that fight you know if it's to the death there's no doubt about it in my mind that Jon Jones eventually going to get him those last two rounds Dominick Reyes was hurting you could see him looking at and taking big deep breaths and trying to move and his arms with labored and John just kept cameras and kept kept kept trying for the takedown in that should mean more it should mean more towards the end of the fight at the end of the fight if you win a decision but you didn't you just got your ass kicked for the last 4 minutes that seems crazy to me that you won the fight because I mean I know this is a dumb way to think about it but if we were in a schoolyard right we're in high school and some dude and another dude fought the dude was getting the s*** beat out of them at the end of the fight is the guy who lost teachers come and they pull you off that guy that's who won 121 and I know that you can't score of the national sport the way you look but it is the rarest of rare professional sports because it's the sport of fighting and infighting when you're getting your ass kicked you were you know you're supposed to supposed to lose if you're getting your ass kicked you lost in the guy's ass you went sounds crazy but at the end of Jon Jones is that he was he was chasing him down. It was takes a big deep breath he was firing back when he fired back very well in the fourth round but John absorption has a f****** hell of a chin to halibut you know much of a chance I mean you can't he's he's something special because of everything it's not see something special because of his physical attributes he's very tall and long is very strong it's not just his skills that great wrestling he's got great striking it is all in his mind yeah it's all those things he it's his ability to press forward its ability to break people Billy stay on top of you have that Champion's mindset and to know that he's fought the majority of his career as a world champion which is f****** crazy I mean almost a decade as the greatest in the world chasing everybody that he's fought every single fighter that he's bought you look at them they're all what guys like you guys like Machida world champions Rampage world champions over and over and over again you go through the list of them just all these killers is Just Killer after killer Gustafson you know I mean you just keep going through his entire career DC twice stop them in the second fight he's a f****** assassin to be able to go through everything that he's going through you know the ups and downs yet what that what that does to your mind yes you know what that does to your mind and and just being able to put that to a side or be able to use it in order to go out and still perform as if like he hasn't missed a beat that is hard because it gets to the point you know you get you get anything about if you get tired of it you get you get Jaded by it hasn't been quiet and he still goes out there and perform play that I think he needed someone like Dominic to get that fear going to I think he knew Dominick Reyes physically is a talented guy he's a great athlete he has tremendous footwork his ability to change angles and fire back is insane so good you saw in the OSP fight were knocked them out with like a couple seconds ago you see it a lot of Jared cannonier fight tickets step back and Fire by uppercut step back bar that straight left his ability to change direction is amazing and I think a lot of that could be attributed to his football basketball I mean baseball like footwork movement his ability to explode all that stuff that he did in other sports I think directly translates to his ability to move really well inside the octagon and then on top of his gigantic is the same size as John which is very unusual for John to face someone that's his height and he's really f****** strong to acid that was known that was the intent but I think that John didn't expect he didn't expect for him to be as strong as he was when he wasn't even on his legs are f****** huge could raise his legs mean he's got tremendous power me both with his punches but also with his ability to move Matt he was throwing great kicks he was chopping a John's legs I mean can you fight in John's future I want to see a rematch I really want to see what my grass looks like now with this rub understanding how close he was and then the amount of conditioning that he's going to have to put himself through to be able to do that again five rounds and it's not like either guy got f***** up in that fight was going to be severely damaged it's not like one of those crazy Wars where they like adesanya Kelvin Gastelum at the end of that fight was like oh my God and I hope Calvin take some time off difficult hard fight but it wasn't a fight where there was so much damage that both John and and adamic need to take a long time off I feel like you can make that fight at 8 months after that lie and that would be a fight to make that is a that's a crazy rematch like their faces weren't beat up at yeah he he took he took those shots well man it is it's amazing it's amazing but I think that this is exactly what John needed in that light heavyweight weight class because you know it it does it was getting kind of stagnant and I think it needed some time to mature but I think I think Dominic razor say you better stay here for a little bit and there's another guy Corey Anderson he's angry he's angry and that's something you never seen Corey letting everybody know you f****** been slipping you been sleeping on me you guys have been pretending that I don't exist out here beating the best in the world if he fights gallon and you know he was so angry after he won and knocked him out in the first round and then he's back the years of disrespect</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> then you also have this crazy green drink that you were telling me about this right here is spirulina ever since I changed my diet up I need to have a couple of these every single day and it makes me feel good my life medispend it's been one of things I can honestly say that's just revolutionize my my complete everything is still it's it's it's been everything that that lately that has you know changed me from a mental standpoint physical standpoint and even spiritual standpoint because it does all meat diet that I've been on that changes your mind the other way it makes you more aggressive keep the demons at bay but it is it's that it's also like if you think about it with you if your body thinks okay I have to eat animals all the time cuz all this m*********** eats his animals right your body thinks that your body is going to sort of take on the characteristics of something that's a predator right you would become more I mean this is obviously like some b******* bro psychology cuz I'm a moron but I would say your body is going to think I'm if I have to chase you down and kill it that's that's you used to be more predatory do you but your body has to think that way I can get with that makes sense though it makes sense did you do it right after you retired you know I kind of not right after I retired it was kind of something at that kind of just happened like I ever since I like I do mushrooms right cheap trip that just cause me to have one of those Eagle deaths and when I had the eagle death I was like an estate where does knowing this is coming to me and it was like you know I was like it was all day of mushroom ceremony and it was all day and I was just out in the sun and just you know in my own mind and then I'll smelling real bad and then I smell myself annoying to said like you stink because you eat dead Rotting Flesh and it said if you want to eat if you want life than you eat life that's what does knowing that said to me and then either that's a strange thought to just come into my mind like that and then after that no kidding like I just lost my taste for me it just and I used to eat all kinds of meat out eat I would eat pork in an hour so you know big into pork and bacon to like all kinds of meat and I was never one of those hi guys at all but after that happened to me after I had to experience it was just like one of those things that that I just couldn't help but go into like I just lost the taste for me one trip yeah I mean well it was what it was kind of started when I like about 8 months before that I did the toad and then a toad was one that that really was the Catalyst for everything can you did the toad 5 Meo DMT we have the toad and the toad was one that was I guess the the Catalyst of busing at gate open and it's a crazy but the Meo DMT was the first one where I just ceased to exist I just stopped and it made me really aware of ego really aware but even the way I express myself the way I would frame sentences and say things I was just trying to sound cool yet I was trying to portray something in a way of not just trying to portray the information but trying to impress people and it made me like feel real gross yeah well that's that's the thing bother you a mammal experience it was a man I just never I never thought that Consciousness could be so fast and so big you know when I when you when you have that experience with the 5-meo it just like it made this Consciousness make look as if like it was a drop in the bucket you know just like a little drop and I got to experience the ocean of consciousness that right there was it was the most humbling experience I've ever had you know just to feel my ego who I thought I was what I thought it was completely just annihilated in to feel what I actually was you know it was it was crazy I feel like regular Consciousness that most of us exist in most of the time is a veneer it's a very thin veneer and through some things you get a taste of what some of the surface through meditation and yoga and all these methods that people use holotropic breathing you get a taste of what's underneath the surface Kundalini Yoga apparently the Kundalini Yoga para I've never really done it but some people say you could really trip out if you do it in a certain way for long periods of time people have like very intense psychedelic experience as I can to DMT yeah I had like a like a Kundalini and kind of experience like a note Awakening where it was like a just had felt like the top of my head just completely was gone and it was it was like I was just open to all like the information it was it was a crazy it was like I had no no no no had like it was just I was just information was just pouring into the roof the roof was this from Kundalini but I felt but I felt that that that Kundalini experience where you see the light and it's like those really intense light that that happens in in my head and it was just go home you see you see the universe you know that thing about the center of your head that's what the there's just a lot of speculation and what the Egyptians were trying to draw when they were drawing certain images but there's certain temples that seem to mimic certain certain shapes and examples of seem to mimic the pineal gland like even the eye that there's that famous Egyptian eye that has that's where they dip down and that weird sort of Egyptian shape that there's been a bunch of different Scholars that have tried to figure out what exactly that man in more than one of the theories is it at the cross section of the pineal gland and they think they're what they were emphasizing was that that is the area where the brain produces all the Psychedelic chemicals they speculated this for a long time but Rick Strassman he's a guy that wrote that book DMT The Spirit Molecule and was actually a documentary on it that I always stood and he he's done a bunch of work with this Cottonwood Research Foundation where they've shown now that it exists in live rats and that it did it is actually produced by that gland that DMT is actually produced in these animals by this one particular gland that they assumed associated with Spiritual Awakening 1/3 I actually a real thing feeling that you get and the thing about mushrooms it's really interesting as mushrooms actually mimic natural human neurochemistry there's 5 Meo DMT there's NN DMT and then what mushrooms with process to the way the way of your body process to become something called for Fox for aloxxi n n dimethyltryptamine so it's really is a real close cause I might have butchered that technical description but that's it it's real close to human neurochemistry to your body absorbs it very easily your body takes in anybody knows what it is nobody knows to do with it see when I was I like mushrooms because of mushroom so the 5 Meo so powerful that you you can't really get a handle on what happened like I came back from being away for like 17 minutes I'm just like oh that was intense you know I felt as if like I was everything all at the same time and it was so many different things that was just funny but you really can't unpack it because it's it's it's incomprehensible to an extent for the for the largest that because you're you're you're dealing with you know what concepts that the human mind can't even grasp because there's no vocabulary to to speak about it you know so when I did the mushrooms and mushrooms were kind of like the rivers and the lakes that leads to the ocean and it helps me understand how I am part of something so big and something so so when I when I did to my mom's going to have a mushroom experiences they were all different and some and some respect you know like all like whatever I do go deep cuz I like to go deep I don't I don't I don't play around when I go do something but I like to get in there were like 5 grams make 10 are those big ones the big doses where you you get kind of scared what she ate it like whole boy has helped me out so much</div>

Yeah I bet it goes this way first yes I can put you guys like that he's a great man Improvement the current state of MMA gloves are better than the original ones that they had a few years back you know the improved maybe eight or nine years ago but still those are better what's the I mean in the NFL and that's where we got radonich you know we just want to be able to get a product out there for the athletes in that they can they can use but it protects him because a lot of lot of that the injuries like 75% of my happen in training swore you know and if we can kind of cut that number down then they can have a lot more these Fighters making these dates and for the most part for the spiders you can actually you know if you can have gear that protects you and you don't we can kind of cut that number down the neck and have a lot of more of these spiders making these dates and for the most part for these Fighters you can actually you know if you can have gear that protects you and you don't got to suffer these long injuries like his ACL</div>

That was driving me crazy new real disrespectful to Fighters real dismissive a Fighters so going to the fight I felt that disrespect and I was like you know what man all right I don't care what happens I'm like this I got I got a leash at least give a good showing for myself you know and that's and that's all I really cared about doing you know I went out I walked out to the song Immortal Technique is called that's my boy I love him really solidified everything I was feeling at that moment you know like like it you know there's a verse in there and says you know the place that I'm from doesn't exist anymore and I knew after I walked out to that fight you no life and never be the same brother I want a loss so that was the big moment that was the big mama there was no doubt I was not going to be the same Rashad after that fight no matter what happened Immortal Technique that such great lyrics he's so smart so smart dude I'm so politically aware that you're politically aware he's got so much depth to his lyrics I love that dude keep putting it back he's he's like one of the guys you listen to and you just kind of keep putting it back</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you were a big part of the blackzilians getting started yet and when you have that opportunity as a guy was a former world champion to go there and sort of get become a part of a team from the ground up what did you try to do that was different then had you would singing in other camps that you have participated in I wanted to make it just like a you know the biggest thing back then it was it was that there was you always had what is so many different place in order to use get that one thing so I wore the really wanted to just make it so that our guys didn't have a need to go anywhere else for anything else and that was the whole idea behind the whole black things you know we brought in all kinds of people from every different aspect from you know training 222 nutrition almost every aspect of it and that's what we wanted to provide our athletes were just like the total the total game so they really didn't have to do anything worry about anything except for stop the train and it worked for a while it worked for a while but but it's it's a hard thing to maintain because that's in the very very expensive thing for Glenn the guy who put up the cash I mean I had heard some outlandish figures that he had was in the hole for that place for by the time and everything was up and running yeah yeah it was it was a pretty pretty pretty happy ticket man as a pretty happy take it and it was was it was an expense that it did get out of hand it take it out and even his situation so he got himself in a situation where he was doing so much for people just became a thing that people expect it out of him and then when he wasn't able to do any more than it was kind of like you know people are like a badass guy isn't Destiny wasn't that but he just he just wanted to do so much and had an idea to want to do do do things on another level but at the same time you know the the finances of of doing it was a massive undertaking I'm sure I mean all credit to Dan Lambert cuz Dan Lambert that's not even doing this from the beginning that f****** guy mean he is the reason why these super camps got started and lamb to put his own money and then the new ATT they built he built himself from the ground up built the whole f****** building and you know I haven't seen in person at friends have gone to visit but I've seen it in videos it's wholly this is phenomenal I went inside of it and the man with the blackzilians you know him and I got a chance to spend some time together and just hello to a meeting so crazy and I just inherited this beef and I like you know it is silly and especially the fact the eighties like literally right down the street from my house it would be closer to go there than anywhere else but it was weird for a while but actually talking to Dan and actually getting to know him and you know it was it was a good it was a good thing because you know I got I got to get a lot of respect for for him and just for what he's done with American top team in 18 General he's a brilliant guy I love that guy as a person I'm a big fan of his I just love that a person like that like Dan Lambert can literally change the course of mme by setting an example and by having a gym that sets an example that such a insanely high level so big so many world-class Fighters there somewhat strength-and-conditioning Everything Under One Roof dorms everything I think that was that was a thing that that kind of position for Glenn you know Brett young keep up he had to keep up while he was trying to outdo cuz I trying to do Dan Lambert always want to do something at Dan wasn't doing you no good luck with that Albuquerque AKA you know what's up when you first started there was not that many places now that really wasn't in into even get what we wanted out of it you know where there's three gyms that we can go through will go to either Jackson's in Albuquerque will go to TriStar and Montreal or we'll go to Denver and we'll work with Trevor Wittman in Denver so we have the three camps that we bounced around from in and that's what we are going to get the most working and it work for awhile you nowhere for a while for the most part but just all that traveling you just became hard to do but it has to wear on you when you're in the middle of a camp and your yeah I didn't hotels and yeah it does like a champ I really wouldn't travel too much but like when so what we'll do is that if it Nate Marquardt was in Camp and he wanted to stay at home most of the time so we'll stagger it where you don't need to have a tough guy and kept every single time so I'll be a couple weeks when George wasn't there or when Keith wasn't there you know and this where you know you have a tough guy and kept every single time so I'll be a couple weeks when George wasn't there or when Keith wasn't there you know and then sometimes we all come together but for the most part we just all rotate into these gyms depending on who was fighting who need to work</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> do you put one The Ultimate Fighter is a heavyweight which is so crazy I know can I look at me now I'm like I didn't expect it I didn't expect to feel this good I didn't think that a diet make me feel this good what is what is particularly makes you feel so good in what way my energy I have an energy level that it's really hard to to say kind of feels a bit Supernatural in a bit you know like I feel I feel energy like I feel I feel like my body's energy feels like it's kind of hard to say it's kind of hard to say is kind of hard to describe without looking crazy we buy phones vegan diet I'm I'm seeing all these supplements you taking spirulina and like everything you obviously doing it right which is you know there's a lot of people that they're there vegan but they're even like pasta and pizza and it like that it is not the not doing it correctly in terms of taking the proper amount of nutrients right and that's and that's the thing about it like I I I read this book the mucusless diet and it's by a doctor Arnold ehret and this is like in the early he came up this book and he had some stomach issues and it was you no not until he was fed up and was on like you know what I'm like you starving himself and then he realize he had some really you know it kind of changes is his stomach situation so then he started looking into diet and nutrition and then he he became a fruitarian and this book is talking about pretty much you know the role of food in your body and in what it does and what causes mucus and what doesn't cause mucus and you know through understanding the mucus that died in just the reading it it just gave me a different hold understanding like a different understanding of the of why I'm doing this you know in any game it became to me deeper than just like oh I can't have this because you know the diet selection have it it says I can't have it because you know this going to cause inflammation in I know the deeper reason of why easier for me to avoid the Pitbull the bad food you know there's also a situation with people where there's everyone that there's a biological variability where some people some diets to sync up well for them like I know I know a lot of people that they don't feel good when they eat red meat when they eat fish they feel great now light Foods you know they're their body whatever forever is their digestion favors certain type of diet I don't I don't know if this will work for everybody probably won't work right at me the most likely won't work for everybody but for me it was it was something that my body just was like it's about time you started to start to treat us the right way you know in a crazy part about it is a fact that now I train less but I can't rain hard like now I can do sparring sessions wear like a spark like an hour straight and I'm sparring at a pretty good pace I'm not like when it's it's smartbar like we're not like bashing each other in the head and she liked that we just went weird being smart about it you know we're doing you know a little bit lighter to the head but more more happy shots to the body you know making those ones count and just kind of like touching you know giving it a nice shot today but not like I'ma knock you out what type of foods are you eating like how are you what is it a give me a typical meal for typically speaking it all depends on the time of the day but the but I don't eat no more in a fast up until noon or until like 1 and then my first are you on like a 16-hour 14-hour like intermittent fasting 16/8 intermittent fast and then I eat I usually like like I'll come home and you know maybe like a hearty hearty shake that I make a fruit and then I'll put some you know something mushrooms and stuff in it just like in the Court decides the the lion's mane and you know from this brand life cycle sure you do your hair so that brand right there makes you do really good teacher that you just drop it in there and you ain't got to worry about changing the flavor of too much of of your shakes are drop that in there with my shakes and stuff like that and I usually take that loving my first meal and then the second one to be a little bit more hearty it'll be something with pitbulls and maybe some potatoes or something so it's a little bit more hearty and then I'll have another hearty meal like a vegetable type meal vegetable based meal at night time and then then I'll usually be done for the day are you using any protein powders pea protein hemp protein as long as long as I don't I don't use any choice vegetables Raw Bar for like I feel like my muscle mass is pretty good like I don't feel like I'm I'm too skinny or like I don't I'm not gain any more stuff like I can gain muscle and you know it is it's just been working for me and it's basically just eat to feel good like however it makes you feel good yeah right and you got it down now you know like what kind of foods it's the supplement thing gets strange vegan so you know there's a lot of folks that they're mixing a lot of different dietary beasts in a lot of different powders and different things and blending these different things and it's some people don't like the way that feels when you're eating like that but yeah I was like what you're eating is much more Whole Food baby has whole food-based like a lot of the food that I became actually good cook now because of the fact that I had to learn to cook my own food my wife she is busy becoming you know busy on her own doing her own thing so she wasn't able to cook me like she was before but then I I learned myself and through learning myself it just completely just like took the shackles off of off of me getting a really good menu like a lot of chickpeas and things of that nature like really interesting weird cooking out vegetable dishes everything's vegetarian and I guess it's with them it's a religious thing a lot of lot of Indians already have vegetarian like I just have energy to just go and go and go get lights out cycle tincture somebody gave me some of that I should have bring it but it has like like has reishi and has turkey tail lion's mane cordyceps and and it even gives you you know a schedule on one when you should take it in when it when is best but it is a really really good good mushrooms because you know that they had they put they Infuse there's with this is kakadu plum so kakadu Plum you're here that one of the most high high in vitamin C fruits there there is like his way higher than vitamin C than oranges and everything else like that and they cost to plumb yeah kakadu that sounds like something that a little kid with a really really good supplement and I don't really like to recommend something that's too much but that's one that I taken I might man I feel I feel way better off doing a lot of Beats I do I do what is is crazy like just eating greens like I've been eating grains I just don't feel like I don't get tired like I used to like my body's just instantly recovering what was your old diet like what would what was it like when your training for a fight with typical meals be like really good when I eat red meat like I felt as if like when I eat red meat it almost felt like I can feel it like within like the next 20-30 Min like at my body bring down really fast you know so I felt I felt good eating it but I didn't feel like I had the like the endurance I got I didn't feel the endurance aspect like I do right now you know so that that's been like the best I ever felt was when I fought Tito Ortiz I was eating as eating red meat but I also was coupling that up with a lot of spinach how's it going to spend it like I will go and give up rdr2 get a big bag of Spanish yet that's exactly what I was doing I'll get a big bag of spinach and I was put in the blender and just grind it up and then throw like some apples in it to make a little bit sweeter to change in taste so I won't be so so greenest like grass and then I'll just drink those all the time but it just made me feel so strong interesting interesting now did you used to work with the nutritionist all I did because when you were cutting weight like how many fights did you have at 80522 big enough to be a small enough to be a middleweight either like and feel like I can you know like so I was like in that weird weird space or when I cut down to 185 I felt like it felt threatened drain I just didn't have the the movie pop you know but then at 2:05 I kind of felt Underside you now back then what did you walk around that back then I was walking around around like to 25 to 30 and what was different because it was for meeting to meet me at from me I made from eating me out I will get that 20-plus pounds that your body doesn't have to pump blood through. nothing too like I would you know this is another reason why I like cuz when I wasn't fighting that was the problem because I would get into these bad eating habits because I would always know that would have had training camp I can just cut the weight and just lose it like that but after a while it becomes your having anything to do overtime that becomes your habit becomes a lifestyle and I was eating a lot of sugar I need to make a change for my life for the rest of my life you know right and that's why this whole lifestyle fit so much better than you know if you think that would have changed your career had you eaten this way back when you're competing I think so I think it would have but at the same time I don't know and which way you need to chill yeah yeah this way back when you're competing I think so I think it would have but at the same time I don't know and which way you know the saying I'm a lie to chill yeah yeah</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> radio show sweet tell you they want you to bring up certain subjects we have jokes you know there's not even that long ago man like less than 10 years ago I did one of those National radio shows in the Midwest and asked me do that and I was like what and the producer got upset and I go I don't do that I'm not going to do that and like we need subjects like the guy was like pissy with me weather fake laughing and enjoying this used to be though WOOD Radio used to be like you'd go on WAAF and Boston and do you know you would talk to the guys and you would kind of working your bits you know in like everybody did it everybody did their bits yeah I guess it was a part of it but I was never good at it well cuz your authentic but Opie and Anthony was the first to meet Lee Howard show was much more control do you know how it's behind the mixer he's kind of controlling ever there's a certain amount of times he would talk to you and then other people come in and then you know he had like a bum or more of a structure where is Owen a you would go in there and Anthony would have a gun and f****** you know Opie's behind the mixer just was her watching all this chaos go on different, come filtering in and you know everytime marionberry walked in yeah he was going on sway next door any kind of walked in like he had no idea who we were was really uncomfortable I knew he was going to leave soon so I immediately started asking about crack right into you it was in that pipe it was like nobody knows do they did but there was a new station they were talking about two people about his rest and all the stuff and they interviewed this guy goes, come on man it but it smokes a little crack every now and then everybody smokes a little crack every now and then great quote from a mayor right and Bears won him know you wasn't saying it Jesse did I think it went to jail came out and got re-elected yes he will deceive very forgiving LOL you guys are giving you showed me how you can choke me last time with the tie did you get a break wait I know I didn't but you know new man is just take the back of that I cut it put a little piece of velcro Annie Chen you at the same time but I think you going under the tide to try to start the choke actually I mean you're making yourself on there like maybe 10 armbar or something like that like I didn't really listen to someone grabs ahold of your collar the same thing collars are real problem in Jiu-Jitsu the real problem if someone gets deep on your collar with a suit you're right yeah I would have to get it I have to get a Elsa and Anna have to hold on to this park is it can loosen naturally unless you're really good at like cuz it loosens doesn't this is system to this I think I think if you different we sure you're a tough guy you are actually trained martial artists to meet his I'm not saying it'll be easy to grab your tie and took you to death what I'm saying is it's one more area of vulnerability that doesn't need to exist but see I'm disagreeing with you and saying like I was going to fight to the death I would wear the suit would look good let me tell you something about CIA are they f*** yeah man built a secret service guy is supposed to be protecting the present a bunch of those guys are Savage guns that too and I think it is actually a few weeks if you hear more from these people they have self discrediting but but if you if you found them it's just that they don't deserve in the end and I think attracts a lot of people to that will fit you nuts there's definitely something to be said for that yeah it's definitely something beside me like I'm not in favor of banning these people yeah but I'm not also I'm also not in favour these people being able to espouse hate speech everywhere they go and to be able to indoctrinate people's Wells like I don't know what the actual do trust while I do not trust this state to decide what comes Lightspeed I don't know I didn't believe that I mean in the UK that proven that they are capable of doing things Canada right okay so in that case I'm for abolishing the idea of hate speech we have the police will investigate you for non crime if it's offencive right on crime website website and hate crime has a paragraph on non-crime hate in okay and what they specifically say is if you've heard some Epsom said something offensive to you and you believe that the person said something because of you you were one of the protected characteristics because of race gender sexuality disability whatever then you report back to the place to get the logs in the hate crime statistics as a hate crime even though there's no crime and he retweeted a poem that was B transphobic and people were upset about if I didn't write the poem you just retweet the time the police investigated his retweet and he said to them have I broken the Lord they said this isn't a crime is unknown crime hate incident and the actual phrase the police officer used I'm not joking was we have to check your thinking right now and then when the police PlayStation just one road police officer getting a bitmap this is standard practice commission guidelines in the College of policing an alert on my email the first time they give you if it senses movement and alerts you and I open it up and there's my dog Bella just in the beginning of a horror movie if you get an alert on your phone and back at home there's a guy just staring in the camera what's a good premise for a movie so then I as I'm saying that to my opening act who wasn't a ghost I get another alert and then this comes up oh yeah you can see it up there that's George Carlin that's a man with a wrench yeah or a man in a trench coat with an Uzi this is 10:00 at night the only people home where my wife and my daughter this is on the second floor there is no Shadow coming in the thing it's a ghost that's a legit that's not a person for sure my wife is the only one in the house my dad just like a few moments of your time do you know all this report and you have a video of it was it moving or something but I have a video of another thing in the same office so I can show you this is weird yeah it looks way different in this picture with when it's smaller than it does Wentz large with which is scarier what is large it looks more like a person yes he does seem it seems like you know the light is behind him right like yeah you got to keep the outside right edge of it is sort of highlighted like there's a light behind them doesn't know it is weird the big one that I remember is on my second spacewalk we're connecting this dish antenna and had to go on top of this big boom like a big pedestal and there was a connector that had it an electrical connector and we had or so to connect the thing and without it connected it wasn't getting any power or data to that antenna and I can get too cold and it's gazillion dollar antenna could be a worthless hunk of junk if you take too long you're on the clock cuz when it was in the shuttle was plugged in it was getting its heaters were on and now you got to plug it back in to get the heaters back on in a certain amount of time and so we're okay we go together like it doesn't fit at least two pieces of equipment sat next to each other for like a year in Florida and I like a warehouse never thought well maybe we should make sure that Ono unfit you know what do we do so we're shoving and went shopping so hard we're pushing so hard that the guys inside the space station said they could have filled the space station shaking like that's how hard we're trying and if we see little metal shavings come off and windows they can get in the connectors would like that so we stopped and and then and then this was like kind of my my big hero moment you know I kind of movies they like Brad Pitt saves the solar system and stuff you know this is my thing right it's not that exciting but I thought I had this idea together so I said to the one of my crewmates inside how long till the sun comes up cuz you know it takes 90 minutes ago around the the Earth and every 45 minutes of sun to see that coming up or going down so can't be that long and he goes actually about 10 minutes cuz we're behind the Earth and it was dark and then in 10 minutes of Summer's going to come up to my perfect so I took the the the female side I took the male side and I held it in my glove okay and I put it behind the structure weight something's going to be coming from here so I put it in the shadow and I waited for the sun to come up and it hit the female side and the temperature difference if you're in the Sun or in the shade is I can be up to like six hundred degrees Fahrenheit difference so let the sun hit and warm it up and I took them outside quickly out of my my insulated hand and away from the Shadow and I slit in the one Reddit wow yeah so hot Mansion wow yeah we're so happy we are going Delta people manufactured it we're so happy I have video this so you can end end we are going to the high fives in the suits were doing like</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> this is awesome bunch of videos online of you talking about space and your your your dream of being an astronaut as a young man and what what is it like just to see the Earth from above and beyond you lived up there for like what 95 days is 95 days was actually it's kind of a bummer to be honest with you because you know this if you saw that video maybe the thing is if you stay for a hundred days they give you a patch right 95 and the Space Shuttle Discovery shows up to bring me home and Mark Kelly was a commander because Garrett's time to hop in and come home and like man I just need five foot two and spaces longest and end in a row basically but it is a Russian that stayed up there for longer than a year and he has the all-time record when they come back like what what is 90 days like coming back because I've talked to people gone there when they come back their balance is all off the equilibrium so yeah it kind of is the most at least that's what's most noticeable when you first get back after the first thing I noticed it let me backup is how heavy things were again you know so I like I took off my helmet and I was holding it in my hand and it felt like I was holding the anchor to the USS Nimitz going to brush my teeth and be like too arduous you know does your body severely weakened in 95 days while back in the date back when I was going there so that mission my my long-term mission was back in 2008 and back then we were still losing bone to be in muscle mass as we're going up there too long about us about 1% of bone every month says about 3% low they don't anymore they don't anymore cuz we found out we came up with better countermeasures to prevent that what are the countermeasures basically working out and it's resistive exercise that that does it for you which we knew back when I was going but the problem was we had a we had this machine that was kind of a first-generation of the workout machine do large reps but but low load so you're doing like a lot of reps Atlanta at low weight and and that help but it but what helps it turns out we didn't we found this out kind of by happenstance but it turns out that high load Low Reps works much better as we got this new machine that you could really Crank It Up to 11 and the guys now then that are working out on that thing or coming home with no muscle muscle or bone loss at all wow that's yes Chris Hadfield went when Commander Hadfield came back he believed he said it took him a whole year to recover yeah I mean that was still like a nearly still kind of in the early days so he I don't know which machine he use he probably did use a new one but overall it does take to get everything back to get your full vestibular system back your sense of balance to get your ball your bone all your muscle back to Baseline it took me a year to get all that back to Knox County so strange that your body just wants to shrivel up when you're up there because there's no gravity yeah it's really interesting cuz you it's an adaptation in that in the body is is incredible so what is doing is it's realizing hey you know I don't have to carry my own weight anymore so why do I need this big bulky skeleton you're becoming kind of like a fish where you're you're just you're s******* all the bone density because you don't have to your your body realizes I don't need it. It's okay it's like a fish in water you know that have fish had very slender bones that's how I look at it like a fish yeah and we fight it by working out and I have to workout everyday everyday everyday how often and how much time days do schedule 2 hours now you're not on the machine for 2 hours and it's also prep and nearly getting changed and you know clean it up afterwards but so you're working out good our everyday space weird what happens if you don't notice if you in the beginning you don't even realize it but it's all building up and even without like if you have no hair to soak it up it just builds up like this thin film of water on your head like a coating of water he don't even notice it cuz it doesn't run down and then and somebody calls your name Eli Canelo and it just goes everywhere so if you have it on your arm you can kind of just go and do what do the sweater go flying and I your crewmates won't be too happy with you if you do this a lot but yeah wow that's a video of people doing that in space because you're not loading soda sit behind our bones need a stimulus to regenerate it happens to us every day so as you walk as you go upstairs that load that the bones feel the compressive load is telling the bone hey make some more they take that away in the bone stops making more and that's the problem people say they can't you just taste like calcium pills but it's not a mineral deficiency the 90 days that has such a 10 if you didn't do anything for 90 days at all you'd be in real trouble right yeah that's what's really kind of freaky as they thinking about like what if we don't fight this because all these adaptations should go through or not a problem when you're in space is only a problem if you want to come home right right losing that bone even like not using your vestibular organs anymore your semicircular canals are otolith organs you're not making use of those for your balance you just come purely individual what does initialism make you kind of sick you get kind of it's like being are sick or sea sick but what's your body adapts your fine so the question is like what would we become if we didn't fight it what if we just went with it and stayed up there doing a water balloon become you become the place I think in science fiction it gets it the most correct as if you watched the expanse are Washoe right because it shows people like these belters that live in partial gravity like their whole lives and they have much slept more slender bones and like they catch this like terrorist guy and they want to torture him and all they do is make him stand up in gravity and on Earth and incredibly painful for him and that would probably be a long time to get everything back if you went from Earth gravity to the space station and you lived up there for a year and didn't do anything about Allen came back to Earth me basically be like it would be hard to crawl right yeah you all all your if you don't try to fight it or stuff would come back probably about the same rate but what you would be really hurting with your muscle atrophy and your phone so you would you would lose a lot of your skeleton if you're up there for a year and did nothing and you would also your all your muscles that you don't use like in your legs and your postural muscles on your lower back you're not used anymore so they would just like waste away to nothing you be okay in your arms cuz you're doing everything everything you do is with your arms that's how you move this a Getaround is by pulling and pushing but you don't you know there's no walking there's no stairs there's nothing this affect the way you think it all some people describe a short-term memory they called like space brain and bro I got that too is it it's something that I never really noticed it but I don't know how much of that is real and how much is like like you're freaking out cuz you're in space right so it's distracting and maybe you forget like what that number was you're supposed to remember but if you're really in the middle of something and you're all excited and and and kind of can't remember somebody's phone number it's kind of like kind of like that I would imagine that just being up there breathing that recirculated air it's got to be odd right yeah and it might stink but I don't know because the other thing that happens if you have this big fluid shift so right now we have a lot of blood pulling up in our legs and are our heart it's most important job of courses to feed the brain oxygenated blood and then when you take the gravity Vector out of the picture the heart sends too much to the brain and the stuff doesn't collect in our legs anymore and it all shoots up here and he get the shift of all that blood volume to your upper body and your head gets all puffed up bro yeah like night so my first night in space I went to sleep which is kind of hard to do cuz you're in space you don't want to go to sleep Friday and on that first night I woke up in the mail tonight and I could have sworn I was standing on my head doing a headstand are hands-down I'm like why am I standing on my head in my sleep this is strange right and then I looked at the one that's how they are time and space so all the blood was just kind of pooling in your head yeah it does feel like hanging by gravity boots or something it feels exactly like that and then after a day to you get used to it and it doesn't bother you anymore but you feel congested because you still have all this volume up here so your sense of smell and your sense of taste are all dead and it's kind of like yeah it's kind of like when you have a cold and in your sense of smell and your sense of taste are like not a strong so it's like that all the time that's how we take to recover we have every hot sauce known to humankind up on the space station relax Sriracha we got you know Louisiana Cajun fire sauce and whatever we got the whole stock pile of it because you pour that on everything so you can get some taste cuz otherwise everything tastes really plant oh wow what are you eating up there I was terrible is it freeze dried foods mostly or you don't go for the food which is essentially MREs like military freeze-dried irradiated you know infinite shelf-life kind of stuff and the Russian food is also based on their military rations but from summaries Russian food actually tastes better but the problem is when a presentation because it comes in cans so he get these these cans and even though it tastes good you open that can up and you look at it it's like God looks like dog food just like your jild and yeah but it's just like so unappetizing when you open that can open now would happen if you brought fresh things up there would they would they rot at the same rate to do with rotten America yeah don't get the thing is we have no Refrigeration we didn't when I was there they have to have a small refrigerator now so you can't have anything that needs to be refrigerated but you would usually like for the first couple days we take a bag of fresh food and we took like sandwiches and and and fruits and vegetables and stuff and then because that's the last time you're going to have it after that it's all going to be just the stuff in the so you can't have anything that needs to be refrigerated but you would usually like for the first couple days we take a bag of fresh food and we took like sandwiches and and and fruits and vegetables and stuff and then because that's the last time you're going to have it after that's all going to be just the stuff in the packets that you add water to</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> we talkin about how wrong they got the future in like space 1999 I think Blade Runner was like now right didn't we discuss this like last year 2019 like we got everything wrong what the timeline was the timeline is totally wrong but I think that the overall overall direction is is right in a lot of this stuff and we'll get there I do believe that if we don't end up killing each other or have some horrible catastrophe like a asteroid hit us we're going to end up living in space and have that kind of Star Trek future I mean I really think that's our destiny as long as we don't screw it up man how far out are we looking at Star Trek Star Trek might take a while do we get like warp drive and all that kind of years and we got to find out how far do you think we are like if you had a wide timeline of like literally being able to go to another planet you know tomorrow is it something we could do in a decade if we really really really want to keep saying that I think he's right I mean it's it's not a question of technology did the big missing piece I think in an understanding about what that would be like is is the effect of radiation on it and the human body there's engineering Solutions we could come up with for that no please for the prolonged journey to say yeah come on Turney what you start talking about it was so right now I like on the space station I took a bigger radiation hit then I would have if I stayed at home but you know that I took was not that much it's like like a tenth of a secret or something I mean it's like it was pretty so sievert if you take one Seaport teaching your chance of getting cancer depending on your age and gender about a couple additional percent can you mitigate that with supplements like Is there iodine that you take or something along those lines there's some maybe antioxidants but I take that that's that's not a Panacea is not going to fix this problem that could help maybe they say take iodine tablets right if you're exposed to radiation is not like something that they recommend yeah for the reactors take that protects the protective function of someone under the organs I can't remember but it's not going to solve that's not going to solve this problem but you can Shield yourself with anything that has hydrogen in it is a pretty good Shield so watered great like when I was on the space station I put a big water jug around my head and liquid hydrogen or even plastic that's made is is pretty good okay so you can have like conceivably a light plastic suit that you wear that could Shield you from a lot of the radiation on the way to Mars is actually a company in Israel that way it is Tammy with NASA is going to fly these like vests on to try to Shield the people you can also put it in the hole and or we can have just a storm shelter cuz there's basically once when we're on the space station were above all the atmosphere but we're still below the magnetic field of the earth so we still get we still enjoy a lot of protection from radiation once you go out can you go to the moon or Demars then you're basically hanging it out there you're not you no longer protected by that and so you're going to take either GCR Galactic Cosmic radiation which is just everywhere out there sounds terrible sounds bad GTR they can do a lot of damage that a lot of energy there there's accelerated to like near relativistic speeds like near the speed of light and then and then there's a solar then you got to worry about solar flares spu solar proton events and those don't come pick those are very unpredictable and some other a little bit predictable with sunspot activity but but they come every once awhile there giant spikes they last a couple hours to a couple days and they could totally fry you there even worse f*** yeah so conceivably we could send people to Mars and halfway there they get cooked yeah she have a six-month window will you have to just roll the dice well so what you can do it you can have a storm shelter right it will you put like a lot of this shielding and if you get detected the spe the GC are there all the time but the solar events you can you can detect them coming and you have enough warning time to get everybody Into the Storm show how much time do you have proton radiation then you start you have like an hour so you got time have The Shield at the shielding I mean if it's a really huge one and we didn't really have any capability of Defending from it when we did Apollo and it was a between to Apollo missions there's one of these big ones and we just got lucky that it was in between so that seems crazy like one of those and bring you back and probabilistically speaking you probably have like an additional for 5% chance of developing cancer over your lifetime which is not like a death sentence you know it's a little uncomfortable yeah but we're getting better and things about it when we keep getting better Technologies better shielding we can actually come up with there's ways you could do active shielding with magnet you can create your own magnetic field around the ship and and ends of Star Trek force force field or fields or whatever so we're looking this way is that maybe we could do that there's also the other thing that we don't know we know exactly what radiation is out there we don't know exactly what that radiation does to humans the best we have to go on his like data from some of the atomic bomb survivors and radiation workers that work in like power plants and stuff to take some dose that's a different kind of radiation so right now the error bars are when we say that go 5% chance of cancer that's taking a very conservative estimate if we can find out what it really does to humans maybe it's a lot more benign and maybe we could sharpen a pencil say yeah it's acceptable what if people come back smarter what if it's like some f****** X-Men type s*** yeah baby kid like you know I mean radiation is always bad in real life but it was good in comic books they were involved in some sort of an accident wasn't dr. Manhattan wasn't that a thing with him as well I think so yeah I think so I'm not going to watch man I think he became who he is because of an accident at the document I believe so I was hoping that I had my kids after I did that it's like I'm hoping that they would like one day he needs kids R kids now I got a nine-year-old boy and a two-year-old girl notice anything unusual about them I didn't know I was concentrating on her blocks and one of them started floating</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what are your thoughts on this what was happening now with space-travel where it's transferring into the public sector for the private sector other instead of being something that the government handles now it's private companies is that a good thing it's a great thing is that yeah it because first of all it's not quite that black-and-white it in the media it's all portrayed as commercial space and like these over the truth is at least for the human orbital spaceflight they were doing a SpaceX and Boeing is doing with with their it's a part of the public-private-partnership sonance is working very closely with both those companies and we're working together and in a way it's not really that different for the way it's always been you know like massive didn't have a NASA Factory that built the Saturn V rocket is built here by like McDonnell Douglas and North American Rockwell built the North American built built the Command Module and a lunar lander private companies tractors but they're still private companies and what's happening now is just a slight change to the relationship between us and the private company's finances not micromanaging quite as much as they used to they're saying okay here's our top level requirements to get four people up and down to the space station that's a bit of a simplification cuz actually requirements document is like thousands of requirement but each requirement they leave it up to you so now sex is a lot more room to innovate then like North American Rockwell did when when they build the vehicles back during Apollo so that that and the other thing is different is due to funding the way the mess is paying its firm-fixed-price you know are all just like the space shuttle when we build an aircraft carrier it's it's Cost Plus Contracting which has been terribly abused and in has been horrible for the US taxpayer it would have says to the company is you can you could cost cos that's what we'll pay and in fact will give you a prophet as a percentage of the cost so that your innate your incentive as a companies like the Mets the cost as high as you can sell your profit as high as it can but that's ridiculous and and they had to do it that way because like nobody knew how much was going to cost to build a P-51 Mustang before so they came up with this mechanism but now it's kind of been using it to do things 4 in in the third thing is that the company's own the intellectual property so what that means is like Rockwell when they built the Space Shuttle couldn't like build a new space shuttle like build like Space Shuttle Enterprise or something and then go sell tickets on it they weren't allowed to but we can so we can we're going to build this Dragon we're going to take Bob banking to Doug Hurley two friends of mine are to be the first astronauts to ride it to the space station and one NASA NASA is our number one customer they're paying the bills so once they are satisfied we can end go make another one and sell tickets and take you know private individuals so really that's the key difference and I really think the 20/20 we're going to look back at 20/20 as it does a year that everything changed really yeah because the all those dreams of Science Fiction I like being able to take your vacations around the rings of Saturn and like all the like all the private space stations all that kind of stuff that we grew up hoping would happen when we were older I think it's really finally starting cuz this is this is the beginning of that infrastructure that good at that private-sector commercial infrastructure and and and ability to actually get it done</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> know when the first day you actually got up there was that the first time you would ever been in space on my first mission yeah the first day of his first time in space so your first view of the Earth from above window down there and it's in the corner okay so it's in the hatch and it's like the size of a dinner plate and I was up there you got a lot of work to do when you guys soon as you get up there so I'm working like crazy and after about 30 minutes I see this pale blue glow coming from that window and I'm like that's the Earth you know I should have a look at that and I'm super excited for this you know so I wanted to be ready so I pause I close my eyes I meditated and I'll call it whatever you want I just got ready and when I felt like I was ready I floated up to that window and I shut my eyes and I gazed out for the very first time at the Earth from space and what that felt like is really really hard to describe in words but if I had to pick one word to describe what I was feeling at that moment it would be really but man we've all seen pictures of the Earth from space okay we got like HD video coming down from space now where is just spectacular you can see stuff in that video that you can't even see with your own eyes like like the Aurora and all that and I'm sure like John Glenn and and like Eureka Guerin had no idea what to expect and so when they looked out and saw the earth a freaked-out you know and it and it was amazing and it was beautiful but it was it was underwhelming you're so high like I felt like I should be like some Heavenly Choir and that we should all hold hands this thing most people that have done it they talk about this realization that you like it is inescapable realization that we're all on this thing together and that all these boundaries of civilizations and cultures and countries and continents are all nonsense we're really just all on this one thing together yet it called that the overview effect and a lot of guys to come back and talk about that and they really feel it and it talk about a World Without Borders and you know and it's a beautiful sentiment and I and I don't I don't want to knock that in any way in the same boat you know but at that didn't strike me as a as a sudden realization it because I think it's cuz I knew that before I went that you shouldn't have to go and strapped into a rocket and blasts off and look at the Earth another basically we're all human beings I think it may I take the things that unite us are so much stronger and more important than it's been a crazy little things that divide us like race or sex or nationality or politics or whatever and in the end of the day we had this one home and and we're all stuck here in it together so I had that strong knowledge before I went and maybe that's why when I look down I'm like yeah there it is okay I get it but it wasn't like all of a sudden like that the the shade was pulled back in there is like suddenly a new realization about life is there one place that's the spot on the space station to get the view I really got a big window there's a huge window called the cupola that wasn't there in my first mission but was there in my second mission I'd say I got to see you at the second fatality window yeah it's not yet set Express pretty tight it's like a it's a dumb and so you get the full 360 View and it's spectacular wow and we tell the guys that don't get to do a spacewalk that this view is just as good as doing The Space Walk but it's not it's not but don't tell him because it makes him feel better. Don't listen what is a Space Walk Like a Man slim to none when I first got there to tell you when you're interviewing to become an astronaut to go talk to some of the other astronauts and so I went in there and we have his presentation about space walking and it seem like to be the like the Ultimate Experience just an incredible thing and I wanted to do it bad so I went I'm talking to this one at 9 is pretty tall guy those who they can't tell from the podcast I'm 5-4 okay so I'm not like that like a real powering individual little vertically challenged I guess and I'm talking to the real tall last night and I said you know just heard about the space walking sounds awesome I've been living in California I've been doing like some rock climbing some scuba diving maybe that make me a good candidate to do a space walk in the store last night looked at me like right now he laughed in my face what are you how rude I know it might my first thought was you know I thought I was supposed to be polite and this guy like was not being nice but he was exactly is being brutally honest you know it's kind of tough love and you like listen the suit is one-size-fits-all you're going to get in that thing is going to swallow you up and you're not gonna be able to do anything you can be useless so is it possible forget about it so I was kind of pissed off. so I get there I got the job and I go down for my first training exercise which was in this huge pool we got in Houston and it's like it's a hundred feet wide 2 ft long 4 ft deep and we can fit like most of the space station in there and they got a crane it comes by to put you in the suit which ways you know something like a hundred 75 lb and stuffy with urine it to get picks you up and it popped in the water and you float it's kind of like being up in space and that's how we train so get down there's my first very first exercise and I could tell in the first 5 minutes of this training exercise that big tall astronaut that laughed in my face was right to the arms and the legs a little bit and they have is actually three different size upper torsos there's a does a medium a large and extra-large but that said it's limited in in because it cost a lot of money to make different sizes so there's only the gloves I can tell her cuz that sucks in the most important thing but I'm getting my butt kicked you know and I and I got it needs Improvement which is a NASA nice way of saying it failed right but I wasn't ready to give up I went and I knew I was going to need help so I talked to the people that make that suit and it did some of those things are like they shorten up the arms they fix it up a little bit for me and then I talked to the trainers and we said okay yeah we got to think outside the box here if we give you the standard procedure you're going to be at a disadvantage but maybe we change your body positions instead of going straight onto the worksite may become at the work site from the size I get more reach that way and we start working at it and we got better and better and the story is that I got to eventually I got the highest possible qualification to do the most complicated spacewalks we do and ended up doing three different spacewalks career and a big tall guy in my face get to do any space station that's floating around and you're just hanging by a cord yeah hold on tight and prepare you for everything except for the visual so when you like her in the pool you're staring at the pool wall when you get up there and you see the whole earth below you some people go out there and get like a sense of fear of falling write the Space Station's moving 17,500 miles an hour but so are you so it's kind of like doing the wing wing walking on an airplane but with no air to blow you off the win so when you look at the Space Station's is Rock Solid but you look down and some people get the fear of falling in and then they hold on real tight which is a terrible terrible mistake because we called spacewalking but you're not walking you doing everything with your arms so you can wear your arms out exactly climbing and get like kind of totally thrashed in your forearms and it now you that claw hands useless you can do that and you got like 7 and 1/2 hours ago and that's bad so you're out there for 7 and 1/2 hours yeah diaper as well so during a training exercise I waited till like the very end just in case you know and I let one go right before they pull me at the pool one day and I resolved never ever to do that again that's it that's no we keep all these records I don't know it was God that record it's not me so you just have to let it go when you're up there so what it what are you doing when you're out there so if you're doing seven and a half hours worth of work you're basically doing maintenance so it's kind of like being a mechanic or a technician the way I described it to put the suit is like so hard it restricts everything you do that is blown up to about four pounds per square inch and so even just closing your fist takes work cuz it did the suits like a balloon and want to stay like this and so just closing your fingers is is takes effort and over 7 1/2 hours I guess really fatiguing you're moving your arms everything is an denim suit can only move like you can't do this right you can do this maybe so your your your ability to raise up your shoulders is really limited so you're trying to do all this work but you're working inside the suit and I described as like it's like trying to change the oil in your car while wearing a civil suit of armor what kind of Maintenance are you doing on the outside of the spaceship clean the windows getting the bugs off and on top of the space station we swapped out a bunch of batteries that we're getting old stuff like that like not work on this particular space while we were assembling a robot that we took up there but we did other things like we put a new antenna on top of the space station we swapped out a bunch of batteries that we're getting old stuff like that</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> underwater exploration as well what have you done there I live for two weeks in the bottom of the sea Jesus Under the Sea which works out to be about no that's are panicking now it's about 60 feet but the but the cool thing was we stayed there for weeks while I'm at know if your normal if you normally scuba diving and you go down 60 ft you have 60 minutes and then you got to come back up or you or you get too much nitrogen in your blood and you're going to get been right so so we if you put it is not a problem if you just stay the prom is then if you stay you build a ball that nitrogen in your blood that you can't go back up so if you run out of air or you lose sight of your buddy or something you can't go to the surface cuz within a couple hours you'll be dead wow so you have to stay down there and we use cave diving techniques and that we did a lot of training for to be safe and we have redone in tanks redundant manifolds redundant regulators and we can head valves that we can flip around so we can always make sure we could get air without ever having it in an emergency ever having to come up cuz coming up is not an option so eventually get out is a freaky thing it takes about a day and what you do is you take so we're living in this habitat and it was kind of like a submarine on the bottom of the ocean but it didn't have a motor so just like stuck on the floor like a big like a big guy selander and it had a hole cut in the side here and the only thing in the ocean that was the air pressure inside glow can I taking a cup and flipping over putting it in the bathtub and trap in the air and you just scuba dive on down and then you swim into that thing and it have been with your pop up in that hole it's like you're in a swimming pool inside the habitat and then you just step out into the habitat so this process of getting back to surface-level takes a day we have to do so we do to close up that hole and you convert the habitat into a pressure chamber and we do is he very very slowly bring the pressure back to sea level so you decrease the pressure and you slowly is it as if you're slowly slowly going up in the water column and it over as you do it gradually that the nitrogen slowly come but your blood and you can feel it kind of tingles wow over the course of a day just like you try to lie still in your bunk and just like read a book or something and it but you feel like this tingling and then after about a day of that they get you all way back to sea-level slowly so that the nitrogen but you know what it is it's like if you take a can of soda and you shake it up if you open the top quickly that's it that's a great now what's freakier being in the bottom of the ocean or being up in space space is more surreal the floating the the Earth out the window the views are better but being a down there was pretty well to ever once we doing this experiment where I had my crewmate and had an ultrasound and we can just tell him it is sin experiments to do these docks in Houston looking at the screen but there's a delay I'm supposed to find her kidney and am I searching around for a kidney and then I look up and look out the window and I see a 6-foot hammerhead shark right out the window and we have a guy in the water and I was and I dropped a giant I promise you know and see her liver explode on the screen or something and then unlike patients fine yeah that's got to be really weird right your ear in that thing and their world for how long 2 weeks yeah cuz that the weirdest animal that you saw is the Hammerhead the scariest thing I saw was one that I was taking a dump go into the pool could you use can you do when a flutter in your pool right this course that Caddyshack you know what the right so what you do is you go if you don't take a tank you just take your mask in your fence when you go down naked we had a mixed-gender crew so trunks but you know you just go down and have to swim I don't know it's like maybe 10 15 ft this not that far and there's a gazebo which is just a little Dome for that has air inside the middle of the Atlantic Ocean like with no tank note in your 60 feet down it's night you can't see a thing but you can see this little gazebo you swim to that you pop in and it got are just about you let in some fresh air and then you hold on and you just take off and Trunks and you just let it rip for the prom is the fish get accustomed to this Jesus yeah so they go there knowing that you poop as soon as you drop in the water at night it's like the dinner bell gone off his like the school yeah yeah cuz this is feeding time until you feel them like the back door the worst are the angelfish cuz that shaped like right up in there defeat down there scuba tanks at night at night with the sound of the ocean like like lapping against the the Dome and you looking down in this endless black you know just a black void and you're thinking about every single scary ocean movie like Jaws you know the Meg whatever they have best all those scary movies right and you think about all the things that could be down there can't help up going with you what kind of freaky and then you finish you put your mask back on and I took a big breath and I went down and I open my eyes in my in my mask in the darkness with my flashlight and I saw like right in front of me this huge eyeball like about the size I don't know if I can have a saucer you know like this pic is staring unblinking right at me and I free I just tore off for them for the pool for the moon pool and the habitat I jumped in there a surface I'm screaming I'm screaming and my crew come running think I like I've been bit by a shark or something and I'm like and it was Goliath grouper yeah those things could literally the person yeah it it is big enough that's for sure and so it was it just a side of it scared the heck out of that so where were you were in the Atlantic how far away are we from like Florida where you at we are just off the coast of Key Largo live down there yeah there's looks like a giant largemouth bass that's what it's like if you go bass fishing they're so similar to Bass like in the way they look that's another quick story about down there so I went out for a night dive once and I spent the beautiful thing about saturation diving like this as you can do basically infinite Time bottom time if you're not limited to like 60 minutes you can stay up there for six hours and do whatever so as not doing this night to have and I found this beautiful shrimp and was just spectacularly gorgeous is like translucent you can see through it uses organs move like internal organs like doing anything and I stared at it for at least just helmet light on it and just sat there and stared at it and it was really beautiful and I come back inside the habitat I'm kind of hungry and the best space food we got is shrimp cocktail grouper you to feel bad like a nice grouper sandwich in Florida but probably trying them out because they get hung out with you that big you probably have to eat so much non-stop buffet for those guys and so when you're down there and you're doing all the swimming you're using a rebreather no raising tanks regular scuba tanks and what is the capacity of Tanks like how how long can you stay down just swimming around 4 we have to and if we can isolate MKC one of them Springs a leak but you don't have that much more time than the standard take what we have is refill stations all around the floor with high pressure hoses so we have these quick disconnects on our on our system that you can plug in and fill it right back up and then you get to go for you know another couple hours so when you swim to go take a poo you have to do that if to wear the tank or did you not hold your breath just hold your breath that far how far you going back but that's all were you know another couple hours so when you swim to go take a poo you have to do that if to wear the tank or did you not hold your breath just hold your breath you're not going that far how far you going like 15 feet or so in total pitch-black there's a light on the Gazebo but that's all</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> 1 things I want to ask you about space is we we always hear stuff about space junk about satellites and just junk that's floating around the atmosphere how much of a concern is that and what can be done about that stuff it's a huge concern it's a very very big problem in in the in the certain orbit around the Earth low earth orbit and also at the geostationary orbit so they're very that's where you can put that communication satellites and stay over one spot of the earth those are very polluted you knows a lot of junk and it is very dangerous and it's it's a real problem is hard to clean up over time eventually even even at higher altitudes is still a little bit of atmosphere like individual atoms eventually that slows you down it does to collisions eventually slow down So eventually it comes back but it could take a long long time come back to her anymore junk the best thing we can do smarter they get SpaceX we take our second stages and over NASA missions and after after we it's accomplish this Mission we keep enough gas in the tank to burn into one more time and bring it back in one piece so doesn't blow up into Smithereens and cause more junk whenever we do anti-satellite test though the child that is China did one relatively recently and we've done in the past there's like two words because they create giant cloud of junk and and we have to still we're still have to live with that Concepts on the table for how to get that stuff out there some ideas of using lasers that lays the things and in and make subtle changes to their trajectories and orbits but it's all the Technical Solutions are challenging and expensive so I don't know of anyone idea that's going to like just solve this problem easily cuz we seen a map of the Earth and all the different satellites that orbit it now and all the different pieces of could have been identified it's crazy the amount of stuff in it seems like nobody kind of thought it through they just sort of did it and left the junk up there and that's what humans do man I mean like we've been dumping stuff in the oceans forever and not really giving much thought to it and now we're finding giant gyrus of plastic or than you know so yeah first spacewalk wanted things we had to do was had to bring him his handle they were going to use in a subsequent spacewalk it was like it is we call Addie handles just basically a half inch piece of aluminum around like this that you can attach to something and carry things so that is big chunk of aluminum and we brought inside of my spacewalk partner Rick looked at the thing when we came inside us a whole shot shot straight through it like a millimeter in diameter is really small but it went right through half-inch thick solid aluminum he looked at that he said man if they hit one of us and he didn't have the finish that statement cuz of the stuff is moving generally speaking about 10 kilometers per second so it's like roughly 10 times as fast as a rifle bullet so something like that hits you could be a Fleck of paint hitting you at that velocity of a hitch in the suit you're in a hundred percent oxygen environment and you're just going to Flame up I mean instantly can bosses can be really bad day so he didn't have to like you said you know when he said that he'd have to finish it and we both looked at it and then I looked at him and said yeah but you're six-foot-four so statistically what it does is a couple times I was inside the space station at her just take a hit but I didn't hear the so that ping is probably something bouncing off something or going through something so the station at shielding it's called Whipple shielding and it's basically a piece of of a wall a thin piece of metal that stands off from the hole so the thin piece of mail is never going to stop this thing but it would hit that hypervelocity it breaks up into lots of little tiny pieces and it's almost like a fluid that point is like these look like at that come with a cloud of dust and then when it hits the whole there's individual pieces don't penetrate so just it just shatters it and that was that works at window it had it is hit the shuttle when do you know it has multiple pains and its really really strong but we came home with big it looks like La Quinta Rockets kicked up and it tastes really yeah we've we've seen that wow that's a little scary Jesus Christ a little about micro meteors and then there are micrometeorites but there are those two when you get out of way from Earth orbit like if we're going to go back to the Moon then there's no more human-made junk but there is those micrometer I just out there and that they could do the same kind of damage but there's a lot fewer of them the density of those things is a lot less than what you experienced so it's if you're going tomorrow I'd worry about the radiation first and then micrometeorites I like down the list to see so many things to think about</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> and hopefully we will be able to use this one like a hundred times at least now is there any Innovation or any breakthroughs in fuel and in the type of propulsion systems that you need me to do it conceivably is there ever going to be a time where we have like a like a Star Wars X fighter that can just go shoot off onto its own that you know there's a potential for more advanced more efficient thrust engines in and probably one of the most promising ones in the new term is actually a nuclear engine a nuclear thermal pocket where you instead of using combustion to propel hot gases out the back of your nozzle you refuse a nuclear reactor and you take hydrogen nuflo it over that the heated up like super hot and shoot out the back without lighting it on fire and if you do that you can actually get much more thrust at with much less mass of a few like a smaller fuel tank but more thrust overtime so that's one possible way to go so it's conceivable that wonder that could be a standalone unit doesn't need thrusters that eject it still would look like a regular rocket cuz at the back of the of the nozzle still have like Fire come out the back but we just be superheated instead of letting on a fire to heat it up you do it there you go. So the top one is traditional in the second one's a nuclear one man in flying over the reactor instead of having liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen then you just all you need is a liquid hydrogen's wow that's one way but it is short-term the advance you're sitting there with that starhopper is that it's still a traditional chemical propulsion rocket so it's got fuel and oxidizer which is liquid oxygen has no oxygen up there to have fire you need to Pyramid right so you need the oxygen and the fuel and a spark and you have to bring your own oxygen if you're in space cuz you can use the you know how that was so you carry liquid oxygen and some fuel and in the Falcon 9 for example its is basically kerosene it's Rocket Fuel base rp1 but it's basically kerosene mixed with liquid liquid oxygen the engine you saw in that starhopper is advancing different cuz what he uses it still uses liquid oxygen but instead of kerosene that uses liquid methane and is actually not as efficient it doesn't have a quite that the specific impulse which is a measure of efficiency it doesn't have that quite as good as hydrogen it's better than kerosene but not quite as good as hydrogen but here's a thing you can make it on Mars and that's why that's why you aren't feeling that engine because you can go to Mars and you don't have to bring your gas to come home so that was the big knock on going to Mars for the longest time is that you never be able to return you do you have to have to wait two years for the trajectory for the plans to come back around when do they come home so you do at the stay awhile but did the beautiful thing is if you can go someplace and and gas up again fill up your tank without having to bring all the gas with you that's huge right you can you can be so much you can carry so much more that way and and that's what you can with a carbon dioxide it's in the Martian atmosphere and the water that's in the ice that's on the surface of Mars you can have a reaction process by that allows you to create to take those two things make liquid meth and you can have that a tank of that ready to go and all done robotically you can get the Telemetry back saying we got the gas and then you go now how much are things can accelerate now that you have all these different companies competing against each other that's as beautiful as it is like the pace of technological changes like really going exponential again just kind of like it was during Apollo so we're back into that really rapid that fast-track we kind of fell off of that for a little while and then I sing about what's the biggest difference between working at SpaceX and work at Nasa now it's a business decision speed cuz what will make up my mind quickly now the reason we can do that as we got a tremendous amount of agility cuz sometimes when you make up your mind quickly you make the wrong decision right but if you hurry up and figure out they made the wrong decision and he have the agility to Dan say Okay that was not right let's try not something else then it works at Nasa you know we had all these contractors and suppliers and and a very cumbersome kind of system that we took a long time to make sure we made the right decision because changing things was prohibitively costly but SpaceX doesn't have to worry about that now what is the difference in the way SpaceX is handling it you said Boeing has something what are they called again so NASA commercial crew program in a selected to commercial companies to partner with SpaceX and Boeing and sews bowling is using and an older Rockettes been around a long time called Outlets and they build a capsule to go on top of that called the Starliner and so this is strictly for commercial flights well if Emily is for it is said that the anchor tenant if you will that the core customer is still NASA has NASA is going to use both of these Rockets to replace a space shuttle and we won't have to beg the Russians for rides anymore what's the name of the Starliner we're used to be called a cst-100 POS 100% works but that's a good REITs a good vehicle kind of similar and its design a little bit and do it while I was pretty dope Wheatley Splashdown in the water and this one lands on land what does airbags so do wow surrounded by these gigantic airbags and bounces and hits the ground but doesn't bounce cuz that that's not good for people robots don't mind but if you bounce like that you're going to be really upset so it just hits in and kind of like airbags to deploy in a car and they deflate and then you're done and so this is on the same sort timeline as the SpaceX ship little longer cuz they're talking about extending the mission for Bob and Doug and keeping them on the space station so they need more training sorry Bob and Doug and their equipment is keeping them from losing all the bone density and when does Elon go to space do you have to have the system work in before you put the boss in the capsule and shoot them up in the heavens he's got a lot of work to do here so I don't think he's going anytime soon he does eventually when when when we get this up and running it does eventually want to go he talks about he wants to die on Mars just not on any text we thought that way maybe we can get them high again</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> churches to me it seems like if you pay attention to the track if you track technology look where it's going things constantly improve they constant with we we demand constant Innovation and we're already wearing these things on her body and watch is now a lot of people wear in the Apple watches in the Samsung and all the Google watches and it just seems inevitable that it somehow or another advances to a point where there's a chip or something you wear or so plate that they put in the back your head and screw in yeah but anyways like black mirror and it has the problem may not be good I mean but do you have a sense of history that you are first of all you're amongst one of the rare human beings it has ever been in space and then to your working for a company that is at the very tip of the Spear of innovation like the that you are at the front of the line in terms of creating viable methods of sending people into space and returning them I feel extremely fortunate you know at that to have that experience I had at Nasa and had the visceral experience incredible experience of flying in space doing spacewalks I'll bring robot arms launching on the rockets and all that and then coming to SpaceX and being there at the end in the relatively early days and and being there for seven years I feel yeah I feel pretty satisfied to see I got incredibly lucky to see these things and be in the room where it happens you know it's it's pretty remarkable now so now I'm now I'm still Consulting the SpaceX but I'm a full-time professor at USC's and I'm teaching and I'm also working on TV show so now I'm like taking that those incredible experiences I had open up a lot of other doors and I kind of like work and work on the TV show I find myself liking there in the writers room with a whole bunch of really talented creative people why just no way in a million years I would this would ever happen to me if it weren't for these incredible experiences I was lucky enough to have you know it's like that gets even Atkins really so real I can only imagine I mean I can only met you even especially coming from your childhood having that image on your wall and now really being a part of this massive change in the way human being going to be able to travel in Space TV show cuz you were talking about it off here before we started yeah so this is for all mankind it's on Apple TV and the way I got involved with this thing I was a big fan of Battlestar Galactica that the Ritu was awesome was so good and that the whole concept and everything all that other things are exploring and in science fiction is always as best when it's like an allegory and the way they explored things are happening in society like terrorism and stuff the way that way was depicted as in an alternate universe I thought was spectacular or something like that you have things stored or is there a TD up there there's no TV but there is we have all these laptops so they can set up files and you can you can give him like four shows that you like how long does it take for a show to download and space let it download it for you which is nice about your while you're working and then when you're ready to watch you just pop up the file so is it like a satellite connection Internet satellite it's it's kind of it it's a it's a KU Band system that goes to satellites that aren't part of NASA satellite so-called satellites of the data goes up to teachers and it down at Ground stations to White Sands and then what's your late-night you don't remember the numbers but we weren't getting at when I was there we weren't any live internet because all that bandwidth is being used for science to get that all the data from the experiments in the video yeah just Google searched random things we supposed to be doing your job in space so you get the shows and you're watching Battlestar Galactica at Colbert Report Daily Show and like New York Yankees game and it just in the background and so now I feel like you're the crack is bad it's kind of gear in space but you still can't connect to the home that seems like something that would go on a movie guy who is working on a spaceship in the movie is listening to a baseball game yeah I mean like battle so much about starting to like now. I'm in the final season in there like finding Earth I'm like it's right there in a spaceship you might be the only person ever while my commander was watching it too soon as I get them for you Lord David Icke creators Battlestar Skype session you know science fiction and science fact and had this is crazy feedback loop about you got to think about it first I could go back and look at 2001 and you see these guys using tablets in 1960 was a 1968 that movie came out and you know Steve Jobs one of those right and so this is crazy like interplay between fiction and fact and and I got to talk to her more about all this and then any invited me to come onto set for the for the final episode of Battlestar and you're not supposed to like the first 30 days you're back from a long-duration mission you not supposed to like go anywhere and I'm like look the only going to shoot this once I'm going to the last time I checked this is a free country and I can stop me so I went and I went all way up to Vancouver and I got to go into set amid all the cast I got to be a focus puller on the camera guy got to do that that that sticks in LOL wow I just had a blast an extra as a colonial marine in the back of a ship that gets blown up I'm sure that show is super complicated to make but I would love 5 which is not the most popular Network and it's also a reboot of a classic show so maybe it had like a bit of a stink to it but that was so much better than the first version of it it's f****** good man I mean you couldn't have it without Star Trek you couldn't have it without the original Battlestar Galactica but but at the end of the day it's kind of build on each other and Ron went off and did Outlander after that and now he came up and he says I got this new idea can I come by and maybe I like ya so you came to the place and then we sat down at the in the cafe and is it okay so I'm thinking about doing a show about NASA back in like the 70s and be kind of like a. Piece would be kind of like we have a cast of characters but they're all working on Apollo and it would be true to real life but it would be the drama of the people behind the scenes as it sounds pretty cool. Yeah I'm also with a slight twist that where we use an alternate reality and in his alternate reality things we start at that point but things turned out differently and we start talking about like how close the Russians were to actually beating us to the moon was not allowed people know about but when I was over there in Moscow I got to see actually there and they have a warehouse where they still have their lunar lander for example that they built they were really working hard on it so we started what if it like what what if the Russians got their first what would what would America then he'll think how would things be different today if that seminal moment of Neil and Buzz stepping out on the moon was it said Alexa in the owner of a cosmonaut doing it right and apple and they bought it and then he called me up and said what you want to work on the show and yeah so what is your role would you do there but I get involved like everything's I was in the writers room with her first coming up with basic ideas and sketching out like multiple seasons and character arcs and all that kind of stuff and then I got that done and get all the scripts and I read them all on a given notes on all the scripts and then they come to the set night and meet with the actors the cast and I give him the suggestions about like how to look real when they're in space and then I like work with the VFX guys I work with a stunt team I get phone calls from my hair and makeup people like do with their hair if they have long hair when they do a spacewalk and like you're calling the wrong but so you can pay a whole lot of money and go to Fantasy Baseball camp and like you get to like have batting practice with the Dodgers or something and they humor you because you paid a lot of money well it's kind of like that I keep waiting for them to say it like okay the fun is over get out of here it's go back to your day job you know but I'm like I'm just loving it that's why I'll see how much correcting do you have to do how much do you get the script and that doesn't happen that you can't do that that's not it depends and every Productions different the nice thing about For All Mankind has a really really want to get it right I worked on other projects where they say they want to get it right but then I like completely Bluff the laws of physics and and you know I'm okay with that cuz the Martian with the hand-cutting thing I guess I just assumed my students like nobody goes to see a movie for the orbital Mechanics for the story the characters and it doesn't make sense you watching something like gravity that was a big one lot of people got really like Neil deGrasse Tyson I get it he hated hated or you know since we're not close to each other out the inclinations are the orbits a totally different than that you're going to go from one to the other with a fire extinguisher I knew that was complete b******* don't get me wrong but that leap were they treating you like you're a moron they're treating you like there's no way you're going to be able to research this was something like you Someone Like You Rather that's your life so you know that's nonsense he's sitting there watching some hokey solution for something that would never work if it gets to the point where I like that's a beautiful thing about like doing this with televisions you don't have to actually be right just have to be believable it which of the bar is it like when I'm teaching my class at USC I got to be right but when I'm like maybe this could happen you know what the TV show it's easier but this TV show the wholesale changes to episodes not to interfere with their creative process cuz they're really really good at that and I'm you know I'm not worthy but I'm like yeah okay I see what you're trying to do you want this guy to be the hero you want this person to feel remorse you want this in end in the end over the course of time this person has a change of heart I get the story but what if instead of doing it this way what if the events occur like this cuz this could actually happen right and so I tried to change it and is one that like like episode nine and Lil Bit of episode 10 of season one we ended up sitting I ended up sitting to working very close with the writers and changing the all the technical content to fit to make the story work in a believable way and that it went when we do that and then you see it on the screen it's like so incredibly rewarding it's really fun that must be especially if someone is a Sci-Fi fan what you've had to dream lives here like I know you're for really like that you've gone from that NASA Tess SpaceX it's really fun that must be especially if someone is a Sci-Fi fan what you've had to dream lives here I can only afford really incredible that you've gone from that from NASA SpaceX and now to be able to create television shows that you can actually enjoy wow</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what what changes have been made since you go from the old shuttle model of that technology to the SpaceX Dragon crew think probably the single biggest changes is all the we've gotten a lot better at electronics and software so the vehicle is highly automated and that's why we can fly like like normal people that don't have like years and years of training because it's so much more smarter than the shuttle so much better but you're such a genius you're not supposed to use language like that you're goddamn out you're not so much more smarter the re-entry tiles likes and then that's that's what did Challenger know which one was Olivia Columbia that's what did Columbia in the the new design have they made advances and how that stuff is applied or is it a different surface that use yeah so so that that is something it's also not really worried anymore that the reason at Columbia took that damage was his phone like the big orange tank that's behind the space shuttle it sticks up above the space shuttle and some foam go off of it we always had some phone shutting off the thing and in the beginning we took that very very seriously as a major problem but the thing is is it's this concept of going to forget the name of it now described it so so you get away with something for so long that normalization of deviance that's what it's called so it's when you get away with something for so long and it was a deviant thing or something is treated as a normal thing and that's what happened to us cuz we knew that that phone coming off could do damage to the Space Shuttle and in the beginning we tried really hard to do something about it we treated very seriously but it was hard we couldn't really come up with an easy fix and the meantime we're flying and nothing bad was happening what was really happy as we're getting lucky and then eventually a big piece came off hit Columbia right in the wing and it shattered but nobody knew sure and they made a bad decision to not like investigate it further assumed it was okay brought him home and and obviously know what happened so it could be possible to fix something like that if they had known you could have been possible if we did a lot of things like when I flew we had a lot of things and places to try to fix that one we got to rid of a lot of the phone that was unnecessary we try to do things that stopped a phone we also have ways of detecting it so that we would know we had sensors in the wings we added a maneuver we do when we fly to the space station did like a picture of her where we took photographs of the of the heat shield to see if anything got hit so at least we would know and then we could we could shelter in place on the space station so if there's a lot of things we can do at the shuttle but goodnight the thing about with dragon in sand Starliner the new vehicles is a sit-on-top so there's no any for any phone that comes off the rocket is not going to hit you so problem solved so that that's one example of how we not to worry about that anymore is the surface different do they still have the same kind of tiles the heat shield is coming looks like the heat shield is that the material on the side of the cats on the walls of the castle is is made out of silica so it it's it's similar to the tiles but the material that's in the in the heat shield itself is an ablative material needs it kind of like as as it heats up its lights off and it takes the heat away with it and that's that's kind of more similar to like it was during Apollo is a much more advanced can we see that we go there will they give us a tour at that we can I bet wake up my available that I want to see a spaceship they got you should ask was my boss when he was here girl is there as the pain has a tiles but that he Chill on the bottom is is called a pika a carbon a blade ever so it's a different it's a different very high-tech material that is really really good it was standing tremendous amount to eat that that each other's way oversized you could use that thing at least 10 times and it really was originally designed for actually entry is coming back for the moon when you going much faster and you hit it you build up a lot more heat when you hit the atmosphere then just coming back from the space station so ultimately that's the goal for these things to take people to the Moon to take people tomorrow to take people well and reusable right this is just a start series ability is key and there's elements of this vehicle that are not reusable that trunk you see the thing the cylinder below the capsule is not reusable we throw that away that that the second stage in the Falcon 9 we throw away and you know you want hates that Holy Grail is 100% but affordable usability where you don't have to spend like it at a gazillion dollars refurbishing it in between flights and we're getting there in the next vehicle is going to be the real that's going to be the real hope we will we will we will get that Holy Grail with this Starship that that we're working out now so this is a top-secret one that you can talk about what it is you seem hesitant press conference in front of it in Texas not too long ago and she really showed out what it looks like yeah that is the test called starhopper so this was a beginning this is a test bed to test the engine to make sure that weekend but that's fake that's real that's real that is not CGI what is the jet coming out of the bottom buzzer that the bottom is a is there as a raptor engine is burning liquid methane and liquid oxygen and in those Puffs at the top or cold gas thrusters just to keep it pointed in the right way and so that's Landing now yeah my God that's amazing Bezos companies got all kinds of incredible stuff on Air Jordan board 2020 is that start but it's just a start tell me that again like look at that man play some War of the Worlds type s*** like Tom Cruise movie right there are flying over Earth and they were starting to land my God that's amazing did the video some people listening can go 150 m starhopper test more than 2800000 used out that's next days rocket and then that thing is going to sit on top of it or something like that thing and then we're going to get both back the rocket will land on its tail and then one thing after it goes off to the moon or even Mars it'll come back and also land out of town then we'll get both pieces will get 100% back wow and then we really got reusability.</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> the concept is terraforming right that is that's not going to happen I think even dealing with tell you that's not going to happen in his lifetime that's something that like generations for now we can think about it's that's that's hard so there's some sort of domed civilization like what yeah live in some kind of pressurized compartment some kind of pressure ships land on planets and people live inside the chefs and you can't go outside unless you wear a suit that's wear a suit inside if I gross to be really big and we also have to make sure it's really really well protected from radiation cuz even once you're on Mars have to worry about those GCR as in yeah really sitting around drawing up plans for that. That was kind of like like if we had to do it how could we do it this one thing you know if that came off the top of his head but it was that there was to raise the temperature or the change the atmosphere that's it like melt the captain in eject a lot of gas into the atmosphere and beef up the Martian atmosphere what a weird roll the dice that would be what time would it take to turn that into a livable environment that you're starting to really extrapolate a pretty far and it'd be pretty hard for me to give you a timeline that looks like giant that's that's a big one but it's as a proof-of-concept it's it's sort of a mean there is a theory right that you can alter the atmosphere and enough gravity that if you could put enough gas into the atmosphere of it stick around kind of like it's it's got it is possible you're not going to get to one atmosphere pressure like 14.7 PSI like we enjoy here but might be enough now there gravity is what percentage of Earth's sponsored so you definitely experienced a lot of the same issues that you have if you go to the space station so if you wanted to go from Mars back to Earth do definitely some sort of energy the. Yeah really interesting thing is like we know we have a lot of data we know what happens in zero-g cuz we have a lot of us have been up to the space station and Skylab and mirror and all that and we have tons of data at 1G cuz all of us everyday living 1G we don't really have any data in between so the question is is a half a g half as good or maybe it's like 80% is good Bryant and and is it linear or non-linear we don't know and that's why if we send people and we live on the moon or we go to Mars we live on Mars and we have data and I kind of moon is about 1/6 of the Earth's gravity so we'll get points in between and then we can figure out if this thing is there's a lot of stuff that happens to you that may be completely solved but even just the smallest amount of G but we don't know Georgie's an issue we don't know how much of an issue 1/3 G is now what about food like what are they going to do with food on Mars are they going to have to fly all the ingredients out everything out we'll just talk about missions that are that long caring all your food with you bringing it all becomes masks prohibitive you know you just got take so much and you know it doesn't work so we're probably if we're talking about like living for a long time I Mars Raven deep space missions we got to grow food so we can probably plants hydroponically like the Matt Damon movie yeah yeah because there's not really enough Dynamic pressure in a martian Windstorm to knock the antenna off the roof done this in the Comm system that's not really really listen I have a long day at work at SpaceX I come home I open up the book before I go to bed and I'm reading this like okay I got 62 souls and I got to cover 3000 kilometers and 52 moles of nitrogen hydroxide blah blah blah and I'm like it's like I'm still at work okay that makes more sense but that movie was terrifying like the idea that you get stuck up yeah the only part of the movie which I don't think was in the book that was not realistic at all was when he cuts his glove and does the Iron Man thing you can't really control it that you need a big hole realistic at all was when he cuts his glove and does the Ironman thing you can't really control it that he was spinning out of control us you'd also need a big hole to really get enough propulsion and then at your suit would deflate I mean it's just that she's not going to work</div>

It was only 200 people and I thought that's what my life is like it's like a day where 200 people sign a petition to get me fired as a professor my son can come in and say well that's not so bad it's like it's only 200 people say that online and look what's happening and then the support would be overwhelming for who knows how many people stration at the University of Toronto like they didn't take they didn't take it seriously at all called have me removed it didn't cause any didn't even caused a ripple know who it is 200 people and what was their motivation you based on that old because they think that the people who conducted the Inquisition yes but it look like I mean I mean this formally like 20 members of pimlott Sandra Buchanan's faculty that was Communications at Wilfrid Laurier wrote a letter supporting them so that's why it's not an isolated incident it's like no no they thought they were doing was right this Mass Hysteria ideologies have been completely connected to the same type of group think that's going against Lindsey Shepard in that meeting what what what I say crazy stressful it's it's the best way to describe it is surreal it's like I stepped outside myself I can't I can't put this in a box I don't know what to make of it I don't know what to make of the channel 4 interview you know it's like what the hell really it's it's it's crazy about these conversations are so limited by what you were saying for the day trying to get this 5-minute Sound by then and that's what televisions become it's a dying medium it doesn't make any sense doesn't make any sense to sandwich these commercials in every 15 minutes or whatever they do none of it makes any sense it's an archaic way of communicating ideas you going to do what you want with everything on my TV space requirements on YouTube so you don't have to do this twist the complex event into a short soundbite and entertain everyone no space requirements on YouTube so you don't have to do this twist the complex event into a short soundbite and entertain everyone</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> what is the timeline in terms of like does SpaceX have multiple stage timeline like a timeline for incorporating the dragon crew and then a timeline for the starhopper and then a timeline for additional projects in the future like as it is he thinking along these lines of like like charted out progress oh yeah yeah when we have a self-sustainable colony on Mars sooner or later that's the prison by which he makes every like every single decision he makes it makes it through that prism yeah so he's got an idea and he'll keep pushing and and you know he gives us aggressive timelines that we have to work too and we work really hard to try to try to meet him it's hard when you're doing stuff that this does this complicated to predict exactly how long it's going to take so yeah we end up off and falling a little bit behind but we that's the case though with everything that's that crazy right specialty lines never write notes predictions all wacky inventions there always a little off but we think such a smart guy and he's the most he is really the most driven person I think I've ever met I'll give you a story that the kind of Illustrated once interview 50 minutes and they interviewed at Elon and and myself and Scott Pelley was the anchor he talked to us and he said to me why did you leave NASA and come work for SpaceX you had like the best gig in the world you know going up on rockets and stuff why would you do that and I said well if you can go back in time and you are young engineer and had the opportunity to like get in on the ground floor and work with Howard Hughes when he was like doing all the crazy stuff he was doing it in his which want to be a part of that it's got probably look at me like with a deer in the headlights look cuz I don't think he knew what I was talking about but I was like that's what but then I realized as soon as I say that like oh my God I just made a terrible strategic error I compared my boss to Howard Hughes and know things didn't end up that well for Howard you know he went crazy and how's it going now I really kind of stepped in it right so it took a while I was like months later we were driving it in a rental car Just the Two of Us in Florida we were had a meeting at Nasa and we're driving back to the airport to get on his airplane to come back to LA and I'm driving the car sitting in the passenger seat and I said hey boss on TV and I compared to that Howard Hughes I just want you to know I was comparing you to the young dashing Starlet dating Howard Hughes not the old decrepit peeing in jars fingernail. he'll consider it and he'll kind of go into this unless I get transol stare off into space is too and you can see the wheels turning heat focusing at all of his intellect which is considerable on this one question and that's what was happening so I waited and then he turned back to me said you know Garrett I don't think it's an apt comparison okay good good why but I'm curious why do you think that and he said well none of Howard's designs as brilliant as they were ended up really changing the way we live our lives so we don't send like he made that the Spruce Goose which is an incredible airplane was all would you know trying to solve the problem during the war of rationing Goods across the oceans and giant wooden airplanes we don't do that the H1 racer was a beautiful airplane but it was a one-off and Eveready led to a large shirt designs that changed the way people live there so that was his objection was not that like I was comparing him to some creep but that he wants is really important to him to have the legacy of Jurassic Lee impacting the way all of us live our lives a kind of the way Steve Jobs did or others that that really move the ball downfield for Humanity that's what's driving he's such an unusual that you could make any kind of rational compares two other than maybe Nikola Tesla will you really stop and think what he's done and the fact that he doesn't know simultaneously these involving the boring project he's involved in Tesla and SpaceX all simultaneously and Tesla home solar all the the solar panels in the making solar tiles for roofs and he's doing so many different things at the same time it's it's almost impossible like it. I don't understand how he does it I still don't understand it you know it it's like kind of burn myself out just trying to do one of those things that is all of them and end and he does have all the advantages of wealth which helps you know so like he'll have meetings with us and he'll walk out of his last meeting and he'll walk across the street to Hawthorne airport hop on his jet and he's at Palo Alto in a couple hours and you can be first thing in the morning at Tesla he's got a staff to help some and you know he's got those advantages he he that isn't it anyway describe what are or that doesn't explain why he's able to do what he does I don't know how he does it to be honest the next stage of humanity people are evolving he's he's like looking at us from the next spot he's like hey guys I've got some ideas he's just an idea Factory and end his is knowledge I mean I've met a lot of super super smart people but they usually super super smart on one thing and he's able to have conversations with our top engineer's about the software and no the most Arcane aspects of that and it helped turn to our manufacturing engineers and and have discussions about some really esoteric welding process for some crazy alloy and and he'll just go back and forth and his ability to do that across all the different Technologies rockets and cars and everything else he does that's what really impresses me also the lack of burnout cuz he's been doing it at this incredible rate 16 hours a day for how long is whole life I think that's nuts I know and he still hungry for it and it is still taking on these new projects in new ideas and yeah you know what that pays seven seven years was a bad as like as much as I could take I know but it's just very confusing to me I just feel so stupid when I'm around him ultimate goal is to create some sort of a colony on Mars but he believes that this technology will continue to and to the point we will we will be leaving our solar system we will be making human trips into other solar systems into actual deep space yeah I mean hopefully that's at some point if we're going to survive you take a really long view you know the solar system is not going to last forever kids relaxed not in our lifetime they're so funny but but eventually we're going to have to find a new home if we're going to last forever and we all hoped it would last forever as a species right so at least most of us too so we got to get there but we got plenty of time and short-term important thing is at least getting out so not in just one place in the solar system because this you know something bad happened to this planet we got no backup and particularly if there is a natural situation supervolcano supervolcano tracked but someone like him to concentrate on solutions to some of the environmental problem we created for ourselves here that's really that's that was the thought behind Tesla I mean so so Tess was kind of like playing a save this planet and SpaceX is kind of plan B if you look at it that way weird to have a guy like that amongst us you know that we are working on so you just said that's one of the ways he does his time management this went away as he is able to do all these things just like he doesn't sit around and and and and Bs with you about like what's going on with the lesson or link the company was making the chips at so going to sign up for that I want to be an early adopter but once it does happen and it really does remarkably increase your your ability to interface with data that's the idea right said it ramps up the bandwidth and which people can access ideas and information is going to change the way we interface yeah being kind of extreme Have and Have Nots situation I get too far behind you are today I left behind you or if you have no internet access can you wear if you have no internet access right and then this would be kind of this could be like you're not another level of that yeah I'm worried I'm worried about that I got other things to keep me up at 9</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> it has a difference and then you know if you want to go further and talk about the ghost that show up, so you have a picture of a golden I show you that I don't ever show you that Jamie I don't think you have a ghost ghost where are your house I apologize if I'm repeating myself I don't know if you are I don't remember but I got one of those cameras how do you open email the first time if it senses movement and alerts you and I open it up and there's my dog Bella just you get an alert on your phone and back at home there's a guy just staring in the camera so then I guess I'm saying that to my opening act who wasn't a ghost I get another alert and then this comes up oh yeah you can see it up there found out look at that bro that's delete Chris keep away from Tom something you might not know but that's that's a man with a wrench yeah or a man in a trench coat with an Uzi this is 10:00 at night the only people who were my wife and my daughter this is on the second floor there is no Shadow coming in the thing it's a ghost that's a legitimate that's not a person for sure wife is the only one in the house and you think that's a gun is in could be a clipboard maybe just a really annoying surveyor from the dead a few moments of your time what does large it looks more like a person can make an even bigger Jamie can you make his image larger I have a ghost in my house then we hear things yes it does seem it seems like you know the light is behind him right like yeah you got to keep the outside right edge of it is sort of highlighted like there's a light behind them doesn't know it is weird over here ready to sauce and bread so have you ever had an experience that you could say you think is probably a ghost cause that everybody in the house has had a little something cuz your household it's not old I would like Poltergeist ride is over an Indian burial ground you never know what look at this video in the same office from The Nest video what's going on what am I looking at here did the thing move again bro 100% flies around doing lupd lose that's a bug is probably a moth oh my God you're a little fruitcake you're crazy person that's a bug do you want to see me I would dare ever happen to me real quick would be all in two dots above all right that's how it goes Its Tinkerbell that's what it is my wife thought someone was standing right behind her she's doing the laundry photos my daughter and turned in this note that was all that's so f****** thank you Jamie let's watch this what's watches at home can last stop any bug that's a bug video artifacts because it's moving very fast from the screen there's a precedent to this you have a low-resolution camera that's in front of your desk security camera low-resolution doesn't take a lot of frames per second the reason why it's so elongated is because it's passing by his camera and a thing as taking multiple exposures while while it moves through there's a thing called sounds of who actually elects George Carlin it's pretty cool out of your desk yeah the there's a thing called Roswell rods see how it looks so long like that uh and Roswell rods there was this guy me and Eddie Bravo back in the smoke too much weed everyday days we were convinced that there were these things that were moving too fast for the human eye to see and the other is gelatinous jellyfish-like creature that shaped like a tube that's right above your cursor Jamie is right right there on that one sort of iconic image of the Roswell Rod had me convinced like oh my God documentary I think a couple of documentaries I think of you go to Roswell rods, Idaho website dedicated to Atia it is nothing but a video artifact once there's a show called one of those monster shows f****** one of those History Channel shows in front of this fireplace or find this campfire yeah one of them he was actually Lantern but whatever it was they set up these two cameras one of them was standard resolution and the other wasn't was HD captured multiple frames per second like many many men in France riots very for high-resolution and in that one you clearly see bugs clearly see in the other one that's low resolution and it doesn't capture as many frames per second all those images are stretched out and it looks like tubes so exact same place at the exact same time with two cans right next to each other very different images one of them is all stretched out from a low-resolution camera like your security camera the other one is high resolution you can see it clearly a but I guarantee you 1 million percent that is a f****** bug alright I'll buy that one see if you can find that I can convince but that other one we all have a nice old church theaters The Comedy Store belly room scares me sometimes yeah I'm taking people up there just stand here and tell me if you don't feel weird in the belly room or something the dressing area whenever you're back there by yourself that's a weird feeling so sketchy but yeah that's a really weird feeling a pound of cocaine at night kicked out. Abercrombie stores get me kicked out of his home and his wife and I'll get out f*** you know I'm going to God damn, so he went to The Comedy Store to the thing he was working security at the store so we had keys to be at least I'm going to sleep on the stage I'm going to make it up here pitch black hello it's Carl I'm sleeping here if anybody's here wondering then here's cheers moving the clink clink clink clink is what the f*** is going on hello into the crowd into where the seats are and then another door shut and it's gone and he's laying on the ground in in the middle of the main room with a bunch of knocked over chairs something I grabbed his ankle and pulled him off the stage or or he did a lot of coke with Kennison he was right he was another one yeah what's a great store that is a great Sergeant he told it on stage one night at the store</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Rebel Wilson and committed to losing weight she's lost a ton of weight and people are mad at her are they really are being big they like her being big because she's big and I'm big and everyone's big and it's okay to be big and I heard it's healthy to be big and so like people are criticizing her for losing weight as well a little longer and then you're turning on us well she became a role model for certain people I guess and maybe this weekend and then I fasted Sunday night till Monday I went to yoga Monday morning didn't eat till right before my first pot and I didn't gain any weight at all that's great moderation moderation eating like s*** over but what was interesting was the pains back pain knee pain inflammation in your body does not want to have to process all that stuff and I think that maybe the route for many people with a lot of causes of pain and discomfort is just an inflammation heavy diet I can get all of that out of your system your body can what go to work on the stuff has to go to work on you get all that s*** out of your system in your body doesn't experience inflammation from your food right and if you're eating food that like you know grass-fed beef mycase elk in oread Hampshire vegetables not bad for you I just did it to try to find what I just did it to try to find out what it's like to only eat meat right when you have no carbohydrates one of the most amazing there's no crashing you would eat and you don't feel any different after you ate other than the fact that you don't feel hungry right like you don't crash right there's no ups and downs and Peaks and valleys my energy levels were amazing really how quickly how quickly 93 this morning I was weighing about 2:05 before I started this diet I do believe there are certain people that have an adverse reaction to some plants that's an Elimination Diet is all about us are trying to find out what are the things that bother you yeah but for me what I did is I just took a lot of multivitamins I took a bunch of different vitamins and nutrients supplements on top of this carnivore diet some only eating meat but then I'm taking all the essential vitamins and amino acids and I'm also taking fish oil so I'm nutritional bases bases right but I'm not doing it with food I'm not doing it with plants I'm only eating grass-fed meat and then I'm at work or elk and then on top of that I'm taking it fat from like bacon like bacon I need it fat because your help in particular is very nearly like grass-fed beef I'm fine but it with things like elk you really do need some extra sources if you don't have fat what would you start to feel bad does not want a low fat diet with low carbohydrates is a thing called rabbit starvation if you ever heard of that people got that in Antarctica is Antarctica in the cold cold climates where they were shooting rabbits and eating rabbits near literally starving to death even though they're eating all these rabbits is a rabbit have no fat on them so they're only eating this lean protein Ryan with no fat at all and you start feeling like s*** different explorers have found that to that living in places and trying to eat only the other foods that they could Harvest off the land they're eating animals like they had to take in fat if you don't feel really bad so a little bit would you say maybe 80% this is what I would say try it straight out and I think you'll be amazed how good you feel now is nothing like what is it like if you extend that to 90 days or you know 365 days you're going to feel like s*** eventually going to start breaking your body down right I don't know but in my experience in 30 days was enormously beneficial did say something in your post about a explosive diarrhea and needs to have a new name diarrhea is not strong enough for what I was experiencing a real house like someone was tapping into like an oil like an oil well that's a carnivore Advocate he's been eating this way for 2 years 2 years and he seems to think that it has to do with the colon adjusting to the factory body doesn't have any dietary fiber so you're not taking in any rice or bread or anything is going to absorb the water so you're right who's going to right now he is yeah yeah he he sent me a text the other day saying just diarrhea is astounding adjusted and now it's not a problem at all really just steak or eggs sometimes like this morning it was a steak yesterday morning at eight six eggs right now just what those down lunch I don't usually two meals a day right and then the second meals usually steak or a beefsteak he's died things I always picture my family looking at me while they're eating pasta eating like do you feel like an outlier at dinner with your family or not I am your wife not like come on I have ice cream with us no lost good amount of weight and then it just kind of like plateaued and I feel like I'd like to be you know like 10 lb lighter and it's working out I'm doing all that stuff but I feel like it needs something to shock my system to go to a nothing will shock your system like this carnivore diet including your butthole but you will lose a lot of weight I lost I mean I lost it illegitimate 12 pounds of fat just that my face got thinner show me my face I would feel better now because I went to Disneyland it was December 23rd and my family was in town and we had eating like pigs at the right is loaded considerably bloated with food as well as night time in the nighttime podcast podcast it really helps if you going to try to stick to something that like a real solid schedule360 rocktober lent no booze no pot no nothing cuz it takes I mean even if you are like writing if you said I'm going to write every day for the month of February you know every day there's something to that like a routine yes or something really beneficial I'm going to write for 1/2 an hour everyday if you do that things done if you decide for the next 30 days starting right now countdown on your calendar 30 days from now you will f****** lose weight you'll feel amazing yeah I eat all the time it seems like an extreme thing that I would not be willing to maintain well that's the thing for the Sultan of so that's why I want balance I'm always searching for the right balance I think a great move is 6 days on 1 day off that's what I think Six Days on a rigid diet a Hyundai where you you look forward to eating bread and pasta drinking whatever you want and it'll have an ice cream and one day write balanced I think a great move is 6 days on 1 day off that's what I think Six Days on a rigid diet a Hyundai where you you look forward to eating bread and pasta drinking whatever you want and it'll have an ice cream and one day</div>

Five things open the door for all of us all of us for me 100% where was it's a crime to where's it's a good plan for that most outrageous offences I got a podcast Infinity broadcast network alright Infinity dollars and $500,000 $600,000 December 18th 1992 and then August 12th 1993 $500,000 So within a year six months time even look 92 2004 time they got fired 1100000 dollars census where it's mostly language you know f*** man crazy I mean we think about this today in terms of like what we get away with him podcast total freedom freedom I think a lot of that was open the door was open because of Howard Stern was it say that it says a playing the piano with his penis recorded the crystal jewelry this wjkl JFK FM in Washington DC became the third Infinity station to are the Howard Stern Show in 1988 two months later and stole mail of New Jersey mistakenly tuner radio naked women in For an upcoming show she recorded the other f****** snitch Christmas party broadcast in December 16th that featured a man playing the piano with his penis choir singing about gay sex to the tune of white Christmas in women being hypnotized to achieve orgasm under the referral of her Senator this f****** crazy lady call the senator and Congressman stomel fire filed a complaint with transcripts and a tape of the program the FCC review the evidence and asked Infinity in October 1989 the nation has the material in quotes may have violated federal law by including indecent programming during daytime hours that's funny look at night time it's okay to get naughty karmazin argued that the term patently offensive in its new ruling was vague and the sexual references cited were no more offensive than daytime television shows Geraldo and Donohue which use similar terms without repercussions to or his wrist was later rejected that the FCC yeah so that they started fighting back then in 88 I would imagine that for terrestrial radio out of that still holds right look he's a different person do ya shouldn't have to do that old show you should do whatever he wants right that's who he is now right exactly now but I work for NPR do this life from here which is Prairie Home Companion and I do this thing on that show and they are said they have comedians on once in awhile and they have musician and they are really strict when when a comic is about to go out there he's told 20 times can't say it's like really really really strict and if you violated if you say the wrong thing they get a fine for every station that airs on throughout the network in the evening in the east coast it's so ridiculous it's and it's rated PG program onion on this is the way you want it cuz it's for kids and families and stuff like that but for the government to step in it's ridiculous you know I didn't do this for so long right I mean like before Howard Stern I realized there was no one there was no one like that there was Don Imus who was kind of controversial in some ways Stern who is it just a totally different animal yeah yeah he open the door for podcast for sure yeah all these outrageous people doing podcast he made the roadmap right yeah hundred percent will it show the other with you</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> what's exciting to me is that I think this is the first time in my life that I've ever seen so much communication on these subjects and I think so much recognition about the consequences of tribal toxic tribalism this tribal thinking that everyone seems to be engaged in on the right and on the left I mean in America you need to go no further than going back and forth from CNN to Fox News to say something's wrong here these supposed to be news outlets you have to come different narrative and that has nothing to do with what we're talking about gender politics and and radical left socialism and Marxism what you what you're seeing and universities though is a radical departure from what I always considered University's great for but I always considered universities great for is separating from your parents challenging belief systems and being engaged in the works of brilliant who you can compare all of their findings and their discoveries and and sit down and debate them in class and when I was a kid when I was in high school went to a very good High School Newton South High School in Newton Massachusetts and one of the things that they did is they put on a debate between a guy from the Moral Majority which was this right-wing Christian group that I'm not around anymore but there this was 1914 so 81 and Barney Frank who was the congressman is not one of the first openly gay guys in Congress and and you got to watch these two people in this Auditorium debate their points in this Moral Majority guy had this you know right wing Ronald Reagan sort of puke point of view and Barney Frank who's kind of crazy got busted in some male prostitute Scandal and the gay community and just Barney Frank took him apart was brilliant to watch but it was a real debate was fascinating and he got to see a mediocre mind versus a great mind and you got to see this little thing and then I was like wow this is and it was one of the things that's always attracted me about the the idea that two people with different viewpoints and get together in front of a neutral audience and these people can sort of decipher which way these people are thinking and why they think about is that isn't right with conflict that as that is the alternative is to separate as you pointed out into two camps that don't talk yes anything is the consequence of not talking is that you fight. That's the end game because the only way you can stop from fighting with other people is by negotiating with them one of the things that's also interesting a fair bit of your political preference is determined by your biological temperament is strongly influenced so if you're a creative type who's kind of disorderly then you're likely to be on the liberal-left end of the distribution and if you're a non creative type who's orderly and and especially if your orderly then you tend to be on the right wing in to fix and so and well why is that what why do those variations exist because some of the time your best strategy is to do what other people have done and shut the hell up and just do it run the algorithm right the pathways already laid clear it works stay in the damn right and move forward and when things are going right it's the right approach the problem is is that sometimes it's not the right approach because something is shifted it so something new has to emerge until then there's a bunch of people who are adapted to the new and those with the entrepreneurial and creative and that way because it's a very entrepreneurial it's a very entrepreneurial what would you call it geography and so they're going to lean to the left but they have to understand people have to understand that the left and the right need each other the Liberals and conservatives need each other liberal start companies conservatives run the and the problem with the concern they can only run in One Direction everything is stable like hire some conservatives cuz they'll maximize efficiency in the move down that track but if the track is no longer going in a good direction because something's changed the environment change while then you got to bring in the creative people and so we need each other and the only way that we can survive the fact that were different and the fact that we need each other is by continually talking if talk constantly it's like well how much of what we're doing should we preserve versus how much of what we're doing should we transform and the answer is we don't know because the environment keeps changing so what do we do about that we talked don't I was on a CBC Canadian Broadcasting Corporation interview a couple of days ago and they took me to task I tweeted out this this invitation to the boys to fill out this program that I developed called future authoring and it helps people make a plan for life identity politics essentially we're going to we're going to be our ethnicity highly demonized individual examples of racism and Nazism Pepe the Frog feels good frog frog and so I tweeted out that my said the boys seek your fortune and rescue yourself from the underworld use code Pepe for future authoring so it's free for one week so they had to figure out what it meant picture of Michigan jfrog behold that out and said well look aren't you aren't you like appealing to the radical right and I said well know what I'm doing I said look at these people are attracted by the radical right although they satirists and juvenile satirists in graffiti types and they're playing a weird to have helped you guy who you are as an individual cuz that's the way out of the ideological trap so I can that's the way obviously what's the way out of tribalism first the way out of tribalism is not to never join the tribe you actually have to join a tribe as you mature right because what happens is for failure in infant then you have your parents two to make a relationship with but then when you move from your parents you have your tribe you have your group maybe it's the music you listen to It's the gang you hang around with whatever you have to socialized into the tribe you have to cuz otherwise you stay a dependent infant okay but now you're socialized into the tribe was that where it is like no the next thing to do is differentiate yourself from the tribe will still knowing how to behave within the tribe will that's the called individualism and that's I think with the West got right you're more than your you have to be a member of a group because otherwise you're not socialized not good for anyone man you have to have Team loyalty okay but that isn't where you should stop you should take the next step and become a fully developed individual and see the problem with being just a group member is that the group is the problem with conservatism the group is a fixed entity it has its rules and its regulations and if you remember that's all you are but the group can go badly wrong so the group needs individuals to keep the group alive and revivify. So you have to become an individual so you can revivify the group that's the called that's the call in the west to do heroism essentially to Noble way of living is to develop yourself past your group identity so that you can reconfigure the game when that becomes necessary and I think that there's a very influential line of developmental psychology get to the individual level that's the solution to solution to tribalism but you have to accept responsibility to do that in this is what your future authoring program is basically all about me and it's it's a wonderful program it's in along with his book rules and guidelines for life I think that's one of the things that a lot of young people are lacking is a structure to how to go about establishing who they are in the world is that what I've noticed when I've been speaking publicly say over the last year-and-a-half because there's a hole in our culture where there should be a discussion about maturity truth and responsibility no one's talking with your life simultaneously you're taking care of the broader Community Personal success breeds success because if you're going to establish name why not established like a really good and that's a good one good for you that you would be happy to be alive you find your life meaningful so you don't get all bitter and resentful and cruel and hostile an idiot logically addled in like murderous and genocide old is like none of that you think real hard how would you have to configure your life so that despite its suffering and the malevolence that's part of it that you would regarded as worthwhile that's up to you to develop the vision then put a plan into practice and so when I talk to people about this most of my audiences are young man it's probably about 6:35 more but that's about what it is right now the holes are dead silent you could hear a pin drop because nobody said so clearly for like fifty years that almost all the meaning that you will need to get you through the hard times of your life is going to be a consequence of adopting responsibility not of Rights and impulsive action impulsive Freedom like fine rights yeah Freedom no problem even freedom to do impulsive things fine but that isn't where you go Find the meaning that keeps you sustained through the storms of life that's going to be you take care of yourself you take care of your intimate partner to take care of your damn family you don't run off to take care of your community you rescue the wisdom from the past you stand up straight and you be courageous despite the fact that life is tragic and painted by malevolent like that's the ancient wisdom that's what that is Birdman partner you take care of your damn family you don't run off to take care of your community you rescue the wisdom from the past you stand up straight and you be courageous despite the fact that life is tragic and tainted by malevolent like that's the ancient wisdom that's what that is</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> actually there's a set of books that let ladies out perfectly read Dostoyevsky wrote a book called the possessed or the devils and it's a it's a description of the initial breakdown of the Orthodox Christian Society in in Russia in the late 1800 and the rise of radical socialist ideas so it's sort of like the prodromal to the Russian Revolution to brilliant brilliant book and the personalities that are involved and then if you read after that Gulag archipelago where he details what he just doesn't that book is quite remarkable so he said looked over tens of millions of people killed from 1919 to 1959 in the Soviet Union and it as a consequence of internal repression and it's so Dreadful that words can't do it justice mean it's absolutely Dreadful what happened in the Soviet Union just for starters 6 million ukrainians died because of starvation all the food that the collective Farmers newly collectivized Farmers had produced which wasn't very much by the way was taken from them and brought to the city's so the farmer starve to death some children and all your grain had been shipped off to the cities and you thought well I'm not going to have my children starve to death in the field and I'm going to go on my hands and knees and I'm going to pick up the grains that are left over that the Harvesters didn't count get and I'm going to feed those to my kids punishable by death you were supposed to hand in those extra bits of green so that they could be shipped to the city as well that was just the beginning of the fun in the Soviet Union and what sort of medicine did was say look this wasn't a consequence of the Marxist system gone wrong this was a consequence of the Mark's assistant it was an inevitable consequence of the axioms of the Marxist system and any delays that out and it's you got it right and what is the price but what is the connection how much tyranny you have to impose in order to produce something like equality of outcome either the in Thomas Howells talked about this little bit what the people who are equality of outcome don't understand is that you have to cede so much power to the authorities to the government in order to ensure equality of outcome that a tyranny is inevitable and that's right this is also a big technical problem is like well what measure of outcome you know there's lots of outcomes like how happy are you how much pain are you in how healthy are you how much money do you have how much opportunity for movement forward do you have what's the width of your Social connections like what's the quality of your friendships do you have exposure to art and literature like you know you can multiply the number of dimensions of a valuation between people innumerable there's just all sorts of ways to classify people you going to get the equality of outcome on every one of those measures is like everyone going to have to be equally happy in the relationship and if not why not what why why stop with economic why stop with pay there's no place to stop so and that's it then that's a huge technical problem because there is no place to stop there will be no stopping like nobody else nobody can have anything that everyone else doesn't have it that's the ultimate outcome of equality of outcome what you think about what that would mean it's terrible what instantly you think do it well there's nothing but a tyrannical system couldn't post that have you ever debated in Marshall supporter of your debated someone who is pro equality of outcome know they don't debate me supposed to be friendlier I suppose but no I haven't because people don't do it they don't ask me to do it but what is it about that idea or that ideology about Marxism that's so attractive to Young students and to University Park Dennis upset that would be wise the left-wing attractive will the left-wing is necessary because inequality does spiral out of control and so there has to be a political voice for the dispossessed and you don't want people to stack up at zero and where they can't play the game at all it's a bad idea not only do you not if people stack up at zero they're too poor to get ahead at all let's say there to Port open a bank account there too poor to buy enough food like they're stuck at 0 and they can't get out of it it's a really bad seeing because that's a lot of suffering and that's not so good second of all well at least in principle a lot of those people might be what might have something to offer the world or their children might and you want to open up Avenues of opportunity to them so that they can succeed but so that everyone else can benefit from their success so and then the next thing is well if the inequality gets out of hand too much then the whole society starts to destabilize because if you get enough people stacked up a 0 special young man enough young men stocked up at zero they think the hell with it will just flip the whole board over and it'll settle in a new configuration and maybe we won't be stuck at 0 in the new configuration so it's foments revolutionary thinking who has lots of reasons to be concerned about inequality until you need a voice on the left to say look we got to parameterize the the tendency towards inequality so that it doesn't destabilize the entire Society so that it's everybody has an opportunity to advance right you need that chemical reason for the necessity of the left and then I think its attractive because well because young people can be resentful part because they're at the bottom of the Heap so to speak they're not cuz they're young like look you want to be you want to be pouring 18 you want to be rich and 80 which you going to choose doors are more in the United States are old but why is that well it's like you've had a lot more time to make money how would that be that's the explanation so that's one of the big drivers of inequalities just simply age but it's not obvious that the old rich people have an advantage over the Young starting out people so so anyways but anyhow maybe you're resentful and irritated cuz you're young and you still at the bottom of the people of your race or ethnicity or gender at least you think it is so you say well I want to make things fair and then that's also driven by some real compassion because nobody really likes that the consequences of radical inequality like nobody likes the fact that homeless people exist and have to go to the emergency Ward you know what to get treated and they don't have medical coverage and they have to live in tents on the street and so if you have some compassion then you think while we go to do more for the poor and dispossessed so I hey that's that's an understandable sentiment but the problem is is that the people but the problem is is that it's that that that desire to help is contaminated by resentment an idiot logical certainty and then also buy something that George Orwell pointed out so nicely in his book the typical middle-class socialist this was his diagnosis and he was a socialist by the way his diagnosis was the typical middle-class intellectual socialist doesn't like the poor they don't have anything to do with the poor they're contemptuous of the poor but they hate the rich and I think it's even more devious than that because I think who they hate are the successful some of the successful rich but really who they hate is too successful it's it's like Cain and Abel it's the retelling of Cain and Abel are some positive motivation for being engaged on the left and there's a lot of negative motivations as well and the people who are really driven by the radical left my resentment and hatred as far as I'm concerned let's look at both extremes so back to the idea of the of the ideological and verbal territory I said with Bill C 16 that I wouldn't speak the language of the radical leftist because I don't think that that language should Define the game but let's say it does so here's the game the world is a battleground of groups and they're battling for power that's it that's the game some of them win and they oppress those who don't with so that's how we're going to view the world okay now the left is say okay well here's the oppressed people the oppressors the patriarchy type patriarchal types they should be ashamed of themselves and give up some power the right-wingers the radical right Wingers look at that new say oh I see so the game is ethnic wear white males we're not going to lose that's the right wing version of identity pause it's like screw you if we're going to divide into groups before going to divided into tribes and I'm in my tribe I'm not going to get all guilty and lose I'm going to get all cruel and wind and that's like men you think while there's people in the middle of their kind of looking back and forth which side of the identity politics Spectrum I might get a fallen do I want to go with the do I want to go do I want to be driven primarily by compassion and I'm am I going to accept guilt for my historic privilege that's one possibility and then I'm the oppressor I'm a member of the oppressor group or am I going to say uno to hell with that I'm just going to play the wind well then I'm going to go to the right it's like why my sense is how about we don't play either those games and the reason we shouldn't play the mist or the Soviets play the left-wing game and my killed who knows how many tens of millions of people you can't even counted accurately the estimates range from 20 to 100 million was a pretty big are Bart and that in the modest maybe a hundred million Play 60 million so okay that didn't work out so well then there's the Nazis like they played ethnic identity politics and racial superiority like what we want to play that game see what I've been trying to do really what I've been trying to do for the last 30 years to say look there's heavy Temptations to play those sorts of games but that's not the only game in town too much better game to play individual so I can get your act together stand up in the world makes love yourself stay away from the theological oversimplifications set your house in order that's rule 6 in the in the Guinness book so I have a book rule in there says that your house in perfect order before you criticize the world and it's very dark chapter about the motivations of the Columbine High School killers and this other guy named Carl panzram who is a serial rapist in arsonist in murderer and he wrote an autobiography and why they did what they did their resentful to the core bitter bitter terrible and well I'm suggesting that people stay away from that resentment resentfulness and bitterness even though life is hard and it and is malevolence in the world like yeah you can you can tell a story where everyone's a victim because we all. We all get sick and and and and things happen to us that are bitter and terrible betrayal deceit lies like people hurt us on purpose of life malevolence as well as everyone's a victim you can tell that story the problem is if you tell that story you start to act it out you make all of that worse that's the problem and it's so this is why I partly I got attracted to Christian imagery at least in part because there's an ID in Christianity that you should pick up your goddamn cross and like walk up the hill and that's dramatically that's correct that's the right answer they're in a fair bit of it's going to be unjust what you going to do about it except it voluntarily and try to transform as a consequence that's the right answer the right answer because the rest of it is tribalism and we're too technologically powerful to get old tribal again</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> so Men's Health Magazine just haven't read this article called new year new dick with Marky Mark Wahlberg on the cover at appropriate fisticuffs so they have everything that a guy could do to enhance performance or increases as your Decker increase blood flow or increase orgasm quality or they just want to find out where everything from like freaking gas station dick pills to which by the way those things do not have in them what they say they have in them what do you think they have the so they see how they say like epimedium and you're welcome long Jack and Ryan this looks like my head was going to explode I mean it's it's like drinking 10 cups of coffee yeah we have a friend of ours who predicted accurately that Jon Jones was taking those things when he pissed hot he was like those things have everything in them and he goes I can't he's taking dick pills that actually pretty entertaining to read ounces of ingredients did you actually get it tested no no we went to all these Labs it wouldn't let us actually test but apparently the FDA has tested them if you go to fda.gov website they have Like These Warnings out about the actual words we took that they had warnings about and tested them in the head in the morning fill completely screwed up like all day morning it's like you just mainlining coffee so they did that they did on that have you heard of this like Acoustic sound wave therapy for your deck I'm serious my balls might I got his went everywhere cuz I don't really know what they were what they were going to do and I wanted I wanted it all all Shields activated and lay down and and so my legs are split I'm on this exam room table and this gal comes in and she's got like this giant wand attached to a machine and they do this for women too by the way they feel like a condom on the end of it and then she just basically goes to town for like 20 minutes like a jackhammer around 20 minutes or supposedly supposedly breaks open old blood vessels and builds new blood vessels and once the numbing cream wears off your supposed to perform a lot better and then they combine this y'all we're we're talking about like with your shoulder if you inject it you should do like Electro stammer vibration or something to to get the injection deeper into the tissue thought I don't know why I thought they put the needle just like right in the pee hole which it to me made sense but out but doesn't really I mean you want it natural to actually actually go like up where the dick attached is like the tissue at the top I do to nerve blocks on either side and in the PRP and later on like a couple months and you literally just get boners all the time like all night long for like a month so the acoustic sound therapy supposed to be breaking up blood vessel rakes open old looks like at like an old hunched over man then all the sudden bigger it looks like a bodybuilding everything iced tea bodybuilding so is that horrible sport do you think it's real do you think that's really doing work for me at work for me in the gas station dick pills into the acoustic sound wave therapy so I went down to Florida and Florida I don't know what it I think it's cuz all the old people live in Florida Fort Lauderdale the stem-cell thing was that the u.s. stem cell clinic in Florida and I went in there and they extract all the fat for me that they took the fat on my back and what they do is they they have is called an enzymatic process where they use something that breaks down the collagen in the fat and then they have the stem cells that get separated from the fat and apparently it's very very high in these angiogenic like like vascular or vessel building compounds and so then you get that re-injected Italian The Miz on the MSC switch are supposedly the very good ones did it to inject in so I injected those or I had it a doctor info cancel a shipment of Spokane on ice and they show up at my house at like 7 a.m. right cuz he got to get them delivered same day and then I have my appointment at the doctor at 9 a.m. and I went to the doctor and there is like deja vu from Florida where I can go and do that do the numbing the crazy pictures in the magazines infrared light of my balls and this big thing called the Juve light that they had me standing in front of every day like a Jack and he injected these these stem cells from my fat after they grown for like several for in this case I think they were down there for like 8 weeks but I mean they can do same-day injection but for me I didn't have enough at this for me is right in the middle of irate professionally and also course racing so I'm just like lean as hell if I go in there so they could they could barely get enough fast they too grown for a longer. Of time. Times they can inject same day so I went into Spokane at this clinic in Spokane Valley new integrative Clinic like this Osteopathic Medical Clinic with all these nice receptionist when you walk in the door and this this this doctor who he's done stem cell injections before but never actually injected into someone's dick so it's kind of like the do you have to explain to him what areas you're supposed to eat it and I think he actually talked beforehand to make sure that they were on that on the same page, FlyAway back down to Florida this is like all black and blue or the injector cleaner was yeah it could have gotten infected I could have had MRSA and I would not wish MRSA on your dick 91.1 I got it this was at though at The Wildflower Triathlon like coming back my flight got delayed and I was covering all these kids like an off-road Triathlon and had all these scrapes and wounds and I think I think my layover was in Vegas I don't remember where but I had to check in the hotel if I got too late and I slept in this hotel room that I swear like there must have been something on the bed cuz it's been a few days like they was all you don't get all nasty and Cakey and then it was eating a whole I wrote a whole blog post about this on my website and that you can buy I'm on it as soon as soon as they come back in the door I died having to go into the shower upstairs and defense open Roth hunt yet they have a bunch of different wipes and stuff for people that trained a shower yeah you got to be careful it is like the stories like these for Steve's that apparently traveled around the world and they would Rob Holmes and and they never got sick like that's basically the story I'm sure this was this was some board table at a multi-level marketing essential oils complete somebody came up with this story could be true I don't know but the dick that was an interesting but it did I think from what I can tell looking in the mirror Coptic I'm pretty sure how much so happens I like maybe that much later and like enough to tell and my Russians got bigger and I orgasmed a lot better for how long they'd there still like that and I was doing the the hundred reps in 5 minutes snatch test with it with a one-and-a-half food and I felt something just go I was at 80 and I felt something go in my back and I got some cells injected all up and down my ql my multifidus my erector spinae into my soul ass but then they also sent them to me to my house and I did that same that sell the stuff that's rich in the mesenchymal stem cells into the bloodstream so I did a push IV into the bloodstream that's the one that you would have to go out of the country to Jen normally you're not supposed to do that like that technically not legal for someone to inject with your own stem cells into your bloodstream but if you get your stem cells extracted and they're stored and they send them to you you can technically inject them if you do it yourself or you like have a friend who's a nurse or whatever we we caught it on video for Men's Health films so they'll publish a video some point but I was super nervous cuz like a few thousand dollars worth of stem cells that I'm trying to hit the vein and make sure that they go in the right way and then inject it's a very very small amount I was kind of nervous I do a lot of that I don't think that's the worst photo the worst one of them and it's like flesh eating bacteria but it's like a weird pressure from dry needling this is like that accept pain right like it's both the pain and the price was horrible horrible like a small golf balls instaff he had open holes we could see his muscle structure under his armpit was horrific gosh he would any he never really recovered he wanted he died he died young from that who knows what he died from but look at the whole I think I still have it on my gosh he didn't read it quickly now for a I don't know if it was just really aggressive but real common thing in gyms and what you get it it stays with you like I said he's your bloodstream like I still like I have an essential oil diffuser on my desk and I put thieves in everyday and I just diffuse essential oils infrared light and this is that and they've done these studies on testicular and sperm production and they found that there's a wavelength that's like 600 800 nanometers wavelength of light that if you expose the testicles to that 452 20 minutes a day specialist concept of photo bio modulation so I originally got into this whole photo bio modulation thing in this company do I block people just send me these weird things to my doorstep to try and they sent me this like nasal Pro they put up your nose and it's got like that helmet on it you could you can look it up Jamie if you want to call the violet light and it produces this light that supposedly activates a part of your medic say I like your electron transport chain in mitochondria and is a part of that called the cytochrome C oxidase and apparently activates more activity in the cytochrome C oxidase you produce more ATP in General tissue could you have it on your head and they were using this in dementia and Alzheimer's patients but it turns out it's almost like a like a nootropic for your head yes that's me at my desk back back when I was a young Chinese woman Colts antenna and what's it was I think it was NPR it was out of Radiolab or Taylor science one of them but I think they might be ready like they did a study on light or a or a story on like this tend to 40 hertz frequency photobiomodulation putting this thing of the probe in my ear and you're not even supposed to use it too much because it produces so much ATP that if you amp Up Cellular activity in neural tissue too much you produce too many reactive oxygen species like that's a byproduct of cellular metabolism it just like if you eat too much you produce a lot of byproduct of making energy and that's why it's one of the reasons why fasting is good for you send contact with this you won't use it all the time cuz you get too much activity you produce too many free radicals are too many reactive oxygen species but every other day use it so in this is for my head and it ended this like couple years ago the same thing every time I wake up nitric oxide but if you do it on your testicle specifically the cell that works on his the latex cells in the testes which responsible for producing testosterone so you're basically stimulating the leydig cells in the testes the same way that you stimulate like neural tissue using this one for your head so I had success with the thing for my head so I tried this one for the balls in the deck and what I did was I would just Jack my pants down for 5 to 20 minutes a day while using my Essential Oils you actually get more blood flow I mean I didn't do a control study to pull my pants down and standing there for 20 minutes. That without the light on I should I should do that at some point maybe it's just like the whole units like and supposedly going combat-style supposed to be good for your dick to you obviously I'm not naked but normally I would I would I would be nude and yeah ready better size better orgasms men like like all this stuff seemed to have a so all this time so I would not repeat</div>

The new fault line it not next against right if people believe in in Liberty for the individual peebly want more authority to control you in that that's the real conflict well if the right really wanted to bring more people over what they would do is establish like universally across-the-board and appreciation for gay people appreciation for gay marriage and appreciation for the need to taking poppers communities and bring them up an appreciation for welfare and appreciation for you know raising the minimum wage has started a few things like that good Lord the amount of people that would jump off that f****** ship that's sinking ship of liberal ideas yeah because it's just it's infested with rats it's infested with rats that are chewing the hole in the very Hollow the ship that happened in the UK what is quite conservative government out of your life yeah it should be maybe that's what they need to do but I can definitely if you if you support the left you need to try and dissuade the Democrats and the and the Labour party from coming work because they alienate all of that made you a third party country previously historically is that when someone charismatic came along that's an independent they really just take votes away from the Democrats yet so you took votes away from the Republican and that's why Bill Clinton gotten off a Herbert Walker Bush was in his first term so we only did one term and then Bill Clinton one and Herbert Walker Bush was going for real NY run but he one rather is cuz Ross Perot who is this eccentric billionaire do you remember him and bought an entire half hour of prime-time Television to show people how they're getting f***** by the Federal Reserve and taxes and is explained Bravo Department of pretty sure I remember you worried about the long ago and Bernie Sanders giant different there's some it alot of it is people are concerned with abortion rights as a giant one and people are concerned with a republican putting someone in the Supreme Court that is going to limit a woman's right to choose that's so if you get to a position where you are Republican much have to be pro-life right if you want want the group to the sticking point is that you're killing a baby I'll be like Electro Hemlock and I think it will just absolutely not work but he is they don't see that how did I not see it because they're full of s*** normal they're not they're not acting normal seemed genuine there's certain aspects of people that it's hard to tell but there's some people just don't seem genuine and political people in particular like when people are running for political office that's when that s*** really stands out as over and over and over again you see them doing the speeches and over and over and over again you see them talking about things and some people can sense it and some people can't but they can't tell when you're a liar you can't tell other people see you right because you're lying like I know a guy I'm going to be nice here never he's gay as f*** but he doesn't think everybody knows it he's some point right he's gay or everyone that I know knows he's gay we all wish you know but he's got a family wife and kids were all speculating sexual I'm pretty sure I mean if I had a bad I'm f****** pushing all my chips because of that he acts in this really strange because he's living this tile live a life he acting strange when I don't think he realizes that people know and you think a lot of these people going into politics a lot of that kind of sociopathic 10000 people if you're talkin to 10,000 people about the way we can come together as a country and we can take America back yeah there's no connected I always put that down to them having to follow up on T line or the sloganizer you know that drink slogans if someone's awoke politician unless that's who they really are whenever he sort of brings people into no mind to the line by folks is on Arc and folks in there cuz it means that you start thinking Democrat is woke and we know it just never I need by the poverty line in Mobility for people that are not social justice issues yeah not nonsense</div>

Realm of existence even possibly think for a second maybe a little bit wrong and that to me is a horrible how you challenge. You can't just like you can't challenge someone who's a believer in the Westboro Baptist yeah she really does want to walk around those godhatesfags but I find that really if he was truly pure I would have said it would have kept him alive and he was probably thinking about homos who knows hateful hateful funeral and these guys are standing in front of the building where you're having a service and they're saying the reason why your son dies cuz there's a bunch of people out there that are in love with other men having sex with men and so this is the reason why they going to hold up these giant placards is horrible setting when you see that sort of thing but then when I get to decide to go people allowed to protest right it's like everything else in human nature to messy and those woke people need to understand that's messy to yeah life is messy you can't you can't get 100% compliance from people and if you want that you're a bully you know you're being mean you can't they're not going to do it and you're not right you're not right it's best you definitely not right if you're not willing to debate people on this if you're right that's why Obama was saying was it when you said that people aren't perfect thing to say that was the answer is that their parents didn't have I see signs though that the younger generation to generation Zed was the you'd say something like that I'll reacting against the millennial generation in this Biz there is.

Jenny she's screenshot the thing put it on Twitter made you think of it and he had to step down so I think that's the difference is where is like saying some of that cooling out a mistake according to maps that you perceive to be bad that's all well and good but when you're using it to advertise how virtuous you are and how you you're able to take someone down for the mistake that they made. Troubles me cuz then it's no longer about radio well I think we were dealing with when when when you're talking about woke culture and I love that you made this comparison to radical religious cuz I think they're the same patterns I think human beings have patterns that they follow and you could say that you're not religious but you follow these extremely rigid ideology that don't allow for any variation whatsoever you think they forced 100% compliance and if you're not one Bank compliance and if you're not one hundred percent in compliant they will attack you and you can't be woken up one of things you find a religion is people will especially in the more radical dangerous and scary religion so that her and on each other</div>

Mentioning a few comics and it was so obviously I hope since he's stupid and I made up a name and I sent it and they were really loving it I like published it's still online and what's even worse is that your name and the headline is something like it's meant to be comedy if you set that you'll come up hate speech or how many of these online fake names at discussing drug screening back into industry and if you take the fourth letter of every sentence it's spelled out to Tony McGrath wrote this you gullible hacks I need the main thing it's amazing that you were able to encode that what it was a sure thing if they agreed with the sentiments so they posted in their paper you just be a random random random random person sends it in and they like brilliant degree and they put it in the National Paper independent do you know f****** because I actually think raise your standards you know beating us this this ideological b******* I think there's an issue to with online journalism that these people are basically fighting for their own Survival there's a real engagement have to kind of give into certain amount of Madness it's not the person that's the same reason why the most extreme ideas on Twitter get more retweets I get rewarded that they would like some it's like that shouldn't have a real old-fashioned headline women are evil in you know stuff like BuzzFeed does it but when it comes to a reputable Publications like the New York Times And The Washington Post why are they pushing this so you think it's just about money to generate clicks and clicks is what generates income and I think there's a real issue if you I know guys were journalists and women as well who will tell you that if they're articles do not get a certain amount of Engagement yeah they're in trouble and now they can't check how things that everything has to be something that is engaging it has to be it has to be attractive but either way encourages people to be upset about things because it shows you a lot of things that you engage with and a lot of times people tend to engage with things that they're upset by so whether it's abortion or second amendment or whatever the subject is if you have an engaging with that and you respond a lot he said that's what they're going to show you over and over and over again and it's really more of a symptom of what human beings are attracted to a lot of time you were attracted to things that upset us but that's going to spinal further and further out of control I mean to be a logical yeah I know that I'm so I'm so against censorship and you know I really am but I want I want journalists and commentators have high standards and was just being honest first and foremost and I have integrity and they weren't just have two clicks and then half of this stuff would go away I feel some of it would go away my question is they weren't doing this 15 years ago no so what will they be doing 15 years from now well this we're out with his dry up that's the question isn't all we can to reach a Tipping Point right that's the question right because every time I think we're nearly at the Tipping Point they double down and it got worse right so you know after Trump's election for instance write it almost immediately you have the women's March and I didn't really know what that was about like it was it was it was some people are Marching for feminism some people Marching for environmental issues some people ready in Cudahy what are you protesting in are you saying that you had found the saying not my president right so they protesting against democracy than in the UK when when we just had our general election is a big March would like to be defined as a note my prime minister for something right so I think what do you like about listen that in the future there going to be a combined force and they going to make sure that this doesn't happen again I think is a better way to do it without generating so much resentment. I think I think it's a more sophisticated approach which is to say that democracy sustained on the principle of the losses consent with any any democracy is going to have a substantial proportion of the population did not vote for the leader that picture and you have to have that and the best way to is true persuasion and sensible discussion and choose I'm not dressing up as a vagina ya no I agree with you in many ways but I also think for them is also fun to get together with a bunch of other like-minded people and you know and then there's the the men who joined in hey girls on with you vagina. Just mind ya know I agree with you in many ways but I also think for them is also fun to get together with a bunch of other like-minded people and you know and then there's the men who joined in hey girls on with you</div>

This is weird interpretation of historical events even mammals breathe and dissertations dolphins whales and so on and chimps A&amp;R they feel these mothers are just just to Preston and almost suicidal when their infants die that's different from you know conceiving of like what I know I'm going to die cuz I see people around me going to die that I can get to conceive a maybe some other place to go so I start off as a paradox that if I asked you to imagine yourself dead you can't do it because to imagine anything you have to be alive be like falling asleep and waking up the next morning because you have dreams or whatever it's going to be more like general anesthesia where it's you know 10 9 8 boom boom lights out and you can but you just never wake up so and we talked about things like well there's nothing after death but but even the word no thing implies there's a thing or maybe you're going to this place this nother there's nothing with no thing or nowhere implies that there's aware that you're not going to but there's not even aware you're not going to and it's like you know with Lawrence Krauss and some of these cosmologists you know what's what was there before the Big Bang so what he said well Maginot Universe you don't know stars or planets are galaxies no light but does not even any space or time and at some point you just we don't have the words to even say what it is worth trying to talk about there's there's nothing before the Big Bang can't even actually talked about it well don't they think now though that it's entirely possible that the Big Bang I think something like that I think that fans and contracts infinitely forever yet that that's a preferable that it is well that he can't wait to come up with some way to talk about it so we also have this weird biological idea based on our own limitations that there's a birth and a death of everything right he's been and at times in the past either misleading or misled yes sometimes that's right you know some of his recommendations for dietary things or whatever perhaps but I know for sure cuz I got to know him pretty well that he totally believe the stuff he says it sounds like we was I used to call it if you interpret it from a position he says your Consciousness is the ground of all being it's the ontological Primitive these things that sound nonsensical but if you think about it from a simple perspective the entire universe is in your brain and when you cease to exist the universe ceases to exist or you but you're in your brain Consciousness definition into existence material stuff by thinking about observing into whatever and here's some quantum physics experiments that a really spooky a timeout Nina quantum physics this weird is Buche Consciousness is weird and spooky that doesn't mean they're connected he thinks they are guided meditation thing and all the massages and tees in the food and all that stuff and it's Resort in Carlsbad feeling better like yeah this stuff works where it where is Carlsbad Encinitas North San Diego what do you mean by I had an experience and we got to do better than that for science so what Deepak and Ryder talking about is that is that the Western version of Buddhism actually work medically may get a lower stress hormones in your body the lower blood pressure these kinds of things that are measurable cuz that's what we want to know from the Western Scientific perspective not to do I feel better but 67% of the people who did this particular treatment they got better by these measurable criteria for nothing that we can't even we can't even wrap our head around nothing because we would think of a thing that there's nothing but there's never a thing right right or why why don't we just say we don't know why don't we speculate on the possibility of Consciousness being some sort of ethereal thing or something that exists outside of the Bible we don't know we really don't doubt I conclude in the end of the day I don't know and there's an afterlife or not and that very end of the book we can come back to this later I just said it doesn't really matter whether there's an afterlife or not cuz we don't live in the afterlight we live in this life so this is the time you got to do whatever you got to do I call this Aldi's error Aldi's I'll be singer Woody Allen's character in Annie Hall scene in the movie where he is a flashback is a young boy and his season this psychiatrist offices with his mom and then what's the problem why won't you do your homework lb says the universe is expanding because the universe is expanding as the universe is everything there is and if it's expanding one day it's all going to blow apart so nothing really matters I'm not going to do my homework in Brooklyn Brooklyn is not expanding fascinating things to contemplate But ultimately really for practicality sake you really should be paying attention to life totally empty space and the quantum physicist super positions like particle subatomic particles being super position where they're in a state of moving and not moving at the same time explain that away that completely fuk my head up to like okay well that is this even though I don't understand he's like no it's not even that okay so but I understand it anyway that it doesn't really matter because the atoms are jiggling in a way that this is solid you could sell it sell it in this is the level we live at the wrong way to think about it Consciousness when you die you return to the conscious that you were before you were in before you're born so so the physical body is just an instantiation of this conscious thing whatever decision and I don't know I'd be surprised but I'll be pleasantly surprised if it turns out I close my eyes for the last time and I wake up and my friends this isn't hell if that's true I'm not against any of this just like I'm not against Ray Kurzweil in these guys figuring out that we can live 200 years or 300 is great if you can do it you know but let's just when they say to make sure where do you want to live to be 500 is like just give me the 80 with prostate cancer and if it turns out you we lived on 5200 then we have a bunch of other problems we don't even know about yet okay I think there's some beauty in temporary things that we've for whatever reason we're we are voiding. Concept we were terrified of things ending spytec will Christopher Hitchens in my book today love is analogy first of all you're at the party and then death Taps you on the shoulder since you have to leave and worse the party's going to go on without you and they're going to have fun as I do know but you can never leave the party of what heaven is like a guy with a harp I will harp and there's a bunch of babies with wings like what they're even a decide that they said that's why it's called it the celestial North Korea you have a dictator that knows all of your thoughts and everything you're going to do is wait a minute that that does not sound like fun to me</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> call nice, I'm not worried about my friend of it like cuz I like the people so much I've met and Bob would have never met anybody about me why didn't like yeah they're nice people write all of my nice people and none of them are dicks nothing to give that energy off like they all know they could strangle me like there's nobody makes you feel that way but that's why I got like Matt Serra is such a good guy cuz he's got such a good character you know and that you can kind of noticed that from a lot of Fighters right they have great character and when the reason why they have great character is there they don't have a problem with their ego they're controlled they are now do they are they feel good never uncomfortable around any of them like never for that reason at least no matter who they are or what position are in the other what kind of the same nothing come off like with that Alpha energy to other athletes give you have everybody choke you I used to do that yet that they're all pretty gentle state or put me in a f****** Goodwin didn't yeah yeah his hurt he put me he shouldn't kick me across the way it hurts so bad no but I'm being honest I think you did it like Neiman 50% not even close that was a probably wasn't even 30% all that was like the weight of his leg. He could have really f****** leveled me oh my God Owen Spader got you in an arm lock Google video series are you getting beat up by UFC fighter Seattle horrible fighting but I also know that they could I just trust him for some reason I trust him to be gentle I don't know why people choke to underarm Barbie I had some really fun was that I wish I had done more of these because it was really a bit done out of respect for what they do but I just to feel what it's like to watch someone who's world-class in one of the best alive and doing that and it was said to have them do it to you felt like f*** man this is how good this guy isn't this how did you get the gig with UFC how'd that work events in whatever and I just got a phone call one day he's like I hate doing a podcast with my starter won't do it just called me and goes here's the money do you want do the podcast it was a phone call from Dana podcast she didn't Matt was already in place and I said yeah I would love to so we worked out a couple of things at my job where I was able to do something else with my name on it and he just hire me of course I buy play quality I like Jiu-Jitsu so beautifully and that's not what I do ya know it's it's interesting that the UFC even has a podcast you know yeah UFC unfiltered yeah but I think he just wanted a different tone to it</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> do it once a week twice a week twice a week I see Matt every Monday and Wednesday really and you meet in the city of the studio Nina City in the studio and they will be a lot of Fighters On Studio lot of times are Skyping it sucks I prefer in studio every time I've only done a couple of skype's to accidentally Snowden and John Anthony West who is my favorite guest ever he's an egyptologist to his incredible standing of Egypt in the hieroglyphs and he had this great DVD series called magical Egypt just he just passed recently amazing guy but him and just cuz he was sick and couldn't connect in here and then Snowden obviously because he's on the moon beanie just driving going to do something and you're the wind in each of you could get anything done with the weird thing about the Snowden one to was wasn't just that it was remote was also like what we were talking about like who he is and what would his situation is he's trapped in Russia allegedly I mean you might be in Cleveland with a story is but that he's you know got this situation where he's never going to really be able to come back to United States unless they you know work out some sort of a deal and even then he's not going to believe them you know I mean I wouldn't believe them I would neither did he say no about UFOs though they didn't you ask him what he said they hadn't seen evidence unseen evidence but how much do you look into and how much was available to him and you know where where is that kind of evidence if there is any of that stuff I don't know I don't believe in UFOs when the New York Times had that thing where they were talking about all the different reported UFO sightings that are reputable from people like David fravor and you know these Air Force guys that are like otherwise rock-solid individuals who talk about their experiences but my problem with it might legitimate problem me as a human beings I want it to be real so when people don't think it's really, that's all bulshit I'm like it's real like I'm not I'm not objective unbiased like legitimately biased and I know it might come on man wife why so biased about this so it's a weird one like I wanted to be real so much like talking to Bob Lazar like God I hope he's telling the truth that what what the greys are and this is something I've personally thought I think independently was that if you look at human beings and you look at say a gorilla right look at a gorilla was this big hairy f****** animal thing and then you slowly turn that into I guess we can really come from Gorillaz we came from Champs books Champs you know monkeys lower hominids Australia pithecus you know and then you know ancient man right and then all these different versions of what we are until we become right now Homosapien 2020 well what are we how do we look different well unless you're someone works out alot you losing a lot of your musculature you're not as dense that you're not is Harry you know when you see like that f****** killer wrestler from Russia and when we showed videos of that dude goddamnit remember his name rooster f*** GF he's this f****** tank of a man that's covered in hair but he looks like someone from the past and only throwing people around his f****** giant hairy back and hair all over his chest and arms this is that guy but that. Almost normal human there but there's some some videos of him when he's grappling that one right there double Flex the red one read about that another time another time is just here might we're talking about aliens and I was saying if you look at people like that like real Harry f****** testosterone-filled Savages like this guy was an elite wrestler he's a killer Grappler and then you look at aliens well if you look at Champs to that guy to aliens what's happening what's happening we're getting less High I'm getting smaller and weaker right we're getting more and more like when an alien looks like an alien have no genitals there's no mouse that just as smooth skinny thing with his big head and his big weird I like when we get rid of the need if we evolved past the need for physical strength and we evolved past the need for you know sex if sex is the note we don't reproduce any longer through just normal by logical male female sex if they a million years are now a hundred thousand years now we might decide that one of the biggest problems that face is human beings on Earth is our emotions are our desire for sex biology all of our animal instincts that we still hold onto and we could have all passed those just like we're so much different than chimps are we're so much different than we used to be when we were lower hominid we've evolved we evolved to the point where we're communicating with words we use phone before I am planes we have technology but also our bodies are softer and our bodies are unless this did not as strong the knot is animalistic and explosive and if he continues along that path especially aided by technology when we don't have any need which of these big ass giant brains and we can use telepathy to communicate with you communicate through some other way maybe even electronically enhanced maybe you know something in their brain but when you look at an alien the big head and little tiny body that's what a person is probably going to become our heads are way bigger our brains are bigger than other hominids and other primates our bodies are softer and weaker and if you just keep going with that that's what happens ahead what do they have no genitals it could be that human beings become some sort of cybernetic some sort of cyborg if you think about body parts right like we start replacing body parts like I met a gentleman the other day I did this benefit pulled the guy what it what is the guy's name the Australian gentleman who was the soldier who lost both his arm and his leg in a shark attack I did a benefit the other day with him for the Australian while he's going to carbon fiber are matte carbon fiber legs crazy shakes your hand grips it was carbon fiber hand and you know right now you can tell the difference between his carbon fiber hand this electronic and and his other hand but maybe a hundred years now you won't be able to do and maybe in the future it's better to have one of these artificial bodies then it is to have a biological body that can break and get all f***** up and you feel pain we're replacing things all the time we're replacing body parts all the with operations and we use organic substitutes Paul De gelder benefit with Jim Jefferies and Monty Franklin and Whitney Cummings have the night for the Australian Wildfire for wildlife relief they wants a billion animals then maybe you'll get to the point where they'll have limbs that are better than the winds we have like what biological limbs upgrade alien body you know I want to believe do. You know I want I saw the Lazar documentary you had a man I enjoyed I didn't see the whole interview but I saw I liked a lot I just I just always that one place with conspiracy that there's always a gap I cannot cross course and tomatoes the degrees I just can't get beyond the degrees being gone but rather believe in UFOs well he's clearly educated and he guy up says he work for Los Alamos labs and they sent him to MIT to work on top secret project there's clear evidence he worked at Los Alamos lab actually do me a favor go to Jeremy to go to Jeremy's I think it's on his Instagram page he has this thing it might be on a Twitter he has this thing where he has George Knapp explain all the different things he went through to prove the Bob Lazar was legit one of them being that definitely worked at Los Alamos he was even in the employee registry even though they said he didn't yeah play that give me some volume does central question for me about Bob was did he work at Los Alamos lap if he work there on classified projects it is plausible that he could work at Area 51 at Papoose Lake on other stuff did he work there I can tell you flat out he did a hundred percent certain that he did I found his name of the phone book I found his name in an article Los Alamos newspaper I talk to people who were there and finally Bob took me there they took me into the lab waved at the security guys we brought a camera along this guy was familiar was like a rabbit running through a burrow that he had traveled everyday and he's waving his Security Guys and walking into all these buildings he knew his way around he'd been there before they knew him they let him in they let me in have any record we can't find anything they'd already told me they had the records as soon as I think I'm getting close they yanked the rug out from under me he took lie detector test he passed all of them I know that doesn't mean anything but this were talking about the 1980s they get away with a lot back then in terms of erasing your history and his his education is undeniable in terms of what he knows he's at he's a brilliant guy when you talk to him he's not faking anything he's not like he doesn't have any holes in his understanding and knowledge always telling the truth but again I'm not I'm not objective unbiased I want to believe I want to believe as well I can't get beyond the school things that's Dynamite into me that says he's not being truthful of MIT thing I'll tell you this he told me that they sent him from Los Alamos labs to there to work on something and I'll tell you what it is off air but I told him I wouldn't I wouldn't talk about it during the podcast cuz you're going to hear when I tell you going to go ho Lee fuk and I'll make a little more sense it's I don't know you know it's again I'm a f****** loser I wanted to be real so I'm not looking at it yeah I'm not your very biased menu care anymore like even the the the three naval videos high bun with whatever a pilot C7 that Tic Tac video but now that there's something that they're saying it's making me go that might be man-made because they're saying something about if we were to reveal this it would compromise National Security no no they can reveal all the files they have on these UFO incidents it would compromise National Security First of all because it'll compromise their If he if they reveal how they know that something is blocking radar that object whatever it was actively jamming radar I had Commander fravor the guy who died on that thing the guy who was there and who reported that thing I had him here he said that thing went from 60000 feet down to 200 in less than a second there's nothing we have another now he said that the thing moves so fast it made this this travel in this radar you know radar is a blip rise like between one blip to another it it moved in a Preposterous speed you could even track it it was it was moving so fast they don't know if it did it in less than a second or we did in one second but whatever it was the amount of distance that have traveled is impossible do they have the laws of physics as we understand could they see it could they see with the naked eye as well yes yes you can see the video you can see the thing on video you can see the thing on video move off you can see that it's actively jamming radar you can see that they're they're trying to track it and stay with it but it's moving too fast that might be man-made and I figured it was something to do with compromising National Security I whatever the quote wise I was like that sounds like something that is man-made they're worried they'll compromised someone made okay if it's not man then it's something from another planet maybe this man-made maybe it is some project that the government has but whatever it is it's something that moves at an insane speed that we're not capable of understanding is in terms of what what the average person understands propulsion and engines and combustion all those people will pilot see One Pilots a stuff I listen to it because they understand those thing I don't like for me I don't know how things are supposed to move but they do play something that's what got me interested was in the times did the article on those so I really started going like I started watching &amp; Reading like I want to believe I just can't find anything that doesn't have a gap that I can't cross well you should talk to Forever he's a f****** rock-solid guy he's very it's very compelling me to talk to me in person because he doesn't have anything to do with publicity is not interested at all he wanted to tell his story because he felt like they're not being honest about it and that people really should know that there's some things that we don't understand and that these guys that are down in San Diego that we're at the Air Force Base they were seeing these things like fairly recently before his his experience they had seen one like four in the last couple weeks I think it was and then they find them on the east coast to the same thing and they move in the same way that Bob Lazar described these things that he worked on area S4 the same way where there's something called Element 115 that Bob Lazar described in the late 80s early 90 didn't even know it was real until 2013 he was describing it long before it was ever proven to be an actual thing long before they were created with a particle accelerator this is my head again Basin is only an opinion have no facts to this when I listen to him he was my first thought was after these things that don't line up while he took somebody story what he's saying is somehow true but he's telling somebody else's story and maybe a total Bly that was my head told me was cuz he knows so much and yet have they make your education disappear like I want the 1980s quickly but I want it to be true like I want people to go out Kanye West in my f****** my class I don't think I talked about it on the podcast where he went back and found these guys that he worked at the lab with he worked at Los Alamos lab for sure and he worked on top secret nuclear projects and he worked in propulsion and that's one of the reasons why they sent him to this area as for because he put a jet engine in a Honda in the 1980s and you know intent understanding of combustion engines and propulsion all these different things that he's creating and so like let's see if this guy can crack this crazy night and so they were just bringing scientist to try to get a different perspective on these crafts and the one that he was working on or one of them that he's working on they said they had found in the archaeological dig that's where it gets really crazy like they found this thing what he was working on they think would he read was that what the government was telling them when they're working there when they were briefing him was that human beings are the product of science projects that human beings were created when many many thousands of years ago hundreds whatever millions of years ago however long it was aliens came down here and did experiments with lower hominids they did experiments with primates and added their DNA and manipulated the DNA to create human beings Bob Lazar crushing it's not that I don't know enough about it to convince you otherwise I but I just don't but I'm kind of hoping you can convince me if they made the school records disappear but why do they leave the records that we just saw from that place didn't know they were there that that somebody had a copy of the the the registry for that that place someone who work there during the same time he did how to copy the registry do they didn't just eliminate is eliminated social security number eliminate a lot of s*** in the 1980s that can make you effectively disappear yeah I'm sure they can I mean the NBA is Paper Trails for a little bit different but it's just I can't get beyond the 2° and I'll I get I want I want to I'm sure I've heard him interviewed he's a very compelling guy when I'm at the degrees or not hard that's not hard to get past that's not hard to to eliminate what's hard is understanding all the things he understands when it comes to science education the way he talks about it have you ever seen the videos where he's describing it in a late 80s it's exactly the same as he describes it now exactly the same no variation whatsoever that kind of story 40 years ago and then I ask you again today to tell me that same story most bullshitters are going to have some holes in that store and change it and doesn't mean he's telling the truth but he's been insanely consistent I would almost think even a truth-teller will make mistakes never timed up if it's a if it's a store that I've created I think I'm less likely to forget details if I created it because I have a beginning middle and end to it right but it's very complicated when he sang is very complicated in the descriptions of them with descriptions of these crafts and the way the propulsion system works and the fact that it uses this incredibly dense element that doesn't even exist on Earth and you know 1989 or whatever it was but now they found actual real thing like that element 115 that was people saying that science fiction you're making things up but now that they have created in particle accelerator so I call it is a real thing and what if there's a planet that has a completely different atmosphere hooley different relationship with the star and element 115 is common like they find things in asteroids all the time that are very very rare on Earth but very common it's based it's one of the ways that they know whether or not we've been impacted like one of the ways they know that the Yucatan was hit with his gigantic asteroid that killed the dinosaurs 65 million years ago is a layer of iridium at 65 million years iridium is very very rare on Earth but very common in space and this layer of it this dense layer at 65 million years ago shows that that's when it was hit that this giant chunk of Space Rock slammed into the Earth and kill everything yeah I know I'm sorry I wish I was more and I don't I don't want to be because I really want to believe it because it also gives us a hope that we have some kind of a possible immortality summer bleed a f****** like Ray Kurzweil much anybody does he gives us all hope but I just I keep getting to a sticking point every single time there's something I can't get Beyond when it comes to that conspiracy I know what you mean I know what you mean it's look I thought it was all horseshit for a long time I was I was like I was mocking at all for a long and then Jeremy Corvallis documentary really flip the switch with names like god dammit is this real and then getting to know Jeremy and talk to him and then getting no Bob having dinner with Bob and then getting Bob to come here and sit down it was very hard to get him to come in very hard very hard he was super nervous he's getting migraines didn't want the he didn't want the scrutiny and then me while he's doing Jeremy's documentary they f****** raid his business they re is business and go through all the stuff the FBI did they caught it on video they don't it's all part that this is not just a regular guy they're going through all of his his his data to going through his all of his email that They confiscated his computers didn't find anything he's he's free and clear but they were looking for element 115 e things cuz he had some apparently and they had done some tests and there's a video of it with George Knapp where they've got like they've got fog that usually some sort of a frog they're showing how this gives off a certain gives off a certain field that makes it almost impossible to grab and touch and his fog is rejected by this field and what they're saying about that element is in a butcher this I don't really understand the science but this this gravity intensifier this gravity multiply or whatever the f*** is gravity projection thing with that 115 it distorts gravity and that's how these things are able to move through these insane through insane speeds and the way he described it is then it's like if you had like a real cushy mattress real soft mattress and you put a massive bowling ball in the center of the mattress everything we just goes and bend around the bowling ball will that's what element 115 with that craft in a propulsion system does two space-time it bends gravity and it ends bass tab and everything else gets f***** up the give you a Benny facetimes if everything else is trying to come closer together and I don't know I don't know maybe maybe maybe doesn't I don't know maybe just doesn't with whatever's around it and maybe we don't understand what you know how was space we know that gravity bends things are going to Ben's light that's why you know when you're looking at the sun you can actually see things they can see things that are actually behind the sun because it wore the mask the gravity of the sun cuz it's so enormous it actually manipulates light it been since you can see things that are actually behind it I want to know like you young she had done to deGrasse Tyson Watch times that he's fascinated and a skeptic because he made and what he knows or believes scientifically he's a DJ and he's our f****** like a guy who works at computer wait wait wait and Troy went out of with Neil deGrasse Tyson hell yeah about what government agent to end but it was a great video. But if they're not being told do you think that they tell astronomers and astrophysicists you think they tell guys like Neil deGrasse Tyson like why would they pull him aside hey hey guy who works at the Hayden planetarium we're going to we're going to give you secrets and we definitely want to make sure you don't tell him to people on the Opie and Anthony show we're going to give you secrets and we definitely want to make sure you don't tell him to people on the Opie and Anthony show Troy thinks that he knows</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> can't wait for ngannou strike I can't wait can't wait for that fight when is that scheduled for what I want to say it's April tickets just went on sale what was more impressive than anything to me in that fight was not getting knocked him out with the last 10 seconds to go but absorb all the shot out there hitting with and he kept pressing forward almost like he was invulnerable to him I never saw anybody do that to Aleister Alistair was winning that fight for sure roses truck is a f****** tank man he's a tank and he's legit 265 right unnatural 265 asses and Ghana so I think this is the first time in Ghana has ever fought a guy who has a real world class kickboxer who is also his size Nacho and is also a vicious knockout Park puncher I still thinking God of his harder I see a thing in Ghana was faster but if I was in rosenstreich corner would I would be concentrating on his leg kicks in particular because Junior dos Santos even though in Ghana starch them in the first round and come starch is almost everybody out but Junior was able to get off a lot of leg kicks early in the round and was able to at least affect him in somewhere else like okay this could be an issue the real good kickboxer now we didn't see rosenstreich use that sort of strategy against against Alistair he was really looking to put hands on Alistair he threw some kicks but really I think and if he adjusts with ngannou and tries to move away from the big shots and chop the legs he's a better kickboxer he's got real experience with Muay Thai you know but he's also a ruthless knockout Striker and he has a crazy chin golden strike has a crazy chin man can you feel bad though for overhang at the end of that like the fact it was almost like he kind of just jumped up and walked off like it was a walk-off homerun and then the rest of the night like they're going to do is face was hanging off find that KO find rosenstreich Alistair Overeem UFC does a thing that I really wish they wouldn't do and I don't understand the thought process behind it and this thing is they don't show finishes online you can't see the finishes like you'll see a guy pulling off of a guy like when they stop the fight easy walks away like but they don't show the actual finish what do think that is poor thinking exciting people want to see them make more people watch it is that to get you to fight passivation swatches stop the fight is that it at the end of it okay I wanted it to play out more because you could see how he's basically helpless I wonder if they do that to get people to go to bypass like maybe if they if we show you part of an automatic promotion for 5 to thank you I can't imagine that's true that's awesome they should just go to it if your fan yeah I mean it's five past is great and it's not just for 5 past it's got you know quintet Eddie Bravo's combat Jiu-Jitsu Zahn that a bunch of different Muay Thai organizations on that all the UFC's bypasses the ship here to suck a little bit. if you have jumped on him and they stopped that I would get it but you can see he touched him watched and touches touches in there yeah he walked off after Alistair it's a real good point messed up maybe it's just the cut was so nasty nasty by the way I just stopped it and him walking away might have fun tonight lyrics to win that one more time one more time and gets caught boom gets dropped yeah you know you're right. Right back up Ashley's good point okay now I change my mind I change my mind it was like a Rodriguez Korean zombie it's like you ever watch a fight for you if you can't not watch till the end. Elbow was insane the elbow was insane the way he threw that like a Look Away elbow and the Korean zombie just flatlines like holy s*** wasn't Rodriguez I was yes and then the Korean zombie just knocked out Frankie Edgar to take 2 years off to serve the South Korean military makes you it's mandatory it's like Israel you have to do mandatory military time</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> what do you think of I'm looking forward to I decided I kind of wanted to see Paula cost to get the fight but the fact that he's doing with Romero is still in your so great fight I'm happy it's your Romero for two reasons one because Paul Kosta they can do in the future is only like 29 years old he's a young guy do that I got a Sonia into stylistically I want to see I still see Paul Acosta Costa is a monster-man he's he's a monster really interested in seeing him fight Israel but stylistically I'm interested in your well Romero vs Israel because of the wrestling cuz your wells wrestling is crazy he's one of the most powerful guys ever fought in that division he's enormous for that Division and he's so f****** explosive and he can take a credit and crazyshot I mean if you look at the two of them together I mean is he is taller and longer yoel is just f****** jacked he's not even built like a real human his waist is tiny thing his muscles are f****** Preposterous when you see him you like that's a comic book guy that's not a real person he's a comic book person he's 40 years old 41 years old is 41 still jacked super super jacked and I think honestly he should have already been the champion I think he'd beat Robert Whittaker in a second fight my feeling is that he hurt him or he is more effective and then Newgrounds easily could have been 10-8 rounds where he had Robert Whittaker f****** staggered and if that was the case you would have won the title did he was it a split decision and remember I don't know I don't remember you Google yoel Romero vs Robert Whittaker I don't know what they mean split decisions are so crazy right like what if Thiago Santos has the UFC light heavyweight champion now be at least five judges probably should be 10 and I think we should also have an online judging I think they should have that and maybe they don't take it into consideration and turn but but for us was it's a unanimous decision what by one point on each judges scorecard and I disagreed with that but you know that's okay very interesting when is eos at March in Vegas I think it's yes it yeah he's not getting enough credit he's 12 and no he has a f****** plus left hand he's super athletic and he's really tall he's really tall and long and he's a young guy 30 years old you know and John you know John has to take that guy really f****** serious I did think if I remember correctly I remember thinking was damier won the fight I thought I thought he should have gotten a decision over. reach Jon Jones has an 83 and 1/2 by 84 and 1/2 inch reach and then you look at Dominic raises 77 that's interesting that's the width of the shoulders John is so long yeah you know you're measuring tip-to-tip like this in one thing that John excels at is keeping people at distance but he's fighting a guy that's his height that guy's just as long as him let me not as wide obviously the reaches different in terms of the width of the shoulders but Dominick Cruz is footwork and movement is X his kicks are excellent he's got nasty power in his hands and he's got a lot of confidence man is undefeated coming into 12 another guy is it killer what he did to Chris Weidman I was like holy s*** to watch hard to watch tops things on you and dudes fold like when he fought OSP he knocked out OSP with no time in the fight was basically like a couple of seconds to go in the fight he cracked OSP and they didn't give him the knockout which I don't understand Stewie was way worse than Alistair and and Roses strike me and he had OSP out he was gone and they they didn't stop the fight and I'm like I don't understand this this is like it was confusing to me because he walked away like it was over and it looked at find that Dominick Reyes drops OSP gave him some trouble he he he gave him some trouble and what I mean Dominic was definitely winning the fight but OSB has moments deadly has mom with him and I watch that fight about a month ago or so and when I was watching I was trying to find moments where I think John could capitalize at OSP couldn't but it was Pisa very strong guy is a struggle with him including Jon Jones Jon Jones to Powerhouse Manhattan you can't f****** with OSP no hiki Kayo's guys with one punch TKO Corey Anderson I think after a while I've been gone for a while and then yep they did so here it is so here's Dominick Reyes watch this he's moving boom he drops them other than he's out out like that's it and they don't stop the fight in the referee stands over and let him get back up to speed in the bell rang and they didn't call The Knockout I'm like okay that's a knockout man you could you know you couldn't justify keeping that FICO and that's what I bet your ovary wishes would have happened with they wouldn't let him just walk away and that if listen if Dan miragliotta and Jen did his job because Dan supposed to be the guy that calls a fight right I think you should have called the fight but Dan is supposed to be the guy that cause a fight not the fighter so adamek play it again with Dominic Kos him all I had to do is follow up with a couple strikes and then the f****** show's over watch this puts beautiful footwork I love how he did it to SPS moving cuz he's behind so he's trying to move forward and press and trying to catch him and Dominick's move in and OSB presses them and you know and he uses good footwork to avoid this to it catches that left kick which is osp's power side and as OSP set it up bicego Southpaw guess who's looking for that left again there it is step over bang left hand and then referees waiting for him to follow up so if you just jumped on there and followed up instead of walking with his hands up the buzzer may have gone off somewhere around then I don't know when the buzzer went off like 20 seconds see if we can get some volume on that lot last time I still think they should have stopped it but I don't know whatever he won the fight but look he basically knocked him out with a second ago stop in my opinion, so he dropped him at the horn I still think they should have stopped it but I don't know whatever he won the fight but look he basically knocked him out with a second ago</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you know but he's got a different fight in front of them this weekend with Jon Jones Jon Jones has such a history of success against the best fighters on the planet John find a way to win a guy's man he finds a way and it said that was a good thing that said Gustafson fight the first one it was such a Jones really turned it on around 4 and 5 and then rounds 4 and 5 Jones 1 MLB like f*** that's why he's a champion he won the final round and he wasn't even in shape he didn't train for that fight they said he just f***** off and was partying and having a good time he just thought he was going to be unbeatable and he said something really interesting to me when he came in here he said he always gave himself an excuse so that like if he did lose you could always say well you know what at least I didn't rain like if I trained then I would have beat that guy still beating people even though it wasn't raining hard and then he started ramp it up and actually training hard when he almost lost everything and we got arrested and all that s*** that happened to him and almost lost his career then when it came back yet much more sense of urgency cuz you realize like what a gift it really want battery was doing that in the first place just the all of it everything was wrong too much partying but sometimes someone needs some sort of a Giant's character horrible series of events will you realize like oh I can't I can't do this anymore I got to live my life in a better way yeah you have to almost have everything taken away from you but I believe the Dominick Reyes is the most dangerous fighter Jon Jones has faced since Daniel Cormier I think Dominic Reyes very unique series of challenges first of all the length the undefeated record he's 12 and no just confidence that comes undefeated Fighters and Dominic is extremely confident he's he's a believer in himself and that belief in himself has led him to stop guys like Chris Weidman to knock out OSP with one second ago he's got believe in his powers got legit one punch knockout power he's got great footwork and movement he just had the opportunity to see John struggle with Thiago Santos he has a style he can mimic that kind of success that The Chopping at the legs I think this is a dangerous fight for John but I also think John knows it's a dangerous fight for John and John is a champion a real Champion the greatest champion the light heavyweight division has ever known unquestionably and I think he's going to rise to the occasion I think we're going to see the best Jon Jones I think Jon Jones needs a real threat to scare him and work him up and I don't know if Thiago Santos was that for him maybe not as a title defense fight but I don't think I don't think that's what he gets scared of I think John needs someone like a Dominick Reyes a real threat so that you see who he was in the second fight with Daniel call me when you head kick DC and knocked him out the second fight with Gustafson gussets and we smashed out that's the real Jon Jones Jon Jones when he depressed and I think the Dominick Reyes presents a kind of a problem and I think you're going to see a f****** killer Jon Jones next weekend I think he's going to be on fire I can't wait that's a week from this Saturday Lakeland Saturday so pumped the moment I stop feeling like this I'll stop calling fights but right now I'm a f****** love it. I want to see the fight on the horizon</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> any partner just beat the crap out of me for weeks on in and I went through that and we asked Mike like Mike out or you think about this is just normal and that the feeling like this my psyche that's normal and especially in this voice the champion that I was just described in there giving him some rounds but then you take him out there and you put him in front of under the lights put 17,000 20,000 people around him and he can't do it and they just can't do it that's what makes Champions champions being able to deal and then handle all the chaotic stuff that happens before after and what's happening around them and until I and you know that I was just like man you know he's so right because guys I have watched several guys in the practice room beef doing techniques like how is that even possible like hitting you with crazy stuff but then you put them in there and put them under the lights and looks like he's an amateur that is one of the weird things about Jim's is those guys who are gym Killers yes inside the gym they're f****** killers and then for whatever reason they can't do it again. white or is that just something since I did something that's inside because I've seen guys that they know like these guys put on clinics inside the practice room but then they get out there and find a way to lose they find a way to lose it can't deal with it they can't handle the pressure they can handle everything that comes with it is find a way to lose to where you're just like how is that possible even if the guy is nowhere near the level they find a way to lose that you have had a bunch lights we don't remember most of the fight like that that's a thing that a lot of Fighters don't necessarily talk about but it's a reality of hard fights the second fight with gray where evil thing was that the referee I remember fourth-round mark my coach Mark was like you know telling me we got one more round in my head on my one more round what happened to three and four I didn't remember it all and also I when I drop me I rolled my ankle really bad probably a grade-two sprain and I remember in the fourth round coming to if my ankles hurt me I'm like what happened to I've no idea what I'm angle and they were walking back and I was kind of you know I don't know sometimes you get rakyat depressed for some reason I noticed that even to the gym when you get what I get Rockdale I got a little bit of depression going on for some reason like what does it feel like when you say depression like yourself but the fact is that was a second fight nothing ever fight the third fight you stop talking but you won't write the f****** fights that you had with gray we're so crazy they were so cute he was so big is Big Boy minutes so big 455 you know and you were a guy didn't cut any weight at all nothing you eat breakfast on the way and a wow that's crazy town you just like f****** I'm a champ want to watch that one that's why I was going to Camp why should I go down I mean I'm winning I'm beating these guys even the best fights ever super close so you know I could have went either way and I just felt me and I'll I'll go down now I lost two in a row here with me know what more can I gain from you let me go down to 45 and that's that's what I'll do for the for the for the 45 how about when you think about it like if you had a chance to do it all over again like if you had an engineer your career all over again would you do it exactly the same way with your 555 will you definitely against BJ right yeah I mean you can't go back and change it all worked out for me and I got the world title I had a problem you know I'm continuing to have a pretty good career there's always things you wish you could do differently you know I can't be like I was going to say I wish that things went the way they went what's good for them you know that. The love they gave me to to get me even just to get me there you know cuz I was ready to break man I was I was in pieces so many days in that camp is you know it was it was just a roller coaster of emotions but having them you know my father my brothers behind me that's where that strength came from and in everything we went through before butts up that's why I was so emotional in the cage and you be emotional anyways for a title fight but you know it was it was something else just to just to get their you known in and have that opportunity and you could really matter you co I mean my UCR he he's right there with his hands like powerful moment right there did it bother you that he was here a lot of sour grapes after the fight they guard did it did it did he didn't didn't really credit you for the fight was just saying most of that you want steroids my mom yeah paying our respects give him a hug but I felt like the way you handled it was uncharacteristic for him we were so respectful before after the fight I went up to him in a before they made the decision I want to tell my sugars hand I said man of Honor you know so much respect for you it was an honor to battle with you and I think to thank you and we shook hands and hugs and and you know but then he didn't stay after they raised my hand he he walked right out we didn't shake hands again and then everything else yet really surprised me I think it was just hard to two because you know this was my 10th by he'd already had over 50 he was a big he was a big favorite I just don't think you know he they were very confident they were very confident leading up to the fight and I don't think anyone imagined me to walk out of there with that belt the plan was formed in 1865 at the end of the Civil War and it was formed by a by 6 Confederate soldiers who were of Irish and Scottish descent and what they did was they borrowed the the rituals or similar rituals and names and a mystery from the Scottish Rite Masons ran this or that, exactly if you see playing groups out in public they will hold a unified front but behind closed doors they don't like each other real yeah so anyway if you have a chapter of your particular plan route in another state or in multiple States you may then consider yourself or your group to be a national claim group therefore you must have a national leader who oversees all the states in which you have a chapter of your particular group so we call our national leader the president and Clan terminology that person is known as the Imperial wizard anybody who is prefix with the word Imperial is that person is a national officer wizard being the top if you're a wizard by the president and Imperial playlist will be like a vice president and the other secretaries treasurer's whole nine yards and then the next level down would be State the head of the state which we call the governor that person is known as a grand Dragon anybody Grand is on the state level State officer Dragon being the top of the oven a grande playlist will be like a lieutenant governor and then secretary-treasurer and then within the state you have counties the county leader is known as the great Titan anybody on the great level isn't on the county level within the county you have districts what they call clatterans and we would call a district leader of Mayor a councilman Alderman that individual is known as they are as an exalted cyclops Cyclops what you would say Sir exalted Cyclops that's hilarious to make him look bad that he supports me or that he used my endorsement read the Bernie Sanders and all I said is I'm probably going to vote for him I like Tulsi gabbard I really love her a little Kim I love Andrew Yang those people to think like a really important point I'm a f****** moron if you're basing who you're going to vote for President Trump for president based on my what I like I know I'm not I'm not that balls deep into this stuff is not it's not based on your look muscular bald-headed white guy I don't know if this would be I bet this be a different game what's easy to paint me as a douchebag right and also the thing that I said in the video was exactly what they did I said if you just take the worst aspects of someone take out everything else magnify it right and you know you can paint them out to be a real piece of s*** today but it's hard to do that on the front lines in the 60s civil rights like getting change required to make the military function correctly gas work I mean maybe we're better off with Trump maybe we're better off with someone else I don't know what's required to be a president I really don't I don't understand what's required to make sure the economy functions correctly and also I don't understand what's required to make the military function correctly now it just gas work I mean maybe we're better off with Trump maybe we're better off with someone else I don't know</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> voting for us cuz it's so it's so obvious what it is they're using me to make him look bad that he supports me or that he used my endorsement red probably I think like a really important point I'm a f****** moron if you're basing who you're going to vote for on President Trump for president based on my right what I like I know I'm not I'm not that balls deep in this stuff is not it's not very strange is a little out of left field but how much of this is based on your look if you are in a muscular bald-headed white guy I don't know if this would be easy to paint the douchebag and also what is the thing that I said in the video was exactly what they did I said if you just take the worst aspects of someone take out everything else magnify it right and you know you can paint them out to be a real piece of s*** today but it's hard to do that that doesn't mean I don't know what's required to be a president I really don't I don't understand what's required to make sure the economy functions correctly and also I don't understand what's required to make the military function correctly now it's just gas work I mean maybe we're better off with Trump maybe we're better off with someone else I don't know but what was fascinating to me was that these people f****** CNN homophobic and transphobic that's completely out of context that the only is it was first trans people some trans people listen to I got nothing but love for you for everybody and is backed Eddie Izzard is one of my all-time favorite love is he's one of the most inspirational and brilliant people I've ever met I love that guy and he's probably one of the most public trans people in the first most public celebrities to go trans don't care that's what it what I was saying in the video that using was me saying you're f****** man definitely shouldn't use those words but this is why I was upset it was a guy that this person was a man for 30 years transition to become a woman for 2 years and then started fighting women in MMA and didn't tell them that she used to be a man and was smashing girl she literally broke this girl skull but broke her face and was bragging about it like she you know she was hyping up her MMA career right yet and then people found out that she was a trans woman and she used to be a man she said that she didn't have to disclose that because it was a medical procedure had nothing to do wasn't there their business very shady and in fact a woman bought the UFC a girl named Ashlee evans-smith who's a really good fighter you know UFC kalra fighter unlike this other woman who was the trans woman that trans women just really strong the same caliber the world class martial arts Ashlee evans-smith actually one of beating her he looks like a guy right up bro yeah and then when he became a woman he looked you know like definitely could saves a woman that dude lady but you know I was like the f*** out of here you're not specifically Napa take for sport but we all know that when a guy hits a girl in the street is a different vibe than when a girl hit the guy that's the problem is that's what the flights look like hitting a girl damn and also fighting people that aren't that skilled it's a low-level MMA promotion you know and then we came out there was all this outrage but what was really fascinating was how many people are mad at me but didn't have an equal amount of the word equally upset that woman was deceptive what you can about the fact that she was trans it's bad for the cause of transgender people it's very bad for the cause of you have a transgender woman that doesn't disclose she's transgender and is beating the f*** out of biological women and here's the here's one of the big problems with It ultimately want to get f***** over our biological women in this whole race to be woke and including transgender women in female sports biological women of the ones getting f***** over these trans any world records and becoming world champions and it's you know it is this it's where the rubber meets the road between pragmatic objective people they're analyzing the all of the facts and people who want to stick with a woke ideology they don't want to hear it on the other side this is a big one that people are calling me out on the homophobia nothing but love for gay people nothing but love I love gay people but I make fun of them I make fun of me fun of my mom I'll make fun of you when you're here I'll make fun of you when you leave here before one of my most popular memes online isn't support gay marriage and it was it says if you if you hate gay marriage is because I wanted two reasons either you're dumb or you're secretly worried that dicks are delicious friend that has been shared f****** millions of times in fact I had a gay strong man in here and he was talking about candy was talking about illiteracy thought that wasn't he had seen that was one of the first exposures that he had to me yeah well it just looking for s*** that Pindi and that's all it's to marginalize him and it's also people that don't want anyone who's not woke to represent anything on the left you were going to be on the left there's a lot of people been overwhelming and really heartwarming from made from great comics and scientists and people that have held the podcast Psychology today wrote an article about how the media is gas-lighting you on me like they're like they're trying to pay this guy out to be this monster like how I said stupid s*** 100% I've done 1,400 plus podcast a lot of them high like a giant percentage of I said a bunch of stupid s*** I could even believe while saying it I'd like to say inappropriate work I do it all the time because it's fun I like I like staying where you're not supposed to say sometimes but it doesn't mean I'm homophobic or love everybody like literally if you're a nice person I love you cool with everybody the way they want it to be true and a guy down it feels more like vindictive and it hurt you than it does let's save the world it's more like if you go I'm actually not I would ever lose a couple things going on one this podcast gotten way too big and it actually can influence elections about it it's all changing it's all silly I would love if they revamped the system and made it so there was like a council of really smart people who get to decide on things completed hands carefully to play chess what to give up on he could have swayed the lack of any was in charge of s*** so he could make policies Hillary Clinton wouldn't believe in gay marriage still 2013 but it's not real it's that they're in their world they're giving up on the is take me down to make Bernie look bad because Bernie dare to post one of my videos in the meantime Bernie is search the number one the pole number one and number one for the first time in the bedding poles so it's like look I don't know if it's good or bad well it's like Chappelle everybody hates chapelli's the transphobic guy of the Year whatever he's won the Grammy three years in a row for best comedy album Andy just want the Mark Twain award so it's like we talked a big game we complained and bitched and moaned but I think the real ships out there well even more more telling when Rotten Tomatoes only what critics judge his special he had a 0% Rotten Tomatoes then when they let the general public do it jumped up to 99 by giant company now if you are part of a giant Mediacom between even have to say any names you have to make arrangements with political parties and candidates they will give you access to candidates but they in exchange they would like you to run certain stories do like you to cover things they would like you to not cover other things mean you're seeing this anti Bernie Sanders pushed across the board Hillary Clinton just came out and said that she thinks she nobody likes him I saw that what do you hate your old musically likes and she said that he's a career politician like that man were you involved in Industry before did you manufacture televisions that are in support of apples Warren that were trying to push the narrative the Bernie Sanders is sexist up that narrative, she said that he had said to her then we could never be president did you ever see that in exchange for the two of them were on CNN so this is what it's been for me just to watch all this play out but I just the first time I seen you rattle by the way I think all right get it but that's why if I feel if I look rattled but that's the positive thing has been the outpouring of support so many people against overwhelming support two negatives the ratios incredible so it's it's awesome well the good news is everyone who knows you likes you all the people were saying s*** I probably never met you or don't even listen to podcast this is the problem with human beings communicating through social media's with the worst way like Twitter or Sunday's the worst way to either know someone expressive him or show any compassion and no one this is one of the reasons why cancel culture is so right right cuz this is the best way to cancel somebody threw a tweet f*** you field of virtue signaling this insanely mediocre on talented comedians Michelle wolf or Michael Che and all this act Lee especially when the the leaked audio came out people at the most inappropriate s*** that's funny I feel as much guilt and shame and numbness you don't feel you don't feel any keyboard you don't feel anything I'm hoping that social media will evolve to something that you the people that somehow or another allow people to be more compassion to each other and maybe we'll just understand how to use it better understand and everybody is canceled right everybody choco-story Africa she was an Ambien and hope I don't get AIDS just kidding on white LOL that's a good tweet it's a good show it's a joke Le Mark Normand joke logically right but when you're on Ambien and your f****** liquored-up edit time we change the whole world will be on the air at the end of the day with all this this s*** it's my feelings about all this are it's it's interesting to see the the the hate Brigade come my way and it's interesting it's it's very heartwarming to see support yet it's also you know at the end of the day I forgot a giant body of work about what I am and what I've done people watch the Elon Musk interview they're not like that at all the homophobia inappropriate jokes yeah for sure you're swinging right you know how it is when we're doing worse or hit you to come your way a lot of them are high like I'm Goin In is race in the stupidest people that's just their grasping at straws I got nothing it's not real racism it's a joke these Brown is racism I get some s*** stirring up that was a crazy thing about the CNN articles like they put in all the isms all the isms and all the phobias and like</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you have to work yeah man but I'll tell you something though not all of them. Most of them but some of the of the hardest-working people that I've ever seen in my life have been in the plan and I'm serious I mean working hard to make a living and support their families is there a universal Factor like when you talk about how they got involved in it is it the neighborhood is it people that they Family Guy people join the planet different reasons in some cases it's my grandfather was in the clan my daddy was in the clan so I'm in the clan in my kitchen I mean the plan it's a family tradition right passed down and when you are dealing with somebody with that kind of time that you know that generational thing it make it a little longer for them to come out it is hard to break family tradition write another reason why people join you take a depressed town like a coal mining town in West Virginia or Scranton Pennsylvania isn't that what people who are not racist they are hard workers they did call all their lives grandfather. Candice rugg they wouldn't know how to do it all in those big and Cole and they're happy that I'm making their paycheck if you and their family paying the rent whatever you're not concerned about people color their happy but then the company gets greedy and decided hey you know what we can we can save money make a lot more money if we lay off or out our employees and hire some of these of these immigrants were there legal or illegal 44 less than half of what we're paying our people right after they left these people and how are these people just came over to the country looking for work and and they pay the Nester nothing so now these white people who would never racist or out of a job did the bank is going to foreclose on the trailer or their house or whatever they can't put food on their table the Clancy's these things and the clan will come to a depressed down like that and hold it I said the blacks have the n-double-acp the Jews have the ADL you know nobody stands up for the white man but the clan come join us will get your job back you know that that was your job your job not going but you're gone and now some some Niger or some Spitz that your job you know why is that come join us so these people Cobra 25 years you know and I got laid off for no reason and something else is doing my job so what do I have to lose human application and they sign up so they're like you know coerced into this group they may be a little easier to come out you know we talked with them then a third reason why people join if somebody relocate to a town that is very Clan oriented lot of people live you do what you want to do business in that town you better simulate you know you join the local country club Local Chamber of Commerce and the local KKK so you know there's it was different reasons why people join and dependent again it'll depend upon how strong the ties are why they join can determine the longevity of there or their their hold on it what is the one that took you the longest to crack well I'll be honest with you I never set out to convert anybody and even though in the media it will say black musician Converse 200 klansman or at some other clan members I didn't confront anybody I don't even convert one of them I will say that I am the impetus for over 200 leaving the clan yeah I know I know that for a fact that people have told me Yaya. I'm out of because of you with Insight that but I did not convert them they converted themselves I gave them reason to think about their Direction in life and they thought about it and thought you know I need a better path and this is the way to go because what would happen would be this it's like when you when you believe in something some people just believe in a just because it's a sad person saying it like like in a weed we have a current president where no matter what he says something I believe he's all right and that any president really if you are a big fan no matter what you do what you say you have a base that's going to believe you so I would tell these people what I saw fault with what they were saying in their ideology I said well let me tell you why I think this is incorrect and I lay out the facts for them and then they now they did not I can see right there they go home and check it out and it rolls around their head and it began thinking you know Darryl does have a point but he's black is black but he does have a point but he's black so even though they know it's true they don't want to believe it cuz I'm black so that that cognitive dissonance thing going on so that they have a internal struggle and they had to make up their own mind do I continue living a lie cognitive dissonance then going on so that they have an internal struggle and they have to make up their own mind do I continue living a lie or do I turn my life around and if the truth</div>

Mary's and and his his partner but you guys wrote the book they are there documentation and and and see they they they go by things that they can see and understand I'm going to give me an example of something help you understand the Cyclops was riding around in my car one day with me he's sitting in my passenger seat right we're driving I'm driving along and somehow we got on the topic of a black crime and he made a statement he said well you know in a we all know they say that again that Vape Authority say that black people have a gene in them that makes them and I heard that before Mother clam people that's one of the narrative and you know the Wild Black Savage, thing and he said he was someone else live there but I'm leaving very high crime written by people but that's what lives there I said who's doing all the crime in Bangor Maine white people because that's what lives there I said you know you're not even considering the demographics how do you explain that this man did not wait one second he answered me like that he said you were translating hasn't come out yet somebody who's that far enough feel right I didn't say that all white people have a gene that makes them a serial killer is that how you figure that I said name me three black serial killers he couldn't do it either here I'm going to give you one I mean one for him I think you're just just met me to he couldn't do it I said Charles Manson Jeffrey Dahmer Henry Lee Lucas John Wayne Gacy Albert desalvo The Boston Strangler Bundy David Berkowitz Son of Sam at game me to say that about you and what you said about me and you got very quiet but I mean you could almost see a joke this will go on your zeni-ya and now he's thinking about it and then he changed the subject but within 4-5 months he left the clan based on that conversation and his robe was it very first robot ever got is he called me and I was in that area and the NICU when you want to get together and I got together with them anyway to go over to the courthouse for something how you been something to trouble will go pick up something the courthouse so I gave him a ride over there and he told me he was he was going to quit the clan you know and he thought a lot about what I said and I said what you going to do with your stuff the trash it I said I said no. and all my class. And I said yeah he goes why would you want that I didn't know why but something told me just take it down just take it so I never been in a parking lot and I took the one in and I'm walking up the stairs with him to the apartment I'm thinking no I hope I'm not getting set up here you know but I walked on in and his fiance was sitting on the couch classroom and I've seen it before and side down talk with her a new one down the hall to this room and came back with it we came back you got a hefty trash bag went back there again and came back with this trash bag all loaded up I just rode his Hood climbing belt buckle membership stuff in this bad and gave it to me and I said okay thank you now and I didn't know why I wanted it but I just knew I should have it well first of all is history okay and you don't destroy history The Good the Bad the Ugly in the shameful is still American history and the KKK have said it before is as American As baseball apple pie and Chevrolet and is a single part of our history these are just another West now I know what I'm doing the stuff I got my 501 c 3 I'm going to have a museum one day and put all the stuff in there why what's a 501 c 3 tax-exempt this is a grand dragon robe green is the sign for the Grand Dragon and which is arrivals when I first heard of Bobwhite I was in my late teens and he heard about it on the news he had been busted arrested and put in jail for conspiring to bomb a synagogue in Baltimore up on Liberty Road delivery Rose a synagogue and he was convicted and went to prison before years after doing his time continued one of the clan and then some years later you got busted again assault with intent to murder two black men with a shotgun right now understand something as a plan leader you don't make any money or not allow us to embezzling money from the dues a lot of people do that that's what causes he's running groups if you're a leader like a wizard or Dragon you might get small stipend out of the Jews but not enough to pay your rent and put food on your table so you have to have a regular job yo Cyclops wizard dragon whatever is all just titles like Boy Scout leader you have to have a regular job to pay your rent and mortgage this man's regular job when he was doing all this nonsense bombing places and stuff Baltimore City police officer yeah he was not an undercover cop in the Clan Gathering intelligence was a bona fide klansman on the Baltimore City police force okay and they're more than more okay but he went on this guy was anti-semitic and racist and very very violent but he went on to become one of my best friends and he gave me his Klan robe police uniform electric all over the country and stuff he quit the police force he was forced to quit the police force or be fired the police force Baltimore City police force and the year they had a consent decree from the Department of Justice against them they are very racist and very corrupt what they would do is they would turn a blind eye to The Clansman on the force cuz you know as a police officer you're not allowed to two-person groups a blind eye as long as the guys would not bring unwanted attention to the to the department and I just keep keep your stuff you know whatever well if you would end up getting busted for the planting a bomb near synagogues and in the shop. publicity this is before he left the clan yeah so what did he do after you did that you had to get another job on kitchens pbn dealing in a homing pigeons Oculus way to transmit information that's perfect</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> iRig story I saw a thing about you on NPR and is crazy you've converted how many people 200 KKK members got them to drop their robes like some directly some indirectly yes, that'll happen wow continue playing on playing music in Frederick Maryland white bar am I say all white I don't mean that blacks can go in when I mean is that the Blatz chose not to go and they weren't welcome and I here I wasn't this bar with this country band friend of mine's man I was only black guy in the van only black guy in the bar add Upon finishing the first set this I'm walking into the band table and somebody came up with their arm around my shoulder after I asked you what was in my journal and maybe 15 18 years older than me and he says yeah I just joined the band and he said well man I really like your piano playing this is the first time I've ever heard a black man play piano like Jerry Lee Lewis and I wasn't I wasn't offended but I'd rather surprised because I thought maybe 15 years older than me. No blues and Boogie Woogie piano players with the guy was incredulous on IG really invented that I never heard no black man play like that just for you something okay with this this guy never heard of Little Richard or Fats Domino and look man I know Jerry Lee Lewis's friend of mine told me himself but it was so fascinated that he want to buy me a drink go back to the stable out of cranberry juice and then he announces this is the first time I've ever sat down had a dream with a black man and now I'm I know it was incredulous like how can that be you know I've sat down with thousands of white people anybody else had a meal a beverage a conversation how was it this guy had never done that and innocently I asked him why he didn't answer me and I asked him again and his buddy Misty and elbowed him in the side I said tell him tell him tell him to tell me well I burst out laughing Supremacy white supremacy the KKK and Nazis the neo-nazis understand this mentality and I knew a klansman would not come up and just throw his arm around some black guy Shoulder imprezas talent when I get to hang out with him buy me a drink around so I'm laughing and he goes about his pocket and pulled out his wallet and producer and I recognized for your clan Insignia which is a red circle with a white cross and a red blood drop in the center of the Cross and I realize oh man this thing's for real so I stopped laughing and wasn't funny anymore and I give it back to him and we chatted about the clan and different things but the dude gave me his phone number and want me to call him whenever I was returned to this bar so he can bring his Friends Meeting fly when is women to see this black guy. Really I'm not sure you call me a black eye to a friend's brother it's right the game in street clothes and on the break I would go to the stable say hello some of them were very curious and hang out there and want to meet me and talk to me or see me coming and get up and take off and do it stands for the part of the room where is like I just want to see you I don't want to deal with you so that was fine and I decided later on I would write a book because I've been looking for an answer formed when I was h10 my question was how can you hate me when you don't even know me and this was a result of having March in a Cub Scout parade at the age of 10 being the only black Scout in to supper Aid and why most people on the streets and sidewalks with cheering us yeah we're marching from Lexington to Concord Massachusetts to commemorate the ride of Paul Revere if you want waving flags and yelling and screaming the British are coming in all of the time except for one small pocket of people who were throwing rocks and bottles at me and at age 10 my first thought was oh those people over there don't like the scouts are not easy but was it was until my Den mother of my tub Master my troop leader all came rushing over and huddled over move their bodies is white people squirting me out of the danger but I realize I was only target cuz nobody else was getting his protection and these were adults are these rather chill these were a couple is maybe about 5 people I'm going to get me a couple of kids making my age is a year older adults adults were throwing rocks and bottles at a ten-year-old boy correct wow the number to find out what did I do you know what why they're doing this to me I think it was no suction me tell me to hurry up move along to be okay so they never answer the question is why this is happening when I got home that day after this parade my mother and father who would not there or premature Chrome and Band-Aids on me and asked me how did I fall down and get all scraped up I took out in fall down I told her exactly what it happened and for the first time in my life my mom and dad sat me down and explain to me what racism was at the age of 10 I never heard the term racism now was serviced every two years come back home for a few months and then you get reassigned to another so when I was overseas and Elementary School my classes were filled with kids from all over the world anybody who had an embassy in those countries all US Embassy kids went to the same school my class was full of kids from Nigeria Italy France Germany Japan Russia you name it if you were to open the door to my classroom and stick your head in you will say this was like United Nations of little kids cuz that's exactly what it was we all have long then I would come home after that to your assignment and I would be in either all black schools or all white schools I start all black shoes or all black and white schools meaning being still segregated for the newly integrated schools and there was not the amount of diversity in my classroom that I had over seas the day you walk into a classroom you know you can't tell from the mall over so literally between 1961 and like 1968 1970 I was living about 12 years into the future when I was living overseas because that that Multicultural seen have yet to come to this country and want to do the course I was already prepared unfortunately my fears were not so and not taking this path so I was very curious about it and fascinated with it like hopping somebody hit you and you don't even know you was just beyond my comprehension and I knew something was wrong because the people who did this to me did not look any different than my little French friends my Swedish friend or my fellow Americans in the embassy or for that matter my fellow Americans right there you know whoever at the school where I went to the March so I knew it wasn't a color thing in fact when my parents told me this I did not believe my parents I thought for some reason my parents are lying to me cuz my ten-year-old brain could not process the idea that someone would never seen me had never spoken to me and you know nothing about me would want to inflict pain upon me for no other reason than the color of my skin so I do not believe them well a month-and-a-half later that same year on April 4th Martin Luther King was assassinated and I remember it very well we were in Massachusetts same place and nearby Boston Washington DC My Hometown Chicago Illinois Philadelphia Detroit Baltimore Richmond La all burned to the ground with violence and destruction all in the name of this new word that I learned call racism and so they I realized my parents were told me the truth this phenomenon called racism does exist but why I don't understand why I'll guess it was here but why and so that's when I found that question how can you hate me you don't even know me and so I've been looking for the answer to that question now for 51 years I must have 20 years old so after I met this klansman new 3-4 months later I put that band and went back to playing rock and roll and blues and R&amp;B and then it dawned on me Daryl you know the answer that you've been seeking since age ten fell right into your lap who better to ask that question of how can you hate me we don't even know me then to ask if of somebody who would go so far as to join an organization whose Apprentice has been hating people who do not look like them I do not believe is they believe and its organization has been around for over a hundred years somebody would go that far to join the KKK should damn sure have an answer to your question so get back in time tack with that guy ratifications talking to a klansman or interviewing them I would have easier access or could join the clan undercover get the story get out and write about it so my book became the first book ever written by black author on the Food Plus plan for the perspective of sitting down face-to-face I decided I would go around the country interview Flanders there in Maryland where I live up north down South Midwest and West and I so I got a hold of that guy and I want him to introduce me to cook family therefore Maryland what was his reaction when I'm when I go to my I want to know what makes you guys Tik Tok why you doing this Barton silver dollar lounge and I called it's like months later and it would have been disconnected so I can track him down turned out again moved you never phone probably would get an address and so I have no way of knowing you know letting you know I might come over and talk to you so I should Rebecca's apartment one evening and knock on the door and I didn't see the gyno while right you probably know what you doing here I looked up and down the hallway see if I brought anybody with me and Emily stepped out of his apartment I stepped in so we turn around comes back in those what's going on you still playing what's going on I said yeah I'm playing but I need to talk to you with the plan so the plan I said yeah you remember right it was well I was but I quit anyone into this long dissertation that's the white with the plan so long story short I said I want to beat the clan neither did he quit the clan interaction with you no not no actually he lied to me yes he was no longer in the clan but what happened was he said he quit because he didn't he didn't like their birthday or ideology I later found out in my research that and I got this from the guy who banished him that you delete her about that particular claim group vanished like they are ideology I later found out in my research that and I got this from the guy who banished him being the leader of that particular Clan group vanished</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> Liberty Mutual in the hierarchy of the plant okay okay today there's no such thing as the Ku Klux Klan there used to be there today there aren't many who cuts playing groups and they all are autonomous that use the same name two bucks plan you might have the Dixie Knights of the Ku Klux Klan the Confederate Knights of the Ku Klux Klan the rebel Knights on and on these are all separate two bucks playing groups they believe in the same ideology they wear the same colors on their robes that designate their rank they have the same stupid hand Trick The Flame the secret handshake in 1865 at the end of the Civil War and it was formed by a by 6 Confederate soldiers who were of Irish and Scottish descent and what they did was they borrowed the the rituals or similar rituals and names and a mystery from the Scottish Rite the Masons grandison are they exactly said over the years Central split apart in the different groups of plan so and they all are Rivals with each other if you see a couple different plan routes out in public they will hold a unified front but behind closed doors they don't like each other really yeah somebody embezzled from plan dues or didn't get promoted you know whatever so anyway if you have a chapter of your particular plan route in another state or in multiple States you may then consider yourself or your group to be a national claim group therefore you must have a national leader who oversees all the states in which you have a chapter of your particular group so we call our national leader the president and Clan terminology that person is known as the Imperial wizard anybody who is who is prefix with the word Imperial is that person is a national officer wizard being the top I so if you're a wizard like a president and Imperial playlist would like a vice president and he have secretaries treasurer's whole nine yards and then the next level down would be State the head of the state which we talked about that person is known as a grand Dragon everybody Grand is on the state level State officer Dragon be the top Governor a grande playlist will be like a lieutenant governor and then secretary-treasurer and then within the state you have counties the county leader is known as the great Titan anybody on the great level isn't on the county level within the county you have districts with a call klaverns and we will call a council Menaul a councilman Alderman that individuals known as they are as an exalted cyclops</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I want you to meet the starting Maryland where I live I want start with the claim that if America could have several different plant groups in the same state and they are Rivals with each other and you have chapters of those same things with interstate so this guy named Rodger Kelly was the Grand Dragon for the state of Maryland for this guy's Landreth and Rodger Kelly the time had the largest clam proof in Maryland how many members they don't give out numbers but the Rodger had probably just over 200 for which is a very high number for that time. Sometimes it's only only have 10 members some you know they have an internet presence was only one God sending his basement putting out something anyway this guy both get in trouble anymore is it doesn't matter I cannot take a black man to the Grand Dragon so he was concerned for my safety as well as why don't you give me his address and phone number and I will go to his house and talk to him and he would not do that I begged and pleaded for 20 minutes he finally gave me mr. Kelly's address and phone number wow on the condition that I not tell mr. Kelly wear got it and I'm I said okay and he warned me to Daryl for the clan but that was one of their headquarters you know Thurmont Maryland because it's also , Camp David the presidential Retreat and and the headquarters for the class right there right down the road that's hilarious white town anytime a black person moved in or interracial couple or gay couple somehow mysteriously across if you burn in the yard and boom they move right out now that is not that does not mean that every person in Thurmont is in the clan because they're not in fact most white people up there one of the clan but that's where it was headquartered so nice it was a bar up there where they hang out every Saturday night and about if I go to that bar I'm sure to find Rodger Kelly and you left your out-of-town routing somewhere he says by don't guarantee you that Rodger will even talk to you but you're safer to approach him in a public place then Corners property did he give you a photograph of you find it I never met him but I knew you know his image so he drove me a little map how to get to this place after it's laid off and do not do not own property as a ride so I and I'm a musician gecko gecko chasing the clan on Saturday nights at the hobby profession I told my secretary who books my band I said you know do I have any Sundays off I figured Sunday still part of the weekend maybe hands and she's white not that I have a problem with that man walking with white women wanting your Clam Bar could be boring behind me if I turn around and face you start running and I'll be behind you and she says alright let's go so we walk in about 7:30 on a Sunday evening but it was practically empty I would say maybe no more than six or seven people in their couple guys in the back playing pool a diet you sitting at the bar and the guy told me this was a clam bar and we met by Clam Bar is the plan doesn't own it I doubt that he described it to me then when you walk in the door to your left will be a row of booths and the first to Boos closest to the door when you come in or reserved for the clan so over there and nobody was sitting there so I'm looking around see if I recognized plan but I should you know what an end to my right a Long Bar behind the bar was a mirror and Scotch tape to the mirror was a picture and article from The Washington Post newspaper had a picture of Rodger Kelly that interviewed him about something the nwacp was doing them over some kind of cross burning ceremony or something and I recognize the article I said wow is a big Confederate flag on the back wall like you have the US flag right there do I knew I was in the right place or the wrong place. But I won't look at it right so I didn't see anybody look like Rodger Kelly I feel you know I drove an hour and a half to get up here again I don't want to go home empty-handed but I didn't want to just walk up somebody's ass cancer you in the plan so I said, Mary let's go over there and sit in one of those first two payments because if the plan is in here they will come to us and then we'll know and then we can ask them hey we want to see Rodger Kelly so much that down nobody bothered so then was cool eventually we migrated over the bar I chatted up the guy sitting next to me like I was lost in sin directions very nice give me directions we failed so we laugh the next morning Mary what kind of my house I gave a Rodger Kelly's number Monday morning I should give him a call I said tell him that you're working for somebody who's writing a book on the clan will he consent to sitting down with your boss and giving him an interview however do not tell mr. Kelly but I'm glad if you ask no don't lie to him but don't Lulu to it don't give me reason to be curious to understood I did not want him to know that was a I figured if you knew that him and I can do the interview but if you agree to do the interview then obviously it would see that I'm blocked me when he meets me that you decided right then and there if you want to continue it or not but I want him to see me first and secondly if you could do the interview knowing that I was black he may have different answers prepared did you have for a white interviewer that's supposed to apply him if you are so I want to be spontaneous candid so she understood and that she called him and he agreed to do the interview so we set it up for the motel above the silver dollar Lounge at the in Frederick Maryland at 5:15 on a Sunday afternoon and Mary and I got there are several hours early I gave her some money center Deborah Hall how to get dust out of the machine put in the ice bucket filled with Ice Cube real cold so I offered average cold beverage I have no idea what this man would do once you laid eyes on me so that I was black when you come in the room where you attack me or you walk away and I know but in the event I want to be hospitable so she got the soda pop with nice buckets that on the dresser now just by happenstance the way the room is laid out if you are standing in the hallway in the doorway of of the room looking into the room you cannot see who's in the room if they literally walk in the door and turn to your right and the room is laid out back there so there's no way you can know who's in the room standing in the hallway and so I took advantage of that I took the lamp table to the lamp off and put it in the most obscure corner of the room and I put a chair on one side for me and a chair on there mr. Kelly and I have a little bad beside me like duffle bag and in my bag I had a cassette recorder blank cassette tapes and copy of the Bible because the Ku Klux Klan claims to be a Christian organization and they claim that the Bible preaches racial separation now I've read the Bible I've never seen that in there so I wouldn't be able to pull up my Bible when he brings it up and said he was the Kelly show King James version chapter and verse where it says blacks and whites must be separate so I'm not prepared right right on time at 5:15 knock on the door I've see the day where you can't see me if you come in the room Mary hops up and by the way Mary White and before so she goes around the corner open the door and walks what is known as The Grand Nighthawk inflated terminology music bodyguard security so a grand Nighthawk names is so ridiculous cyclops's dragons and Wizards play camouflage on one side of his chest is that Clan Emblem that red circle white cross blood drop on the other side of the initials KKK and embroidered on his Paredes at Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and on the ship he had a semi-automatic handgun in a holster he comes in and mr. Kelly is walking directly behind him in a dark blue suit and tie and when the Nighthawk turn the corner and saw me he just mr. Not realize that his nighthawking stop short and he slammed into his back and knock them forward and so they're stumbling around regaining their balance and looking all around the room and I'm just watching them and I just see the apprehension in their faces has SSA hey I'm an armed and I walked forward I stuck at my right hand I said hi mr. Kelly I'm Daryl Davis and he shook my hand he shook my hand and The Nighthawks with my hand so so far so good I'm doing I'm doing well do you have any form of identification as a sure I forgot my wallet and I handed him my driver's license 230 goes you live on 2nd and Silver Spring why is this man reading my street address all you have to do is look at my name look at my picture match it up to me and give me back my license. Like looking at my address is she going to come what's up so I did not want to let him know that he had you know unnerved the other woman I want to let him know under no circumstances are you to come to my house Uninvited with any Dino nefarious intentions so I said to him I said yes mr. Kelly that is where I live and you live at and I named his house number and histories know that the guy getting me that way I was implying hey you know you know where I live I know where you if you come visit me I'm going to come visit you so it will show you know we're going to confine all this visiting to this motel room so he smiled he nodded his head like he understood and I did not find out that day it was several months down the road that I've been presumptuous I had no reason to fear mr. Kelly coming to my house to do anything stupid what happened was one of his clan members lived right road from me I didn't know that I missed you Kelly would have to travel down my my street to get into that neighborhood where is my member live decently recognize the name of the street that was it you were going so he wasn't trying to threaten you no not at all not at all so today that same plan member is in a federal prison will be there for a long time he he he would later commit a crime which landed in the federal penitentiary so i n e we got on his interview and within 10 minutes mr. Let me know why you hate people like like me black people are inferior we're prone to Crime there we were criminals that is why there are more blacks in prison than whites now that's a half-truth there are indeed more blacks in prison than white people if not like you said it's because of iniquity in our Judicial System we're whites in the same predicament either don't get the same jail time or don't go to jail or whatever anyway so you know and also this book bell curve I just recently come out and Marie you know the one I'm sitting there listen to this guy tell me that I'm a criminal and I'm lazy and on welfare and my brain is smaller than his what he was saying was Indy defensive but here's a difference between me and most of the people I did not take offense to it I'll tell you why I not take offense to it why should I be offended by somebody who knows nothing about me the only met me 10 minutes ago he sees the color of my skin and its neighbors assessment so why should I take offense to somebody who's telling a lie I just want to roll on with it when did you develop this kind of clarity but it's very unusual to not be offended when someones judging you instantly and saying disparaging things about everyone that looks anything like you just right off the cuff freely right in front of you how did you develop this Clarity to this not be offended by that because it didn't make sense what he was saying of course so I figure you know how I be offended by somebody who's who's all twisted Ryan you know obviously doesn't have the the foresight to see that he's wrong I want to learn more about this which is coming from man and so now see that's what stops a conversation and then and then people get it to come back yes you know and that it goes nowhere so I was send it along with it and then when he's finished you know and he was most proud of you explain to me in a wide stance I still get what I mean with you I don't have a criminal record I have never been on welfare I've never measured my brain but I'm sure it's the same size as anybody else's whatever go on well right I reach down into my bag of fresh to set orbit sicario pound the table mr. Davis the Bible says I reach down Pull up the Bible every time I reach down like this you get the Bible or the cassette out of the bag me a Nighthawk up onto his head right now well yeah but you know I realize that these people are afraid of me okay so you know I had to be flown out for you then so I'd be cool but be transparent all right so and a cop tells you to get your license or whatever and you listen to do is in the glove box and you reach he gets a little more tighter on the town he's protecting himself so now. Was doing that and I got that so it was kept happening and after a while he realized it was no threat in the bag and I went in and out of the bag and I talked didn't move he was relaxed just over an hour interview there was a sudden a very quick I'm in less than a second noise in the room when that was it and it happened so fast out of nowhere that my ear could not discern what it was I just came out of the blue and I'm sitting closer than you and I are right now the tables smaller than mr. Kelly and I talked with was here and there and I my chair at the table because my ear could not discern what the noise was I perceived it to be an ominous threatening noise and I knew I knew for a fact that mr. Kelly had made this noise where did it come from why do you make it and how did I know that he made it I knew that because I didn't make it so you know if you if you don't want to accept responsibility or you know you're not responsible what do you do you assign blame night and so I slipped out of my chair hit the table and my mind was racing what did I just did what did I just say to cause this to Kelly to go off and make some threatening noise you know I instantly put everything in perspective we're enemies he's ahead of the clan I'm a black guy and now you know and then I heard that voice in my head Darrell do not fool with Rodger Kelly he will kill you so I don't want to die and in that Split Second I have gone into survival mode and when you fear for your life that's what you do what was that noise and actually hit the table well when you fear for your life as I said you know you do into survival mode and in survival mode you know you're only lonely do like one of four things some people they just pass out if they ain't because of fear is so great their brain cannot process it and it shuts down and then pass out other people there are there muscles contracted to get tense and they can't move and you can be punching and kicking them and then one of them put in the blows there are constricted that's called paralysis by fear that you're too afraid to move the Third Bank people would do is just run away from whoever's of the fear is and that is your best option when something scares you that bad take off separate yourself as quickly as you can from that feeder with as much distance between you and the theaters you can and that would have been my choice had it been an option but it was not an option for me because you cannot outrun a bullet in a motel room right so I was not armed my secretary was not armed the only person who I knew for sure it was armed with a Nighthawk and you can see his gun right there and I didn't know if if mr. Kelly had a weapon up under his suit jacket or not all I knew was I don't want to die today so I chose the fourth option which was to do a preemptive strike you get them before they get you so when I fell out of my chair I was like. I'll go to grab mr. Kelly grab the night off and slamming down to the ground and take away the Nighthawks gunwale oh it was going to happen that quickly fast son as a little too fast but I'm glad I hit the table cuz I'm looking right into his eyes trying to figure out like what did you do I didn't say one word to this guy but my eyes have locked with his eyes and hear my eyes I was shouting at him saying what did you just do well his eyes had fixated on my eyes it is a word either but I can read his eyes is not sending me what did you just do and then cuz we're No More Tears and she realize what it happened explaining it to us when it happened again the ice in the ice bucket has begun to melt on Jesus and the cans shifted them it wasn't just like a normal right now to be like I was just on edge absolutely I'm sitting there before me and in that hour is the tension in the detentions not being alleviated at all he's explaining everything to you easy telling you his theories you're being very calm and just letting him speak yeah but you are still so on edge just being across from this guy that that sound right because it came out of nowhere you know it came out of nowhere and I mean yeah you know the detention had had had be escalated all that kind of stuff as as we got more into the hour but I think you know we each world where you know this is not a normal situation yeah you know black kind of clan leader so each one was still a little weary of the other kind of thing but we were mutually respectful so then it happened again and we began laughing we began laughing all of us and how ignorant we had all been I won't say that this was a learning moment but it was a teaching moment and the running will come later the the what what was taught was this all because some foreign Thunder score highlight circle the word foreign entity of which we were ignorant that being the bucket of ice can of soda entered into our little comfort zone via the noise that it made we became fearful and accusatory of each other so the lesson taught it is ignorance breeds fear we should go since we don't understand all right if you do not keep that fear and check that fear turn will escalate and breed hatred because we hate those things that frighten us if you don't check that hatred it intern will escalate and breed destruction we want to destroy those things that we hate why because they frighten us but guess what they may have been harmless and we were just ignorant and we saw the whole chain unravel 2 almost completion the last component being destruction the stopped short of that have I passed across the table and hurt one of them or have a Night Hawk drone his gunshot one of us you know that that would mean the destruction fortunately I did not happen we did see that that whole chain unravel 2 completion 3 years ago on August 12th 2017 in Charlottesville Virginia they would just like 2 hours from my house on August 12th 2017 in Charlottesville Virginia there was a lot of ignorance in Charlottesville there was a lot of fear in Charlottesville there was a lot of hatred and Charlottesville and what did it culminated in it culminated in destruction when a white supremacist got inside his vehicle and drove full force into a crowd of counter-protesters trying to murder them he succeeded a ninja 20 and I am murdering a young lady named Heather heyer so that that whole chain is there if you want to solve this problem of racism we need to stop focusing on the symptoms don't worry about the fear don't worry about the hatred those symptoms by putting a Band-Aid on cancer you got to go down to the bone and treat it at its source the source of all this is ignorance parents can be cured ignorance is called education so you could see ignorance there's nothing to fear but you fear what you don't know when you killed it ignorance you know something is nothing to fear if there's nothing to fear then there's nothing to hate if there's something to hate there's nothing to destroy so we need to focus on the ignorance and we address it with exposure and education and conversation Bossier and education and conversation we spend way too much time in this country talking about the other person talking at the other person talking past the other person when I just spend a little bit of time talking with the other person</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> when they track racism over the last 100 years it's at a decline it's at a measurable decline but not enough what could be done to accelerate that decline what do you think can be done to sort of start start teaching students in elementary school and high school by Civics what do you mean exactly our country is so diverse now we need to learn about the history of everybody in our country and everybody's contributions to making this a great country white black Hispanic women whatever our our country is truly a Melting Pot and we and we need to treat it as such and give everybody credibility so you know this person you look different than me but he contributed something that I need out of different in hand but I can do something that he needs mutual respect for one another and Yoda Generations are going to die out but we have to stop them from proliferating their their BS to these younger Generations you know how we do this in schools where I went when I was in junior high school but didn't have any more right to have middle school now steps education was being introduced parents were freaking out oh my God I don't like it learning well guess what they don't want their kids going to school and learning about sex but yet these parents were not teaching your kid about sex at home either they don't they keep doing it if you don't let your teachers in school education properly and you're not willing to do it at home still don't learn it and where he where is he or she going to learn it out in the street and then what are you going to do when your kid comes home pregnant you going to be all freaked out so if you want to take said when I was in junior high school. It bring a note from your parents think it was okay yeah yeah okay and then you had like a little small class today is part of the regular curriculum kids today are better informed about venereal disease STDs Family Planning contraception and all these kinds of things because it didn't do no longer ignorant they have more information the same thing has the taboo on sex education has been lifted okay we need to lift the taboo on on on racism in schools and talk about it an early age how much time are they allocating towards teaching people how to accept diverse groups and how to accept that how to fight against racism I mean is that something that's talk it seems like that should be a Core Curriculum in private where I see it is mostly in private schools I don't see in public schools which is very unfortunate parents parents seem to seem to run the schools you know if it's if your kid for Snapple you send your kid to school and you find out your kids not learning what you think you should learn what are you do you take him out of that school and put them in another school and so I'm about to schools are very low to to just step on eggshells with parents another year they don't want to upset the thing or whatever but they need to the parents are not the teachers the teachers are the teachers well it seems and if you could explain to kids how people get radicalized you get explain to kids how what happens online how they draw you in what's the appeal of being a part of a tribe and which is a big part of write a big part of his being like a gang run same thing that attracts kids to games like everybody's in it we're all together it's like it's in a tight group run yeah me that that's gets people in and when they draw you in like they did if the kids at all is that s*** they talked about in 7th grade I know what they're doing mean just a little I mean religious institutions which would include synagogues Etc and you know I hate to get down on the clergy but I'm telling you they they are they they have accountability but they're not accepting and don't get me wrong I'm a Christian all the time stuff on it and I was a deacon in my church at one time but here's the thing whether you're Jewish Catholic Protestant Mormon whatever you have some form of Sunday school after you get out of the indoor indoor facility New York New York church or Temple or whatever and your Sunday school lesson it when your for 5 years old they teach you that we're all God's children God made a rainbow right and we accept that it for 5 years old and then as we grow older we can puberty and Adolescence whatever we move upstairs to the big congregation and I were sitting up there with the adults the the clergy the rabbis the minister the pastor the Rev whatever whatever no longer teaches that Sunday school lesson they stop saying upstairs We're All God's Children what do you think would happen if the revenue the priests were said the congregation one Sunday morning right and because I have not been continued that that Sunday school lesson needs to be continued upstairs so adults feel heavy in a while a rainbow with all of God's children but the priest is not say that or the river did not say that anymore because he's afraid of walking on eggshells and then stopping the flow of money coming into ties and offering in that collection plate it would be changing churches or firing him right and then your kid is let's say let's say let's say I'm Catholic and now I'm in 12th grade and I'm going to senior prom so my mom says So So Def senior prom Susan Goldberg Rob. Children we are exactly but it's not a god word but it's a man word yes if we believe in the concept of God and we are to believe that God did not make any exceptions in butts and mistakes instead of little loopholes he was perfect for the word to go but is a manward it's an exception God was Perfection man is exception all right so that's what happened you know if so so that's why the clergy does not continue that Sunday school lesson there for you to lose any money in other words they put they put money above morality and they should be held accountable well it seems like there's a lot of problems it's not it's not one thing it's not just the clergy rochesterschools it certainly the parents in a circle but the parents were taught so it's the parents parents it's the continuing to the egg whites but what the bid to inherited want one of the most the most influential unless you're a piece of course the most influential Authority in your life is your church everybody of the church at the kid yeah unless you're a theist whatever so that that that weighs very heavily but how do you know if the atheist then how do you reach the atheist agnostic a lot of atheist and an agnostic have excellent morals a lot of them do their the O they have a church is called ethical societies and before you know they that they don't believe in God it was nothing that I advocate but I'm saying that you think they know right from wrong and you find less controversy and and and racism and more except and these places that's just about ethics and morality more so than division why you have a white Baptist Church and a black Baptist Church was that all about the Baptist Shelby Baptist it's the same King James Bible you know what you know why aren't they the same lesson in Sunday school that they preach upstairs they're not concerned about 5 year olds David rainbow you know why because of four and five-year-olds don't have any money so then I can send then I getting any money in the collection plate there it doesn't matter it matters where the money is you you say what you got to say to get the amount of money that you need. So you know I don't go to church so that's an alien concept to me but that's sad if that's the lesson if that's the way they're structuring their lessons in a church or synagogue or Temple that that's how they the structure structure in their lessons to achieve more donations to churches yeah we'll look at them priests and preachers get in trouble always seemed to me to be run by Cult leaders that are keeping it together they're just keeping it together staying within the structure of traditional Christian want to believe in something yes so why not believe in the clan when I believe Ryan CNN whatever yeah yeah yeah it's Tribal is we have this intense desire to stay tribal but we got to consider ourselves the tribe of the human race exactly the human race that can be taught to people I can yeah I think what you're what you're proving and what you're doing by your amazing accomplishments of showing that that even in the most radicalized of people the KKK and the National Socialist movement your can be taught people you can yeah I think what you're what you're proving and what you're doing by your amazing accomplishments is showing that that even in the most radicalized of people the KKK and the National Socialist movement your converted people</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> we claim to be the greatest nation on the face of this Earth I have a problem with that and don't get me wrong I'm a patriot I love my country but I do have a problem with that statement and I'll say that perhaps we are the greatest nation on the face of this Earth technologically after all we put a man on the moon we invented the technology to care that man to the Moon safely and allowed him to walk around get back in his lunar module and come back to earth safely we invented that technology not only that we was when when Neil Armstrong was up there walking around and made that famous one small step for man one giant leap for mankind quote we were able to talk with him live all the way from Earth NASA headquarters all the way to the to the Moon live via satellite radio phone we invented that technology Americans everybody you know has a cellphone everybody you know has email in a few words at a few numbers it send your talkin the people next door in Nevada or over in Africa China Australia where if you want to talk to anyone the face of this Earth we invented that technology so how is it that we as Americans can talk to people as far away as the moon or anywhere on the face of this Earth yet so many of us have difficulty talking to the American who lives right next door because he or she is a different color a different religion a different ethnicity a different persuasion a different whatever it seems to me that before we can call ourselves the greatest our ideology needs to catch up to our technology and you are so zap they're both of them up there then we can truly Brad about how great we are because we are living in the 21st century we are living in space h x yet they're still so many of us thinking with Stone Age Minds what is this doing in the 21st century what was it doing any Century but yet in 21st century you got to be kidding me it brings me back to what you were saying earlier that the problem is education the problem is ignorance right in the solution to education is ignorance and this is sort of the same thing when it comes to radicalizing young people online right the one of the reasons why that works at all is because he's young people are susceptible to other ideas because their intelligence immune system is very low they don't have a lot of data they don't have a lot of Education they don't have a lot of information and they don't have a lot of perspective so they can be stick be tricked the undie roped in and this is this is the same with everything this is the same with what you were talking about with not trusting your neighbor's cuz they're a different nationality or different color and not communicating with people that are any different than you and then being toxically tribal it's all kind of the same thing it's like there's a lack of understanding of what the consequences that are globally and in personally to your own life well again you know back to Mine mine's is going to help those young kids get to get those perspectives that will have people on there who are the experts and and stuck in those kids into into these are things I know a former jahadi a recruiter for Isis recruit kids to put him in ICU in the state's okay give him just scooped the guy from from the NSM he knew what to do with a national socialist so if you are willing to help on mines and help went out these different things you little telltale signs as to what they look for you know if so parents can you spot what's that doesn't sound right or it will it will it will apparently the people are really worried about people being radicalized online they're more concerned with that than anything else with video there's something about the compelling videos that are like the music in the video and yeah oh yeah the black population and this country was 12% 11.94% Native Americans just under 1% are Hispanic people Latino people doing 3% Asian 4% white people 84 86% so white people of the supremacist type mindset their biggest their biggest Nemesis of course we're black people at 12% too much I didn't care nothing about Native Americans did the attitude was I just 1% stitching on a reservation forget about him right and that's where these negative terms come from you know that don't realize or are insulting terms it when you say somebody is gone off the reservation that's not your cotton-picking business who pick cotton right okay so the biggest Nemesis if they were out that supremacist mindset were black people what percent is too much right now today black people will remain at 12% would not run for 2016-2017 senses we have not grown 12% Native Americans are still at 1% Asians are at 6% Hispanics have surpassed us then I get 13% or something so let's just take 12% black 13% Hispanic Asian whatever that's 25% non-white this is happening okay and it's well predicted by 2042 which is 22 years from now this country for the first time in history will be 50% white and 50% non-white... that is a very hard pill to swallow for people of that mindset they're becoming unhinged and and distance. You know when I was there the day will not replace us thing right and white genocide and see what they're doing is he stepping up their efforts now because one of the main promises in this country or the main concerns is illegal immigration so these groups saying come join us and Mexico West Africa what are plenty of people here in this country right now we're here from Canada and nobody gives a f*** about Canadians coming in there exactly Canadians or or people from the UK or Eastern Europe in the median speak perfect English to they slide right in I don't want my grandkids to be brown well you know if somebody white or the UK visa for Europe going to be white but if they let their grandkids marry somebody from El Salvador or Guatemala or Nigeria or heaven forbid right having trouble so what happens is this do it the NSM can't do it I'll do it myself and that's when they walk into a synagogue or a black shirt okay these are call Lone wolves now we have intelligence agencies or whatever that could infiltrate some of these groups and get in there and get all the stuff in foil those plots you know gather intelligence but you cannot infiltrate a lone wolf it's only one person right as we get closer and closer to 2042 unfortunately when I see more and more of his lone wolves and that's what we have to watch out for the you notice every time one of these white supremacist types gets a busted and they going rate is home where they find a whole cast of automatic weapons and all that kind of stuff that's for the race war we're going to see more and more of his lone wolves and that's what we have to watch out for the you notice every time one of these white supremacist types gets a busted and they going rate as home where they find a whole cache of an automatic weapons and all that kind of stuff that's for the race war</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> now check out Martin Luther King we had to fight fight for decades to have Martin Luther King day was a lot of resistance to that do you realize that a lot of resistance was the fact that Martin Luther King is the only American man in this country to have a holiday all to himself and guess what he's black what you mean by a holiday Autumn self I'll be there at like why did it take until basically the latter latter half of the 20th century before people came to grips with the fact that he was in atrocious human being like when we were kids when I was in a little bit younger than you and 52 when I was in high school they was Columbus sail the ocean blue to the Santa Maria when you get older and you you read these missionaries accounts of the horrific crimes and we still celebrate yeah we sort us out we kind of are done celebrating around Columbus Day indigenous people's day now they should know so we used to have two white guys who each other holiday all to himself Americans were those guys used to have the mid before your time doing my time George Washington day and Abraham Lincoln Day one day I'll Presidents Day okay way too many holidays you have productivity is that with the man who has a hungry to himself is a black man and they can't handle it for the king and now we have to fight for decades to give this man a holiday when he gave his life to bring this country together yet we give a holiday to Christopher p**** pointed out was a murderer serial killer by Pillager a rapist of you who didn't discover a damn thing marketing never murdered and raped but yet we don't want to give him a holiday you know so is That Yo Gotti I've been saying this now for 22 years one of the things that will help us to to advance into the 21st century cuz we are behind the times we need at this point to get rid of black history month now I know little people listening to like freaked out what it was that, but let me explain all right for the longest time we needed Black History Month black history was not being taught in our schools that you remember when you point out a moment ago that when you were in school it'll Columbus was a hero looked up to him etcetera and then you go to college elearn otherwise when I was in high school it was not an AR test books that we had our internment camps for Japanese-Americans I did not learn that until I got to college the times okay so anyway wouldn't have black history what we had was called American history it might as well have been qualified history cuz that's all it was and and even in some cases wipes are being given credit for things they did not invent Apple places they did not discover but we knew we were told it home then said that but not in schools so we had to fight fight fight and finally we got one week it was called negro history week Carter G Woodson created that and schools had negro history week one week a year we continued fighting harder and harder finally we got one month but you know nobody will give us everything at one time right that do without this by little so we got that one month shortest month of the year right February 21st it was the birth month or two of Our Heroes Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln all right so we accepted that and then we stopped fighting and that was a mistake on our part we became complacent and I'd and now it's my belief that black history month has become detrimental to to us to all of us white and black I'll tell you why yes we needed it for we got nothing but here's the problem we only study black history in February and each February we study the same half a dozen people Martin Luther King Rosa Parks Harriet Tubman Booker T Washington George Washington Carver and one or two other ones by the time we get there half-a-dozen up our month is over. I block then let's move on yet we study Benjamin Franklin Eli Whitney Thomas Edison F F Scott Fitzgerald Francis Scott Key all year long with we're constantly reinforcing what they did all year long we never forget who flew the kite and the lightning hit the key and we have electricity we all know it's Ben Franklin all right but yet if you ask them kid in June cellular who was the Harriet Tubman on the bus with Rosa Park man has been no reinforcements since February and then next year next February it's the same half a dozen people all right so you're constantly and I'm not taking anything away from those people they were some of the greatest all right but you're constantly reinforcing that they're only six or seven black people insult country ever did anything what about the guy who invented the traffic light what about the person who invented the ironing board and so black discoveries and inventions have time for that we only have one month to take these things out of those months and put them where they belong Under the Umbrella of American history and teach them all year long that way kids get accustomed to this and learn that and they have more respect for each other love I remember when I was a kid Miss America BeautyCon the only two categories and was all white women black women were not allowed to join listen to compete in Miss America all the judges were white males two categories the evening gown evening wear and the swimsuit that was it women wear objectified there was that subjects you know didn't have talent didn't need to write an essay or sure what else they can do and just looked at and JoJo on that so black women with deemed not beautiful enough two of them to compete in Miss America plus they didn't want any white man judging a black woman in a bathing suit or whatever so black women began heading low self-esteem but they were told they were not as beautiful as these other women so what did we as black people do to elevate the esteem self esteem of black girls we created the Miss Black America beauty pageant to give them something to Aspire to and that work for a while finally Miss America the big one came to his senses and opened its doors I don't know the exact year but I guess it's back in the 70 sometime open the doors to All American women regardless of their ethnicity color whatever as long as they were American they could compete and since that time we've had with that more than one Miss America has been Black starting with the Williams and then Debbie Turner I think maybe one or two other ones does that time so now because Miss America has come into the time we can get rid of black Miss Black America we don't need any more right because the main one when are we going to come to American history when you get rid of black history month we just we just finished the first black American president what are we going to do if Obama are we going to put them in in the end of February February box cuz he's black the only talk about him in February and March or September black history put them in February</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> as soon as I got the picture I was like I need to talk to you like what you're doing is the saying and then amazing and very very unusual for someone to have that kind of patience and commitment to something like that and to convert these people and without judgment and to be able to rationalize with them in and talk to them reasonably these are my fellow American yes you know we all are we all in this game together and sometimes people get trapped in a really f****** stupid ideology and they don't date that there's a part of their brain that no stump is a private Brandon knows it's toxic and they deny that they ignore that they squash it and they try to avoid thinking about it and then someone like you comes in their life and you kind of like open this door and then how do you know that the tops of thing happens on both sides and I catch hell from people who look like me not everybody you know but there are there people who look like me who totally disapprove because you're giving me people platform. you cannot change somebody's mind by disallowing them to express what's on their mind right you know what that's the argument about deplatforming people online right right look in the argument the other way is that your radicalizing young people the argument as there's a lot of young people that would go on these social media sites and and they're impressionable and they don't know any better particular YouTube they worry about that because these YouTube videos they have music and it's multimedia drawers and with a really good narrator you can get people to play cuckoo this f****** Flat Earth movement right where is that coming from it comes from a few articulate narrators who put together these videos on YouTube where they're the only ones I get to talk so I just don't get the interject. That's wrong that's not I'll show you know it's like this look here's a satellite photo look here's a hundred satellite photos look he is all the satellites take pictures of the earth they don't get to do that so these guys they do have this long uninterrupted narrated video that makes so much sense you you listen to this guy's he changed oh my God the world flat I can't leave them f****** lying to me so there's hundreds of thousands of people that believe in the Flat Earth now because they've been radicalized because they've been converted by these multimedia things like YouTube this is what people worried about in terms of radicalizing them towards hateful ideologies as well radicalized that's exactly you spot on because you know we was until recently that we begin using that word domestically we know for a while they were only using it for from Middle Eastern type people you know when when somebody like dylann roof did what he did with his said he was radicalized issues yes but it but they but they had become what what allowed to become radicalized maybe those mental issues you know but but we don't we don't say vassalize when it comes to our own end of it so many different code words for example what do you call these groups of white people who go out in the woods and practice Maneuvers a survivalist survivalist stuff they're like anti-government paramilitary what are they called them exactly militias what do you call the same type of things with black people I didn't know they have them as more of a negative connotation malicious got a pretty negative connotation not a militant yeah yeah we had a new political party that came out of nowhere the Tea Party the Tea Party really enjoyed the Tea Party is gone now I think they were out by the time he would take back our country back and but that was claiming call and people get resonate with a certain of people that slogan started in 1954 with the plan 1954 when Brown versus the Board of Education desegregated schools you on YouTube find all this planned rallies with these Wizards dressing with a burning cross and balancing country back then the creation then what integrated right so I would have to pee party people why are you using of Clans loading and it's on and they're all that's not what we mean Austin well you don't say take our country back from who you don't take our country back to what you said you trying to say Republican rule okay that's fine why not say that right right the using an already used slogan the right take a case to those people right and he was thing last time I checked Bill Clinton with the Democrat Jimmy Carter with the Democrat where was the Tea Party where was take our country back and then all of a sudden quarter with a Democrat where was the Tea Party where was take our country back and then all of a sudden we're in the white house and they start screaming take our country back right where were you guys 8 years ago</div>

Back in the 1920s and then in the end of the early 30s how many people even in America in the 1920s more than that it wasn't even a hundred million million Indiana how many 4 that's f****** crazy so it's basically somewhere in the neighborhood of 4% of the entire population of the country was in the f****** client know that time it was called white supremacy because that's what they believe in you know this is our country we didn't call it the clan it was the plan but the ideology and a lot of history in 1865 a lot of violence a lot of Vino lynchings bombings in a dragon people behind Vehicles without stuff began happening and became a lot of baggage with the term white supremacy where a lot of white people did not like black people or did not like Jewish people they did not want to participate in this night writing you know Lincoln was a murder in Alabama either for for moral reasons or legal reasons whatever the membership beginning dwindling to begin dropping out all right it was too too violent for them this is white supremacy word became unpalatable and became negative so when the membership decreased they had to Rebrand so they changed it from white supremacy to White separatism I'm a white separatist people I just love my own laps and Juice should be able to have their own schools their own neighborhoods their own churches their own workplaces we should go to have ours that we would have to mix oh yeah yeah I like that idea sign me up I'm a white separatist and then they had to Rebrand next they call themselves white Nationals a white nationalist right now what is a nationalist a nationalist to someone who loves their country like the Patriot so you're a nationalist why do we have to say white nationalist here comes the violence the once again the rebranded and now they're going to be alright and I use a cliche but as they say A Rose by Any Other Name is what still a rose so you can call if you want to call it it's still white supremacy do you think that Charlotte was a wake-up call for Charlottesville from me because I knew that it still existed but I didn't think they would show themselves we like that in the age of the internet and walk down the street with tiki torches let me tell you something okay okay the rally there was called unite the right rally I know the guy put it on I know all the speakers there I know them personally what was your understanding as to why they were having this big unite the right rally I only knew of it peripherally I didn't know why they were doing it I just had probably heard it on the news or something like that and then when I saw the KKK showing it with those guys the Charlottesville guys with the Torches were those KKK or was it another white supremacy move on all of the above they had different unite the right all the different right-wing groups came right League of the South National Socialist movement different entities reason as to why why were they that were they protesting what was their reason for for for being there and Charlottesville I have no idea what the media put out was they had come together to protest the removal of the Confederate statues statues most of them were very cheaply made and they were actually put up during the Civil Rights Movement okay so that was not the reason why they had to Rally him that's what the media said okay anytime of the reason why they had this rally their yes there was some people who went there to to legitimately oppose the removal of those statues Robert E Lee and Stonewall Jackson whoever else but the majority people in there with Eric to start the initial initial steps of the race war that's right the race war the white supremacist have been predicting I've been preparing for a race war just like dylann roof response truck the race whether he said we went to that black church in front of the place I expected to find the guy who shot all those people and I El Paso he said the race war all right here here's what you want to occupy a piece of public property because you want to have a rally a demonstration or even he want to set up a lemonade hot dog stand it was going to be on public property you must have a permit right you go down to the city get an application that you don't fill out your name and state your purpose you cannot very well stay on the application I want to start a race war you would not get the permit all right so you you provide some quasi legitimate excuse my great-great-great ancestors fought in the Confederacy that's my Heritage I don't want you messing with it okay that's legitimate sign off your permit sir and now you can occupy that corner of 12th and Main from 12 noon to 4 p.m. whatever okay so that they went through all the procedure that they got they legally got a permit to have their unite the right rally under false pretense and right now to thins anybody who knows American history knows that they were also blacks and also Jews who fought in the Confederacy alright the black slaves had to fight for their slave owners in the South there were a number of Jewish slave owners they don't want to give up that Free Labor so black Jews and whites fought together in the Confederacy against blacks White Jews in the union my great great great ancestors were slaves who also fought in the Confederacy I have ancestors of what in the Confederacy my parents are from Virginia Roanoke and Salem I was born in Chicago cuz that's where my dad was working at the time but the Virginia is is was the seat of the Confederacy all right so there are black people today some Jewish people who honor the Confederacy they don't condone slavery but they honor the Confederacy because of their great great ancestors stay on her house so like to have I honor my ancestors however I don't under the Confederacy me personally or some of the blessings you want to do that that's your business I don't do it so and ironically ironically this is a historical fact the Confederate Army was integrated the Union Army was segregated and I wouldn't do me any sense okay so here here here we're fighting to free slaves and the end of the federal army has blacks and Jews influenza A and whites with a fighting together and the union title of segregated but it does because it's all so ridiculous with humans are exactly exactly you got it and whites could fight together 150 years ago play March together in 2017 wouldn't it make more sense and give more credibility to your cause if your calls was truly to preserve those statues why not invite descendants like yourselves of blacks and Jews to march with you in Charlottesville and said hey that's my hair is to leave it alone would that not have more credibility can you chat with you even if you only got five or ten right okay that's still what would lend some credibility but instead so they're claiming this is your heritage instead of inviting them in 2017 so it would not let them know I don't know This Is Your Night to unite the right okay if you have white white supremacist organizations so instead of including blacks and Jews everybody in that Heritage fact they were in the Confederacy of the South so instead of including them and they marched through the University of Virginia campus with your tiki torches and the streets of Charlottesville yelling and screaming and he's the medic and racial epithets what did I tell you that tells you their protest was not about Heritage it was about hate as everyone number to nobody in Charlottesville or anywhere else ever met their great great great ancestors who fought in the 1565 Van Born then right now you tell me but it's okay you do you keep it under people you don't know that's fine but how do you honor your great-great-great ancestors in the Confederacy and at the same time you just honor the very ancestors who you do know the very ones who raised you your father's your grandfather's and lucky enough you may have met your great-grandfather these people many fathers of these people Charlottesville many fathers grandfathers and great-grandfathers lost their lives fighting not in the Confederacy but fighting in World War II and who were they fighting the Nazis so how do you tell me you an honor your great-great-great ancestors and you want to walk down the streets of Charlottesville side-by-side with people wearing swastika we went to war against the Nazis why are you marching with Nazis and flying swastikas now now but wait cuz always what did the Nazis have to do without heritage heritage in Charlottesville Virginia in fat even in existence during our civil war was not even born during our civil war so what were the Nazis do it was about Heritage it was about hate and that's the media failed to tell us because it was the media did was they went to City Hall to join into the entire group was the entire group all about hate how many was there I would say probably about 95% people there we were about eight until there was a few misguided people that were there because they really thought they were protecting their Southern Heritage right and they were lumped in with all these other people that used it as a ruse to sort of set up his hate I hate meeting to have a permit how many people went there for that thing I mean there were there were more protesters of course as usual will you excuse my decide the booster tell you one number and the people there take another number the guy who was the the killer that ran those people over James Fields.. Guy scene 4 years old the epitome of a lost soul that got sucked into a horrible ideology was not very smart and that that must be a large centage what they prey on lost people and then they give you a meaning and a reason and Heritage to defend and then everyone had us in the status right in that bunch of crazy names like Cyclops Nighthawk know and I know Susan bro Susan bro is the mother of Heather heyer the girl who was murdered by James field that 20 year old boy threw his life away and it was premeditated Regions Field that 20 year old boy threw his wife away and it was premeditated on the internet before even going there and praised Hitler and so forth and so on and these are things you know that we have to be very much aware of</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> but I think like you know those moments you know I needed that I needed to to combine our energies in Allen because look how that fight ended up going you know I felt like like that that fight before the fight was to prep me for the fight you know and you know obviously I'm a big Underdog you know the it's in London massage he has so much history there he's from Amsterdam you know I don't know if anyone out there saw the video that Bellator put out afterwards where I said like you know we did it in and you can see how motional I was this is why you know and fast forward to when we're back backstage you know getting ready to go out there I always take my favorite book Think and Grow Rich from Napoleon Hill I always take that it's just a powerful book for my life I discovered it in 2000 the end of 2007 and it's just such an inspirational book I'm in really kind of like was the sort of the for a self-help books and all the other you know people that kind of came from that like Tony Robbins and things like that I like you know the the the motivating you know it like the secrets you know all those sort of things thinking go Rich was like the first and and anyways there so many quotes in there and things are just at stuck with me throughout the years and I love to read certain chapters and in when I'm backstage getting ready to fight and I have like highlighted senses and notes in it and stuff and I'm backstage and I open open book and I hadn't opened it up to this point on this trip like it was just with me putting my bag and you know I got a couple hours before we go out to fight and I always open it up and as soon as I open it it's on the other flap isn't inside in a chapter already last place I looked at it or whatever and first thing I see is a highlighted highlighted portion that says every adversity carries with it the seed of an equivalent advantage that was the first thing that I saw and it hit me right there it was like everything that I went through in this scam to get to this fight you know dad is going to be my advantage dad is going to be what carries me through this fight that that's my I know what I'm here for that's a great quote it's the best you know every adversity carries with it the seed of an equivalent Advantage another one of my favorites from Napoleon Hill that I've used on t-shirts and inside Aggie before Victory is always possible for the person who refuses to stop fighting you know which is that's martial arts right that's a black guy was Wipeout who never quit you know as long as you never quit success is always pause every failure just helps you learn and grow to to you know get to your ultimate objective ultimate goal and when I saw that you know right I booked and right now I Think and Grow Rich and appoint a lot to all my all my students all my competitors all my guys always talk about that book and and that was the first thing that I saw you knowing and like I said like going into this fight all I wanted was that fight like trying to get a prove that whole process was just like hey just give me this one just give me this one more don't stop me this short of of my dream you know my dream to fight for the belt to fight a legendary fighter like massaging someone that's been you know at the top or so long that was how I envisioned you know fighting for my first big world title in MMA and I mean I was going out there like the last fight of my life like it could potentially be the last part of my life you know and all this stuff with my health like you know what I'm thinking about my my parents and my family you know like wondering you know am I going to get hurt is this in my you know going to do something where it's selfishly where because I want this I want to fight I want this this title that something can happen to me and and you know to be healthy I'm not going to be the same and I'm gonna break their hearts out all these emotions and thoughts and and you know it's just like like I was literally kind of I mean and it's so to speak going out there ready to die like ready to just let it all out like this is it you know all I wanted was this opportunity you know and and I could feel how all of that was to prep me for the fight you know getting that we went through that fight to get to the fight and my dad to my corner and he's in my corner for all my fights I have the guys that went through everything you know those that last for five weeks before the fight to get approved with me and when I saw that I looked around at them and I smiled as the guys we're going to do it we're going to do it you know it was like it was Destiny and and I don't know you know if you've ever seen But I posted before some clips of my dad who is a professional organist or former professional organist but he still plays the organ he's a musician and when I when I walked out for this fight I I had them Play a clip of my my dad playing the organ and you know growing up when I first started training martial arts my dad was playing the organ at that time professionally and and that was that was what I did the time that I stay with my dad I was at church listening to him play the organ and then we would go to the academy and and we would you know we would train or we would train at home and you know my father's in my corner and you know this is this is our work you know I am who I am because of him I'm a martial artist because of him I have my brother's the guys have been training with Robert you know it was it was it was our destiny was family you know we were going out there and fight as a family and I'm walking out to my dad playing the organ and it would just really it took me to this place where is like I'm going to give everything I absolutely have win or lose I'm you know I'm not going to stop by me do my best my absolute best and and then you know the fight went the way it did came down to the 5th round you know that's where that fits around came from was whispered for them you know that the love that they gave me to eat to get me even just to get me there you know cuz I was ready to break man I was I was in pieces so many days in that can't be no it was just a roller coaster of emotions but having them you know my father my brothers behind me that's where that strength came from and and everything we went through before the fight but that's why I was so emotional in the cage and you get emotional anyways for a title fight but you know it was it was something else just to just to get their you known in and have that opportunity and you can really matter UCR I mean my UCR he he's right there with his hands like powerful moment right there did it bother you that he was here a lot of sour grapes after the fight gay guard did has my mom paying our respects give him a hug mean I understand that he felt bad cuz he lost but I felt like the way you handled it was uncharacteristic for him he was if we were so respectful before after the final went up to him in a before they made the decision I want to tell my sugars hand I said man of Honor you know so much respect for you it was an honor to battle with you you know I think them thank you and we shook hands and hugs and you know but then he didn't stay after they raised my hand he he walked right out we didn't shake hands again and then everything else you got really surprised me I think it was just hard to to Fathom because you know this was my 10th by he'd already had over fifty and he was a big he was a big favorite I just don't think you know he they were very confident they were very confident leading up to the fight I don't think anyone imagine me to walk out of there without belt special with one leg didn't know about it hurt really bad after I'm sure but you know I didn't feel like that's when the drones pumping you know I didn't it wasn't till like an hour later also cool rides pretty tight yeah he did that why do you think I mean he's lost before I've never seen him to sit tribute essentially tribute most of your success he was just accusing you of taking steroids and not a little bit of steroids you saying like monkey steroids that's what he said yeah I don't know you know his Camp Adam I feel like massages genuinely like when I would call you do a real martial arts he's a he's a martial artist and you doesn't really ever you know Trash Talk anybody and we were out very respectful but is Camp was they were saying and doing some things that were a little edgier I would say when we will do here yeah yeah when we classy when we were at the press conference and we were going on for the faceoff you know all is camphor always yell in a bunch of things and and you know when we're walking up one guy yells up to me dead man walking and of course a meeting on my mind I'm like I have this brain disease you know that you know may or may not be an issue here and in a couple days when we fight you know and and I have my family right there I'm like and then I have to look at them in the ice you know but I'll never forget that I thought about that you know dead man walking and I was just like this guy you know and it was a lot there's a lot to take in to step into that cage but I think maybe some of the people he's around maybe that doesn't mean that doesn't cause him to say those things when he was sitting at the dock at the table with microphone in front of them did you respond to that no I mean that was right when we were walking the faceoff in the priest press comes was basically done at that point so I have nothing to say to that you know that that person yelling that and you know what I mean after the fight when he was accusing use steroids and I never never had a a moment to you know I said we'd have another haven't had another fight haven't been never did an interview or anybody talk to you about his I know who was I did one Luke Thomas Luke Thomas interview with me I think it was no yeah it was before he thought Machida before he thought Machida he talked to me about it you know it interview about the fight and everything and you know I don't have too much to say other than I just felt like it was a little sad because there's a great fight you know it was a really great fight and Good Feet close by super close I feel like we kind of you know he probably thinks that he was under par and and I made a lot of mistakes too and I wasn't too happy about some of the things in that happened in that fight as well I thought I could have done a lot better but in a way I feel like we kind of brought out the best in each other you know his Jiu-Jitsu very much impressed me he was he was a seasoned Pro just like always calm and you know then when he had his moment he had his moment he started taking over you know and you know it brought up the best of me in that the heart that I showed coming back in that fits around and I just feel like it was a great fight and we should be applauding each other for our performances and you know I brought up the best of me in that the heart that I showed coming back in that fits around and I just feel like it was a great fight and we should be applauding each other for our performances and and all this you don't trash talking is really taken away from that</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> this is why you're here we're here to talk about that and I guess you should probably just explain what's going on well I guess I'll just kind of take you through the the events here you know that was my tent fight fighting for the Bellator title and in all my other nine fights previously it was never required for me to get a brain scan done just do to the to the different states that I was fighting at the time the commission's there and didn't require it in the US it's California New York and then Europe you know requires a brain scan we were originally scheduled to fight in January at The Forum in California the same event that just happened this past Saturday night and so we're going to fight 2019 at The Forum in January and that postponed Versace was injured and we eventually got rescheduled to fight in June in London so I already had a brain scan scheduled for December to get approved for that fight in January but I got the news about the fight getting canceled like the week of that scan a couple days before so I canceled it this I don't need to go get that done now and see fast forward you know I basically stayed in Camp the whole year training you know with that fight on my mind all the way from November when I started the first camp for the fight in January you know into the new year waiting for the the new date and it was March that that I got the word that we were going to fight in June in London and so you know basically training all year and I just pick right back up into camp and fast forward on into the very beginning of May I was going home already a good month into like the serious camp and I was just getting ready to fly to Brazil Curitiba to get into the you know the hardest phase of Camp I was going to be there for 3 weeks I had to get my MRI done you know what I wanted to get it done before I went to Brazil just to check it off the list so this was actually the week I had I had two good buddies of mine Jake mace and Sam Alvey were in Oklahoma training with me and we had a great week of training everything is going really really well and and it's Thursday and so I go get my brain scan done to get that done bring me to Brazil and I'm in there and you know where we get to the whole process and the Machine is done and it's not you know operating anymore but they haven't called me out of the room yet and I could kind of just sense something was going on so finally this you okay come on out and the radiologist with really no like no Candor or like an easy soft way of saying it was like dude have you seen your brain before there's some stuff in here you need to see and you know pulls me into the room and shows me on the on the screen he's like pointing out these you know look like little balls obviously look like something was wrong with it look like normal skin but I'm not I don't know you know Falls like like shades of you know discoloration like according to the scan itself like you could see that you know it wasn't normal and he didn't even know what it was at the time and he was like let me let me look this over tonight I have my paper and you know to get signed off that everything looks clear and normal and you know it he was just like you know he asked me if I had any concussions and if I've had any issues and I said oh no and he's like what this doesn't look right and you shouldn't be doing what you're doing I'm like okay so you're going to sign this paper and he's like no and he's like come back tomorrow and I'm going to give you some more information that's okay so I go back Friday and he tells me that you know he did some research and he believes that I have a disease called cavernoma and you know we kind of hit me with that I had no idea whatever number was and you don't he says look I'm not signing this paper you need to go see a specialist and get this looked at but as far as I know you should not fight you know you should not be fighting and then the next morning I fly to Brazil for my Camp you notes to go down there for the the hearts boring and everything that I like to do you know stuff we talked about last time and so I'm like I'm in the airport getting ready to go to Brazil for this portion of my can for this fight that is like the biggest fight of my life you know I've already waited an extra six months for it I've been trained for all year and at this point I'm like just in shock of what is going on my health and you know so am I Googling everything that I can about cavernoma and trying to understand what it is and basically it's a he's we're probably like I probably got it from one of my parents it's a it's normally a hereditary disease and your brain forms these extra blood vessels in these blood vessels grow and they can accumulate and sort of bundle up together into balls I'm almost like like like weeds or Vines you know they they wrap up together and these blood vessels are very Pro the bleeding now they don't believe so much in in a in a instance where you know they could cause a hemorrhage it's more like a slow that they use the term oozing effect so chooses Blood Out overtime very little little by little and as they accumulate you know those balls are very you know much more susceptible to to bleeding and reading about it while I'm getting ready to go you know I'm flying to Brazil I'm in the airport I'm taking off you know there's so many like extreme cases of this disease where people have to have multiple surgeries to get them removed you know seizures Vision issues people go into Comas and then of course worst worst case is even death and you know obviously Googling and you know not talking to a specialist and just kind of doing my own thing is not the best way to to get in for information and so I just have all these thoughts running in my head about you know what I'm dealing with my health in like okay now I'm going to you know Brazil to you don't train and Spar and and I have this fight and I'm right now I don't have anyone selling off in this paper you know is this going to happen what's going on like these questions and so I get there and you know at this point the only one that that knows is my girl you know and I'm confiding in her arms like talking to her and you know she's shocked and I've never had any issues I don't even really get headaches never been knocked out you know there's never been a time of my life where I thought man I should get my head looked at you know I think something could be wrong you know and so you know talk with her and then I have my coach Maddy Co he's my head MMA coach am I my teacher and he goes with me down to it so I could have Shiba and we train there at his brothers Academy Andre Dida Dida Academy evolu Sound tide and you know we fly Saturday arrive Sunday start training Monday and I'm just like I'm trying to train this first day and I'm just like what am I doing you know and I'm getting hit in the head and I'm like man am I slowly killing myself right you're like you know what am I training for at this point I'm not I'm not approved like what what am I going to do you know and and so we we talked it over and we're like okay obviously we need to get more opinions you know and I'm down to Brazil for 3 weeks I'm basically all of me the fight was June 21st or 23rd something like that and and so I'm spending all of May there so I need to see some Brazilian doctors some doctor down here and go to Cheba and so we've just begin the process let's get a prescription to speak Portuguese I'm not a hundred percent fluent but I can get around I can do pretty well on my own down there just from all the trips that I've done over the years so you know thankfully Mauricio his brother Dita they have so many connections down there you know being who they are and the history that they have you know teaching martial arts you know you get to know everybody and so they were able to make things happen quick for me we saw a doctor got a prescription for another MRI get scheduled to get that MRI done which happens on Friday the end of my first week there so I'm going that whole week training trying to stay positive but I'm wondering you know what up you know what am I doing what's going on you know what I mean like I can't I can't begin to describe the the thoughts and emotions that I can't imagine that as well oh yes yes and you know they go harder down there put it mildly yeah yeah that place is known for like some of them ruthless Killers to ever come out of Brazil 100% I mean 9% that's shoot the Box exactly I'm not sleeping well you know I'm emotional wreck basically I'm calling my Grove over FaceTime you know multiple times a day we're looking at each other on the screen I'm crying I'm confiding in my TV show and shine Genie Beto was also there with me I had an Airbnb with Sean so thankfully I wasn't on my own 24/7 outside of the Academy I used to always stays with his family and you know I'm just like man when Sean Sean she arrived that Monday or Tuesday and I tell him what's going on I'm just like dude I'm a mess right now like I don't know you know I'd I'm just so uncertain of of my health and what's going on and and you don't like man I just can't put into words right now but I'm trying to stay positive I'm trying to stay positive and we get through that first week get the MRI the new MRI down in Brazil so then we have you know the Brazilian Mariah to take to Brazilian doctors and so then the second week we start seeing neurologist and you know specialist to get there opinion and and see what they have to say and that was the hardest week ever because multiple doctors were all saying no you know when you look at the scan right off the bat it just like it it doesn't look good you know when your picture of it actually I don't have sorry I don't have one with me right now but you know what you just see these gray like little shades of circles like in the well I have multiple and most of them are very small like popcorn size and you know those aren't that dangerous at least yet but there is one accumulation on the backside of my right side of my head you know back here and that has built up and and it looks it looks big problems probably like somewhere between like a baseball sized like golf golf ball the baseball in between there it's it's pretty big but it's on the very Outer Rim so it's not like in the middle of my brain it's on the outside you know so if you were to go right through my head it could be right there you know you could essentially pull it out without having to go through too much stuff is that something that might actually have to happen no not at not now not now I'll fast-forward you know to the doctors I have seen here in the states who clarify a lot of this but that's what the Brazil all say the same thing will they're kind of just I mean you no fighting already isn't good for your brain you know what I mean getting hit in the head isn't good for your brain and I think just looking at it when you see it and then you know that I'm going to get hit in the head and when I do you're you're automatically going to be like hey you know there's already this extra bit of of danger that we're putting in to a dangerous situation let's not let's not play roll the dice you know it's not play that game and so we were getting multiple doctors saying no you know and even one was like you know they said that Jiu-Jitsu could be dangerous that's me getting my blood cut off like in a choke you know cutting off the circulation to my brain that could be dangerous and so this week I am a literally not sleeping at all I am crying multiple times a day and I'm just like man what am I doing I'm going into the sparring you know and I'm training and I'm not I'm not going to get approved I'm not going to fight you know and this is already been like a 6 7 month training camp at this point you know and it's for the Bell it's my life's work it's everything for me you know so I was just crushed day-in-day-out trying to get through and on Thursday of that week I'm doing MMA sparring and you know I kind of had it coming I shouldn't have I should have been going as hard as what I've been going but I was like trying to you know stay positive and stay ready like what if I need to I need to be ready for this fight you know some Saucy like I got to be at my best and in reality I was just training like garbage I was having my worst trait but I'm at work so I can't you know because of everything and on this day I'm in my third round of MMA sparring and I I strained my hamstring bad I go for like a double leg and the guy has a judo background he overhook like wizard Meme and goes for like a hoochie mama de her I goci type of throw I'm wearing wrestling shoes I try to drop my hips you know so he doesn't Elevate me and my legs my go straight in my foot gets stuck in the floor with the wrestling shoe and my hamstring just snapped you know like allowed like pop up and I just scream and I let go and I let you know I get thrown down and I'm just like you know he knew something was wrong with stop right there and my leg is just throbbing and I tried to get up I couldn't get up so I had to like walk on my hands screwed off the mat carried out of the academy that day could not walk and I'm sitting down the edge of the mat and I just like I'm a burst into tears and I looked look up to Medicine on McMahon it's not going to happen like there is no way you know all this is going on I'm not approved I'm training horrible my I can't walk now you know and so you know that was the end of week 2 all knows we have one more dr2c who's like the professor of many of the doctors that I already saw he is very highly regarded one of the best doctors in the south of Brazil Neuro Specialist neurosurgeon we were so lucky to get in to see him and you know cuz he's booked up booked up booked up but we managed an appointment time for Monday of the third week Monday night so you know I'm like a basically given up I can't walk I'm at home that whole weekend and Sean Jean he he had seminars on the weekend you know he came down there to support me to camp but on the weekends he was going off to teach seminars in different areas of Brazil and so I'm laid up in this Airbnb all weekend and I'm like just FaceTime in my girl and I'm like you know baby like I don't think this has happened I can't believe come this far you know to the title shot this much training you know for the camp like going from November of 2018 into the end of May of 2019 that was my that was it was just this fight with massaging and you know it took everything for me like the sounds funny but the the house the Airbnb the the host you know what she just like great host she left so many chocolates and all this food in the house like sweets and I just wanted to pig out and eat all these chocolates you know I kept telling Johnny bro you got to eat these things like I can't look at these I'm so I'm so much an emotional wreck right now you know and I'm in I'm in the the spot all weekend by myself and I'm ready to give up I'm like I'm going to go eat your ass got here you know what I mean and you know these chocolates and just like cuz I have to diet very strict to make 185 what do you walk around at around 2:10 to 2:15 is my normal way you know so I mean that weight is kind of normal like most guys at 185 or around 2:10 but I'm already tall I'm already naturally pretty lean so I have to be very strict on my diet to to get that low and it took everything for me to not just pig out and just like totally give in you know my UCL was just like hey we have one more doctor one more doctor the whole weekend all I did was just put CBD cream on my leg Brazilian CBD shout out to them and my sponsor and are using the MARC Pro on my on my leg to Mark bro it's like a like a TENS unit has different frequencies and you can go really deep in there so I'm just like okay let me just try to recover this thing as much as I couldn't train couldn't do anything I was basically stuck at home and that's all I did and I just said okay Monday night that's it if he says no it's done and at this point I hadn't told anything that I let my manager at now but we hadn't said anything to anybody else literally going with the new with my girl Shan to my TCL and Ed and so we go see this doctor Monday night and man right off the bat he kind of just because he was the first one to be just chill and just like okay what's going on what brings you here didn't look at any pictures didn't you know didn't rush it and I tell him yeah you know I got my scans it looks like I have a cavernoma for sure how do you feel the first one to ask me how do you feel and you know this is all a big huge shock on their had any problems I feel great and fine you know you know I don't even get headaches and he's like okay you know he talks with me and he's like let's go to an evaluation we do an evaluation and do some tests everything's normal like just simple like you know stand on one leg and all that kind of stuff you know and everything's fine and we go back to the office we sit down he's like let me just see what I can find but I guarantee I'm not going to find anything that says head impact or trauma is going to increase the risk of your camera cavernoma bleeding and so he starts looking up you know journals and and you know studies all the things that doctors have access to and he literally finds nothing there's no studies that say that getting hitting your head is going to make your cavernoma worse or or cause you to bleed and in something's going to happen he's like look you can bleed you know you can be losing blood and any point time little by little and it could become an issue at some point time but there is no treatment there is no we're not going to do surgery like there's no it's going to happen until you have symptoms until you show signs and because I can't find any studies that say getting hit in the head is going to make it worse and because you are you know a normal like healthy functioning person at this point I think it's fine for you fight you should continue doing what you do until it becomes a problem and if it does become a problem we'll go in there and we'll take it out the big the big mess and you know demo will move forward and so I'm just like you know I start getting emotional ready and I'm kind of like wow so you'll write a letter saying this you'll you'll support me he's like yeah sure sure no problem super calling guy just and he was the oldest doctor with spoken to as well most experienced and so we get this letter man walk out of that office me and Mauricio and we leave the door and we'll get to the elevator man I just I just like burst into tears I just I can't believe that there's some hope like this this can still happen and me and my used to embrace and just we both cry like a fat guy we got the letter we got the letter so I send a letter to Ed and we begin the process of trying to get we should get everything in the Bellator let him know they got the scans they send it over to the European commission that use an organization called safe anime and you know we kind of like we're happy were positive but at the same time I'm still not approved it's still not on you know but the letter is like that was the missing piece that was what we know to be able to move forward so I finished that last week unable to really move you know I can't wrestle I can't kick and my last weekend Brazil you know I'm literally just hitting mitts like this and I'm like okay trying to stay positive I still have like a month let's get this healed let's just keep sweating it's it didn't have any discoloration so it wasn't a tear it was like a severe strain the popping it didn't turn black and blue and so without that color discoloration I didn't I almost don't even want to know I was just letting you know like when it didn't really actually still feel it now yeah the whole way but I could stand so I could stand and all I'm doing is boxing now at this point because I can't throw kicks and I can't change levels to it to do takedowns and so that was a whole another thing because you know as I'm waiting to to hear back on if I'm going to get approved I'm only punching mitts like I might as well be doing like a cardio kickboxing class you know without kicks and that was the last thing that I want to do with massages just going there and box you know right that's not what I do right so the the hardships and frustrations we just continued as I'm dealing with my hamstring but at least we had some some hope so I finished that we fly home and now I'm finishing like my last couple weeks of camp at home in Oklahoma don't you come to Oklahoma you know Matty issues there and I'm trying to put together some great training one of my best training Partners from could itchy but his name is Chris Cristiano he can't Oklahoma as well and you know everyone's aware of the situation as far as my coaches MyTeam I did not tell my parents I I didn't want anyone to know I didn't want it to get out and so I was just dealing with it with them you know and and so we send everything in and we're waiting for waiting does this guy his name is Yanni he's on the commission with safe in the may he reaches out to me like after the first week and he said we need to talk and so give him a call and he's like we we got the letter were looking at your scans we've actually created panel of doctors to talk about this and at this point it's fifty-fifty you know I just want you to know we're we're unsure if we're going to approve and I just want you to hear you know I just wanted to touch base with you when you hear from me we see everything but you have to understand where we are still not sure so bear with us I'm like okay try to get through the next week and I had some decent days with my hamstring where I could shoot a little bit and work some takedowns but if I had a good day the next day I had to take it real life because it was just it was so tight so tight so tender massage 400 yeah how is you and everything everything possible I mean getting it worked on doing hot cold like you know I'm I'm pretty like anything out there that that is for Recovery I have probably at my house you know I'm big on really taking care of my body so I was just trying to be as smart as I could and just get through it and you know we come to this point now where the fight is two weeks away and I don't know if it's on or not you know what trying to put together is good training as I can stay as positive as I can but at the same time I'm just like men I need the yes you know I need to be able to focus now are you staying conditioned when you barely can use your leg man it was it was really hard I I was heavier I was walking around heavier than what I normally what would 4 for my fights you know by this time I'm normally below 5 in the 200 to 205 range that's where I like to get to just off pure diet not training and I was still to 10 to 12 you know it was hard like I couldn't I could box you know like a box hard and I could Spar boxing but without wrestling I'd I didn't feel like I was conditioned the way I wanted to be I couldn't Sprint I could ride the bike the bike didn't put too much pressure but I couldn't go call out the way I would like to make an airdyne yeah and airdyne everything was not the way it would normally be done now you know you're never a hundred percent you're always dealing with something you know I've had a broken nose before Cuts rib things like there's always something you know but but it was it was the stress of both in India uncertainty and if we would get the fight at all that was really hard and for sure that's why I got hurt you know that's one I got hurt but anyways finally on like the last day that they could give me the answer they gave me the answer and I got the email and it said we've approved you you are approved to Fight 2 weeks before the fight I held off on you know I'm pulling my family there you know I mean I have all my there's the corner coaches but have a couple of the coaches that I was you don't got to fly out there and I was waiting to purchase these tickets and you know when I had some other guys like hey where you staying what's what's going on like I'm ready in like a don't book anything just yet don't look at me cuz I don't want them to buy tickets to London and you know I'm not fighting and I'm trying to like be cool and not give anyone to you know too much of an idea what's going on and stay positive stay confident and everything finally got the green light and I early flying a few days later to London Eye we left on Tuesday and ride there Wednesday I got there like 10 days before so I have one weekend before the weekend of the fight and you know at this point it was like okay once we got that yes I mean we celebrated it was like you know that's all I want it I mean I'd already fought so hard just to be able to get to this fight you know and you know at this point it was like okay once we got that yes I mean we celebrated it was like you know that's all I want it I mean I'd already thought so hard just to be able to get to this fight you know</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> are you officially retiring I'm not officially retiring I am sort of I guess in definitely on the sidelines right now I am I am actively seeing more doctors and working towards learning more about this obviously I want to keep fighting it is gentleman in La dr. Wong's everything so he had done these operations on you said MMA fight I don't know if you operated on he mention boxers NFL players I don't know if you operated on them he had seen it in them and help them continue their careers and he keeps like a close eye so you know I need to get scans done at least once a year was yours that patch the large patch in the back your head was that particularly troubling to him more than all the other ones no no he is yes in because it's not deepen if it's not in the area where it could affect my my cognitive functions my memory things like that back there you know how I'm not a hundred percent sure they made it I mean he made it sound like nothing too important happens there it's more like Santa I know like the back area as far as what I've learned this far is more like everyday type of stuff you know it's not your memory it's not in a position where you could violently lose your temper or kind of like have like a a lapse in time you know where you kind of become someone else and then you come back like you know that all that kind of stuff happens more deep inside the brain where it's at on the outside in the back is just sort of like the regular stuff you know obviously want neither of us are neurosurgeons yeah so are you thinking about going in there and getting it removed no notice is recommended against why is it doing why do brain surgery if I don't have any symptoms that's what that's what he says and you know it cuz I was up for it I said hey should we just do this and he's like it'll probably be six months to a year before I would say it's okay to go back into sparring and things like that you know you're going to be able to walk out and be fine and do your day-to-day stuff but getting hit in the head for a while and why I mean it's a low-risk surgery but why take that risk if you're not having symptoms the the treatment of the Care is always just to keep an eye on it see how it develops and if you start having some problems then we're going to go in there and remove it but if you say that you're in definitely on the sidelines it's it seems to me that unless you get it removed apparently on the sidelines well I you know this is where I'm at now this is such a a rare and unique thing no one really knows too much and I'm getting some people that are saying no no way and then I'm getting these other you know specialist in people that really dealt with it that are like yeah it's okay I am like I said it's indefinite how why did I want to I'm 36 so you're in this realistically athletically this is sort of the last chapter known as The Champ trying to submit myself as one of the great Champs of this era and you know defend that belt as long as possible and you know say goodbye but I still have hope I still have hope that if I can continue seeing more doctors and getting more knowledge you know Andy Foster from the athletic commission is Right recommended another doctor to see I'm not officially declined for the California State athletic commission at this point Andy Foster talk to his doctor Wong who specifically says he didn't think it was going to be a problem no not yet no not yet but he recommended another doctor UCLA that actually used to work on the athletic commission that could be a big help and I mean this is I'm right in the middle of this so I'm just going to keep seeing more doctors and try to learn more about this and you know if it's if it's really unsafe I'm not going to get approved ever I finally got to a place where I can accept that you know and and I'm going to move forward on with my life teaching and doing what I do you know at home and and with all my students worldwide but but as if I'm still getting people like dr. Wong in the doctors on Brazil and I can find more doctors who have experience with this if they keep saying that they think okay then and I can you no have hope of getting approved I'm going to keep fighting for that where it where can you get approved what states go to prove you right now well that's tricky to know because you know as far as in the US only New York and California require brain scans and so that's you know a big thing of what I want to talk about you know or what I wanted to bring awareness to is like you know it all states don't require Skin So if you if you fight in those States you know it's to me it's up in your best interest to on your own if you have the means if you have insurance or whatever get scan done yeah what to see what that's what it looks like but I'm hoping that through this we can figure out if cavernoma is safe or not the more doctors I have looking at this and you talking about it bringing awareness to it that we're going to learn and understand more of this disease and if it's possible if it's not possible but I'm trying to keep the hope alive that if if it's 6 months or a year or even two years then maybe I can least get one more you know at least get one more but the thing is then putting me in the state that doesn't require a scan doesn't necessarily mean I'm going to get approved because these other commissions have a responsibility to speak up and say hey we don't think it's of his best interest you know health-wise to to compete and you know I'm not I don't I'm not I'm not against the commission I totally understand and respect that Andy Foster is one of the very best in the business he's so ahead of everybody else and he they they open up a time for me to come out next month and speak with him face-to-face you know and get to see the people that are made decisions and learn more and understand more of their position and when you know how they feel about it and I'm just trying to gather up as much information in the meantime would it be possible to do that with Dr Wang I hope so that's the plan and hopefully a few more that's that's what I'm working on that's when I'm in the middle of and until then I'm just going to keep training and trying to stay positive when you have a match with a Jiu-Jitsu match what has been announced yet but defacing mean it's about to come out it's less than a month away now February 21st I'll be facing Roberto cyborg in a grappling match in my good fellow yes yes probably in the neighborhood of 2:40 maybe a little more yeah we had a few matches the past and he's a great guy he's a legend as well like just you know one of the best ever for my time and it'll be fun that's what I want to do in the meantime to keep myself sharp keep competing keep training and hopefully get another opportunity but if not at least learn more about this and hopefully you know Inspire others to get checked out you know even if you're not in your combat sport you know we're doing anything risky just like the same way same thing you would do like to go get a check-up you know hey at some point in your life it wouldn't hurt get scammed on yeah you know it just really opened my eyes to how we don't know what what's going on up there and something can happen you know and you don't have an answer to it but if you knew what was in your brain maybe you would have that answer yeah it seems like such a tricky situation to be in because if you do decide to do something about it you really kind of almost have to do it now right because 36 with a full year off of no sparring at all or they said 6 months to a year so he would have to see you a couple times maybe do another scan see where you're at let's say six months or 6 months is like an ACL surgery not that bad right but a Year's like now we're in the 37 37 and 1/2 men and then you got to get real Tip-Top shape again if you really wanted to fight against funny I understand the doctors position why do the surgery if you don't experience symptom but most people aren't Fighters the thing is though it doesn't take away the fact that I have cavernoma like there's multiple locations and so just moving that one doesn't change the condition so the it's possible the commission's wouldn't change their evaluation just based on the scan with the the other areas exactly but the thing is though it doesn't take away the fact that I have cavernoma like there's multiple locations and so just moving that one doesn't change the condition so the it's possible the commission's wouldn't change their evaluation just based on the scan with you the other areas exactly</div>

Like how do you get us registered against taking down a hole and this is what I found the pictures obviously they look better on the Disco KO s*** I could see it from here wow dude that's crazy okay folks while I'm looking but you hold us up so people can see particularly this one drink layer as I don't want on the outside of the right is a f****** big ass spot on your brain near you can see there's a few in there that's the big boy all in all that doesn't look good and that's what I saw when I was on my way to Brazil going to train that would especially you're going to shoot the box I would freak me the f*** out and you can see the little ones that are around yeah they weren't too concerned of those yet it's the big one and a little bit of this one here that's more on the inside it's not big big like that one but I know all of these are outside of the brain know just something inside the brain on me that's crazy to look at man it's got to be weird looking at the inside of your head and seeing all the stuff that makes you you all your personality your memories all your skills on your knowledge all in there and it's got weird spots on it talk man yeah craziest heavy it's it's still having but I'm sure you put that on your Instagram well this is my my coming-out party I guess you could a dumb f*** man that spots creeping me out but you know this is hereditary thing that you the extreme ends or you live with this and it's never a problem your whole life the other side is it's a problem right from the beginning and you have to have multiple surgeries and bad things happen man that's spots creeping me out but you know this is hereditary thing that you the extreme ends are you live with this and it's never a problem your whole life the other side is it's a problem right from the beginning and you have to have multiple surgeries in bad things happen</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> that's the emotional side of fighting with emotional side of losses like when you see guys just weeping in their locker room and like remember what the hardest one for me was all do after McGregor knocked him out and he was just in his locker room just weeping like God damn that dude as a tough one tells you know that's that's going to stay like in infamy Forever by the worst guy cuz he's going to tell everybody about everything I want to cover it and about the way it goes a picture perfect punch to slides back when I was in the crowd and I was I was told I was getting the winner of that fight in the one that went down like that I just knew that wasn't going to happen so I thought I was going to get a rematch at and they are talking about going to go up to 55 my damn head yeah that the Aldo fight was crazy because I think that was the first time that anybody ever really disrespected Aldo Aldo was the f****** man for so long I mean the crazy thing about Aldo is he still only 32 years old Niagara talking about that with the Marlin fight when he was WC Champion a long time ago man ain't me to go back and think about what he knocked out Cub Swanson with that flying knee that was a long time ago that double knee and I'm the second one that's the last time you drove like kicking both our fights it's crazy because you watch his early career like watch the Urijah Faber fight it is one of the most horrific displays of destroying someone's leg you've ever seen in a fight yeah and so fast on men with no loading just now with no loading he would just just whip those hips and I will you know he was a soccer player like a really good soccer Riot UFC videos and play sock I see no jogging along and he's like a pro I think soccer players first of all their legs are so conditioned cuz they're doing all that they're basically sprinting all the time the running I'm running 5 miles again and they're going to blow out just he was like a whip those legs I wonder I wonder why all those stop throwing leg kicks I really wonder I like Wonder I mean he's had gotten something right you know you know it's a big issue with some guys like John Wayne Parr needs a hip replacement right now I mean he just has last fight he won in a boxing match and Toes is whole family he's just like he's just not like 35 to writers and I think she's like 14 now he's been fighting over the last year or two with a really f*****-up hit man like me has fallen apart man they like you got to have a hip replacement whole inside is torn apart night looking forward to the future man I have some stem cells my shoulder give it enough time to think about the stem cells is it really takes like 4-5 months before it actually I extend it starts healing things and a lot of guys like yourself mean you don't you don't you don't gather any done end of time it happened to think about the stem cells is it really takes like 4-5 months before it actually I extend it starts healing things and a lot of guys like yourself mean you don't you don't you don't gather any done</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> that's hilarious so well what's happening man you just got off of the Chan sung Jung fight and what's next we up to I'm go down 35 yeah probably like 56 right now mummy soap base legs and shoulders are so big but his waist is kind of small so maybe that's how he carries it so have you done a cut like that before I haven't been that but I mean my last fight at the you know getting down to 45 got down to like 44.5 and 28 and 1/2 / where I got to be for to make 36 and it was such an easy cut for this last time so it's your you're an interesting situation man because like you want a title at 55 and you didn't cut any weight at all and a lot of people like what the f*** man Frankie Edgar ua255 as you are so adorable like that was one of the craziest things about some of your fights like the Gray-Mane or fight that f****** a man who who wrap those fights Levine both of them now the first one the first one if he was Josh Rosenthal well put shout out to both of those guys time to let it go let it all depends on what all changes it's such a weird thing writes like the referees trying to help the fighter the trying to make sure the Fire doesn't take unnecessary damage but you know more than once you see fight stop we like I like I wasn't done right he was he was getting through a bad patch and that's part of what a fight is about it's like trying to figure out how to survive for sure I always want the benefit of the doubt you know I don't want to get unnecessary punishment of course but I rather get the benefit that has never been turned off even with Ortega and Chan sung Jung fight I got both those fights even though I got rocked in my other fights these fights I kind of was more coherent I'm not complain about stop this or anything like that and I could see why they stopped it but in the great fight scene the Benson Henderson fight where I got up kicked I don't remember any of those fights and I remember like three or four rounds of those fight cuz it was so wild the de Ortega fight I got rocks pretty good and I remember in my head saying I just short time left let's get through let's get through it obviously didn't make it to the end and you know what I did I remembered being coherent even this last one with it but Korean zombie I remember the ref saying you know you got to do something down there got to do something down there and I'll keep trying to do my best my body made for us to react knew I needed to be but yeah you know I never been turned off if that's a good thing or not but I know if it's a good thing either it's like people say if you get turned off it's better because then you your you don't absorb as much punishment or I heard that argument but then if you do get turned off your body gets turned off easier next time that's that's pretty true yeah had a bunch of fights we don't remember most of the fight like that that's a thing that a lot of Fighters don't necessarily talk about but it's a reality of hard fights with gray where evil thing was that the referee I remember fourth-round mark my coach Mark was like you know telling me we got one more round in my head on my one more round 3 and 4 I didn't remember at all and also I when I dropped me I rolled my ankle really bad. Sprint and I remember in the fourth round coming to if my ankles hurt men like what happened to I've no idea what I'm angle and Abel. Walking back and I was kind of you know I don't know sometime you get rock to get depressed for some reason I never said you going to the gym when you get what I got rock they I got a little bit of depression going on for some reason like what does it feel like when you said yourself and there's a video of me like that was a second fight nothing ever fight the third fight you stop talking but you won't write the f****** fights that you had with gray we're so crazy they were so cute he was so big is Big Boy man it's so big for 55 and you were guarding cut any weight at all wow that's crazy only just like f****** I'm a champ want to watch that one that's why I was like a champ why should I go down I mean I'm winning I'm beating these guys even the best fights ever super close so you know I could have went either way and but I just felt you know I'll go down now I lost two in a row here with me know what more can I gain from your let me go down to 45 and that's that's when I thought I'll do fruit for the the 45 how about when you think about it like if you had a chance to do it all over again like if you had to engineer your career all over again would you do it exactly the same way with your 555 you definitely would against BJ right yeah I mean you can't go back and change it all worked out for me and I got the world title I had a problem you know I'm back continuing to have a pretty good career there's always things you wish you could do differently you know I can't be like I was going to say I wish that things went the way they went well they went pretty f****** good change it all worked out for me and I got the world title I had a prayer meeting at continuing to have a pretty good career there's always things you wish you could do differently you know I can't be like I was going to say I wish it is forces that things went the way they went well they went pretty f****** good</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> yeah those coaches are like okay guys breathe I don't want my coach told me to breathe in the corner know how to Breathe by right said don't give good advice find some guys I think Mark got some flak for the Marlins fight or he was in the corners like your mother raised you but you no answer because he knew he didn't need technique he needed some motivation at that point was Marlon too big they lose too much weight to get down to 35 and was he depleted or was it so who do just steamroll them I just think the moment you know I think moral and hit him with some good shots and shots forward I think kind of just demoralize mall in a little bit like in Hawaii in my eyes to who do is not going to be able to take much more of the legs I thought for sure and I first found my dislikes not going to distance yeah I thought Marlon was going to keep dropping at the lake but Marlon let's who do close the distance and once you let so who do close to distance to get ahold of him start hitting with knees and I was like Jesus Christ yeah so who doesn't even like I mean he just wasn't even react with knees I felt like I felt like he was just depleted it seems like he didn't have the energy to fight the kind of fight that so who tows won the fight especially so who do at 35 right so who do I-25 is draining himself looking at but soohoo. 35 is much healthier and he has a wieners Minds away is the video that he makes pretty ridiculous a su marido SE come on bended knee I mean I guess that's do not have a stick now you know guess they do because it keeps him out there it's it's just it's weird cuz this port is part of that right it's like part there's his part promotion but it's also performance it's like guys like Connor The Perfect Blend the act like he's just just beat him himself the Conners some of these other guys man it's just rough forced and it's rough but look like Colby Covington Colby Covington it talked his way to a Goddamn title should he really didn't answer before he fought in Brazil but that's what did it mean that's literally what did and then that character just took off you go and look at the early versions of that character had a nice suits like you had a like a real crisp suit like Connor would wear but then later he's got these please not being easy but he's trying to clean his image of a little bit Cowboy think that's it maybe was Cowboys kind of easy to get along with and what not or maybe it's just that he's been dealing with so much you know what they could leave when I was in Vegas that f****** those Billboards were everywhere on cars and s*** spawn to the Bellator cage too but I also think I don't think he felt like he needs psychological warfare with with cowboy I feel like he thought from the beginning that he had a giant advantage over Cowboy if you go back to each other in half I think he just felt like this fight like I can just be a nice guy with this guy with khabib I think you felt like you had a talk with them I feel like he felt that he had to get khabib emotional the same when he got all the emotional but that's it didn't work that motherfukers up he's a vault you look in his eyes you just see nothing but Doom he and I he's with khabib I think you felt like you had a talk with them I feel like he felt that he had to get khabib emotional the same when he got all do emotional but that s*** didn't work that motherfukers up he's a vault you look in his eyes you just see nothing but Doom he and I he's</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> conspiracy theories that Connor through the fight or Cowboy through the fight with Connell husband and I had my cousins like I can't believe what people are crazy. Stephen A Smith and I like you alot but you're wrong Cowboy got Cowboy got f***** up with those shoulders in the Clans he had cars arms tied up and they're in tight spaces Connor dip slow and slams this bone of his shoulder into the nose and he's at the beginning of the round Connors up f****** super explosive guy super explosive all muscles f****** pulled tight the beginning of the fight and just he got off good shots and cowboy was confused meme flustered I don't think there's those shots maybe Rock them a broken nose and that kid rock I guess he's not breathing out of his nose now and then all the sudden he's like f*** my nose is already f***** up and he hasn't even punched me and you know it was it was unusual like I could see if someone has a peripheral understanding of the sport and you see that happen like come on man or even guys like Mike Bisping like Mike Bisping was like f****** shoulder strike dad said Mike Bisping is without a doubt one of the toughest human being has ever walked the face the planet like if he lost an ear but died in the war got them off on the wrong foot then Cowboy through a Kik to Connors arms and then Connor Conte County with a head kick Rock Cowboy the bad and then Connor hits him with pistons he hit it how do hard people could say it was a work he broke his f****** orbital bone yeah and that but Stephen A Smith said that he felt like cowboy quit he did not quit you got smashed their nose broke and and a broken orbital it's also you who you're talking about you're talking about a guy was the most fights in the UFC the most finishes in the UFC the most head kick Knockouts in UFC the most the most bonuses in UFC Cowboy is a f****** Legend he is a tough as they come he's lost before every human can lose especially if I do guys like Darren till and horny moms with off and these f****** animals he's fighting and Connor broke it finally broke his face he broke his nose and a broken orbital bone so so Stephen A Smith responded and then Connor responded and entertaining guy and is very knowledgeable about other sports this is not his wheelhouse and also that style of dismissing athletes and putting people. Like sometime maybe find what listen to him he's a fun guy to listen to me he talks great s*** you know but I wonder I mean I'm sure that's all players are kind of saying the same stuff we're saying when he's criticizing basketball player self or football players you don't even know I'm sure I'm sure and a lot of the tickets like the controversy is like good radio show for 3 hours is it after that so like all day long back in for the two of them yelling and arguing very entertained yeah that's his position all right I just think that this sport demands more appreciation more respect and it Demands a higher level of reverence to the athletes who literally pull it put their lives on the line I don't think you have to say that I quit to to describe describe what happened you could just talk about what Connor did that was so special you look the guy finds tricky ways to do things and those shoulder strikes like we've seen guys do shoulder shrugs before but we never saw anybody do it successfully but you got to think about the UFC is a lot of what happens in the UFC is someone at all these fights finally does something and then other people start doing that thing like you member when no one was throwing front kicks to the face nobody ever did it I don't remember anybody ever even a kickboxing people very rarely through a front kick to the face just wasn't you know they would keep right of somebody but they didn't even teach to the face was something strange thing you very rarely snap front kick with a ball of the foot now almost like an uppercut the way it comes off one of these two Justin Buchholz got RKO with it outside of the UFC the devastating Lyoto Machida did that jumping front kick to Randy code I I guarantee you now when people get tied up in the clinch and someone holding someone with double overhook for whatever I do remember how Connor had a hold of our Cowboy helicopter on the right over when I was over there when someone's tied up in the clinch you can't strike trike with the one there's nothing out there there's something there yeah it's I could see how Stephen Smith would not think that that was effective I could see but for me it was clearly effective they were hard shots there's a lot of power behind it is a lot of explosion Connor dipping his level and coming up and slamming into it was kind of crazy but even if you take that away the hike to finish I mean guy who Rises to the occasion the Cowboys had problems in the past with these really big fights and 1/2 he look nervous as f*** and he talks in here that so they're playing a video of him describing how nervous he gets before fight and how he is Rose up right on us. that's what I was thinking I was outside f*** he does not need to hear that that's what I'm in the locker room when I'm in the locker room and the TV is on what was like turn that volume down I don't hear anybody talking about my fight turn that s*** down good for you good for you when I see a guy in the locker room and I'm talkin I try to pop them up yeah I want I want to feel good need to hear that that's why I'm in the locker room when I'm in the locker room and the TV sign was like turn the volume down I don't hear anybody talking about my fight turn that s*** to good for you good for you I mean I'm cognizant of that when I see a guy in the locker room and I'm talkin I try to pop them up yeah I want I want to feel good</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> have any striking experience before that and none none at all by Boardwalk that's about it so what was it like going from just be straight wrestling to learning how to strike and Russell together it was it was learning process you know early in my career as able to take everybody down in those early fights but I had some pretty good fights in before UFC at 4 at the davidia East something davidia she was Ukraine Syfy. report WCVB some good guy so he was decent of they will take him down there for Jim Miller action my last fight for UFC and I was so we had a crazy fight so you know I had good opponents right away but the strike and you know I was always in the boxing growing up jerseys you know I'm not from the hood or by any means but everyone fights Ron from you know it's kind of like to see someone go to Seaside look for flights Joey Diaz talking about itself Jim Miller is a f****** beast he is a beast it was so glad he's healthy now because that guy struggled yeah so long with line to CMI my wife has it actually going down when I see 2007 everybody gets it in these crazy and it's just they say that we did this we look at this map online of all the areas in the east coast where Lyme disease is prevalent and how what percentage of the tip it's bananas it's it's my wife neuron acquitted too cuz you know she's had to go through a bunch of Dino treatments and what not and is it still with her right now it is it's not as much but she's got like a bunch of issues like autoimmune stuff I did and she's hot she's doing she's does the IV treatments to sunlight therapy so when I take the blood out running through UV then put it back in yet she's not a lot a lot a stomach feel better pajama think you changed his diet I think that was a big one just really starting clean yamo if he's pretty clean she's she's you know kind of holistic is Stipe person yeah the the Lyme disease things f****** terrifying because for a long time they were diagnosing it incorrectly like people didn't know whether what I'm is eat and people come in with all sorts of aches and pains and if they didn't have that big bull's-eye mark on them or the tick bit them the doctor really had no idea what was going on and some doctors didn't have a lot of experience I got it when I was young did you yeah but I had seen the tech so I got my medicine right away and I was fine but they say if you don't see the tech and then you still know you have it and then if you don't get eye medicine right away then you're f***** and send you a pie ever like it's not even that Lyme's disease it's the other diseases get attached to it disease they think that like you're imagining things cuz they would imagine they like fibers were growing out of their scabs and they scratch themselves like crazy but I had some good Insight we we did a television show called Joe Rogan questions everything and we we had some one of the conversations I had was with a doctor who has lyme disease and that's when things got interesting because he was aware of it not just as a person who has the disease but also as a doctor he said one thing that all these people that have Morgellons have in common is that they all have Lyme disease and Heath set Lyme disease is not just one thing that it's a host of other things are attached for Lyme disease like non identified pathogens and that some of them have some sort of neurotoxic effect that changes the way you see things so he was seeing things like there weren't there I keep seeing worms crawling around as I that weren't weren't even there when I went there and he realize like okay this is probably what more Jones is like these people are thinking that things there's nothing there but it's really because the Lyme disease and all the other toxins and pathogens that rhyme with it or f****** with your neurology to f****** with your brain yeah yeah my wife said brain fog is the biggest thing that that bothers her you know and she went through a period where she was always tired and it's crazy cuz my wife you would never guess that cuz she's super high-energy she works out everyday and I'll push it through that pushes through it Council Tree when people had chronic fatigue syndrome is all of his UFC money he spent treating his wife for Lyme disease he's a prison guard now when did the doctors didn't recognize to the doctors he was like I think might be Lyme disease the doctors didn't think so and his son started getting Bell's Palsy so fat half his face and his son was little things like for 5 half his face was going to have them my wife actually should help positive one time I think she got a flu shot she said and then came home to have Bell's palsy some of the vaccine was people were in this is including my managers dad took the vaccine and got Lyme disease from the vaccine that you got was the wrong one for whatever who was in the area ring from last year and then there's the new strain this year so it's not even really helping you while I think there's multiple strains each year and I think they're basically just had yet her background are guessing I don't take flu shots now he'll know but I I think they do work if you get lucky the right one, but I don't think that it always works in the in the in the flu shot case I'm not sure cuz like sometimes sometimes they just get it wrong with the wrong strain what do we know what we know I know it's hard enough for the shots subject anyway morons the government investigating the idea that Lyme disease was biological War are weapon that accidentally got released but this is through like legitimate channels they were investigating it wasn't like some f****** tinfoil hat job they release it on the East Coast I guess they wanted to really think it got out I think the idea is that somehow or another this disease had accidentally Escape their Labs or while they were in the middle of treating people is it ticked only way to get Lyme's disease I believe so I think it's deer ticks is that have a high population of deer also have a high population these ticks and then when people get it it's less you know most of them don't realize they have until it's too late so you don't realize you have it and then you missed the early rounds of antibiotics which can knock it out and then you get this chronic state like Jim Miller has your wife house and my buddy Steve rinella that had it he was f***** up I mean bad for free 6-month when I saw him he look like he lost and he's a slim guy but he looks like he's a lot headlock 20 or 30 lb and it was just said he just been dealing with the the Lyme disease is it genetic kill them I mean not kill them but just just really diminished because it's a weird because you you can't find anybody who doesn't know anybody who has it everybody knows a brother or cousin or wife someone has a mile of running Thousand Trails Lake in the summertime it's like Mandy's just some sometimes to get pics or my kids all my kids going out in it I think it takes 24 hours for it to set in so like once you once you do come back if you have a tick on you just have to remove every time we go in the woods with tank tracks how do you get him off you though it's like it's in the middle of your back by yourself House of Gold House to Howard off work so it's not improving but there are some people I believe that think that this is a thing it just would be very hard to do is with the end of the US House of Representatives Chris Smith New Jersey Republican New Jersey registration legislation directing the Department of Defense who claims the Pentagon research tipped bass viol weapons in the mid-twentieth century the amendment pass Smith said he was inspired by a number of books and articles suggesting that significant research had done the US government facilities including Fort Detrick Maryland and Plum Island New York to turn ticks and other insects into bio weapon created a disease and now everyone is yellow tablet because it's mostly out there that's what I'm a place in Connecticut if you heard of the rocky mountain tick and it's not kind of the West Coast version of wealth taxes if you like chicken and fish shoot me what is that in the first cases of it were there in 1975 goddamn government weapons that they were developing over there coronavirus stuff

		<div class="paragraph"> and so this strength and conditioning coach that you've been working with in the beginning or what give us a regular routine for you like what kind of ship is he have you do so we just started getting back in there literally last week so we took a little time off and I went and had a cast on so then I go to Vegas and and I talked to the doctors you know that you'll see Doc in those guys in Vegas and you know it's not broken you know it's just saw an issue with the ligaments you can see seen this right hand right here at the bottom you can clearly see the ligament and all working there but then here there's that bump in between so they don't come out as much and that's causing me I don't have I didn't I don't have the strength like you know being able to pull in this is a big part of my game is if I get around you I got a body like I don't care what you doing you just not getting me off right I just I've spent years just working on that grip to where you just not do not let me off until I let off and so now I'm not being able to do that but it's it's healing fast and I was in Vegas in there we can just cut the gas off and make you a hard removable one that I can take off on and off so I can shower because I was a thing you stuck in his calves for 4 weeks can't really shower with their you got to shower with your arm up in the air on your handstand stitches and you I got to stick stuff in there and and psychologically I started getting a little anxiety with it too cuz it's like I can't get this thing off my head doing everything but no fry and no fracture which is good news so I don't have to be out for too long did you send me the tape of like when you hurt her and training say it like so it's one of those things where you hit with the thumb hit it with my phone cuz you know when you got those big gloves off you know you can't really make a full fit wrap so your hands kind of in there like this so you throw a punch the wrong way or somebody comes into your wrong way it's like boom you heard it so I heard it at one of my gosh everything's going through my head I got this guy's been talking s*** for years and everybody in the world is telling me you have to kill this guy you can't be that you can't lose to him now I'm going through all this in my mind though I can't be that guy I can't lose tonight I can lose to that guy and then it's like then unlike it feels a little better I'm going hard so I started pouring boom right away hurt again in a couple times I almost cry and you're getting it taped up more but even so it is still hurting but then he gets to a point where I'm just tired s*** got to block it out you know 525 I gotta block it out so I'm going to dressing room and train everything's okay I block it out not even thinking about it and thinking about going to work when I get in there in first round I don't even remember this remember throwing it boom something's wrong and I'm just like I could play it off play it off and then Prosecco VIII you know he comes on and then he's you know he's doing his job he's fighting me okay you know but after that some point I never thought I'm going to lose this fight cuz I never think like that it's like all I'm not a loses fight even if it's something not going my way I just I'm going to death if I would like the score cards at the end of the fight or very close yeah I knew it was closed for the first time ever I asked my coaches did I win that round I've never in my career than that I'm the type of guy even when I was resting on the red type of wrestler who I like to run up the scoreboard I don't like these live and leave any doubt that I won that round I'm going to dominate around I'm going to make sure I want to in my head I know I want I need to ask for the first time in my career I went back my that we're not around that we're not around eye but I even buy me asking that I never thought or I'm not going to finish this fight I always knew I was going but I just like I was that I would not that I went that I don't know why I don't know how or what was going on in my head but for some reason I ask I was asking so I knew the fight was close it was a good f****** fight man it was a good fight the thing about Kobe has he tricks you into thinking he sucks cuz he's got a goofy suit on and he talks crazy and you know he wears a Maga hat and all that stuff but but that if you didn't see any of that if you just watch them fight the fucken put up a saint people allow you to Robbie Lawler I was like good Lord like nobody does that the Robbie Lawler I keep put up walking pace on him and just stayed on him like guys have wrestled him before Robbie you know like got a hold of them dragging down try to make it a you know what state you know try to stall them out that's not what Kobe did Kobe 2 stuck on him like glue and put that pace on them yeah I mean he really he really doubt he really showed you know like how good he is and I mean I give respect to respect no hater you know I know this kid to fight I know he was good I know you was tough and I know he's a competitor as well he's always been a competitor I knew guys I want wrestling teams with this guy you know besides Jon Jones I knew other guys you know that I'm good friends with that wrestled with him so I've always known that he was a competitor that he was going to come out and try to compete you know but I like I said I just mentally I think I'm just on a different level than these guys just because everything that I've been through that I've done in my life has shaped me into and I am the mentally I'm I'm just on a different level than them when you have to have that attitude I just I felt it I knew and I felt it even and now I'm so more so than ever because now you've got all the fans by Anil on on what he's got his fans you got everyone has fans that are going to talk s*** to make it worse that you had a close fight which is kind of crazy where is pretty f****** nuts mean you win a title over won the basketball toys of all time at Tyron Woodley and you just dominate him right if they get all the other guys dos anjos those guys you smashed and white mean that's you had a crazy run up to the title and then a crazy title-winning effort and then this was the first time we saw you in like a very close 5 yeah I mean he's a tough guy at the end of the day you know to make fantastic fights you got to have dance partner razor needed Ali each other and he was there right dance for an end to be honest with you you know if I didn't take too much out of him because each fight takes something from you you know internally so if I didn't take too much from him I think I might see him again to be honest because I like it's clear that we are the two best guys in the division and so yeah I mean I look forward to seeing them again I think you guys will see each other again stop in the fear of looking down yes the looking bad is just like hanging over their head I'm about to get knocked out everyone's going to laugh, because that's very great with me that's very rude I am Brazil oh my God I can wait for you to kill this guy I'm in Dominican Republic became speak English cuz they're like I can't wait for you to check and everywhere so I can imagine me going out there and what I was feeling I had to really I took advice from Richard I had to really make friends with that feeling that accept it I'll tell you what man after weigh-ins when Susie pay the Nigerian flag on your face and you staring them down and used big smile on your face you look so calm and I was like that guys ready to work for you were so composed at the way and I was like there's no bulshit there was no f*** you there was no no emotions you just had a big smile on your face yeah I mean it's at some point you get to the word it's no longer the talking like you got to sell a fight here and there you know this and that but I try to stay as true to myself as possible I obviously understand people want to be entertained and I'm going to do the best I and now I'm selling a fight without going too far out of myself but we're not when that contract is signed and I know that I have to go in and take care of business there's no more of that like I have to be myself I have to be real and this guy said a lot of things that were very very personal you know a lot of things about my previous manager you know a lot of things about my team my current manager you know in a lot of things about my my my family and my situation as well as far as my father that to wear it it really hit home to where it's the best way for me to teach you a lesson. Picone in there fighting angry I have to go in there being calculate like my normal self and really teach you a lesson because anything you say can and will be used against you inside that article was he I'm coming hope you're ready tomorrow I'm coming PC and so calm to hit a big-ass smile on her face, but but you know what I look at these guys I'm looking for more than just that like I'm reading his body I'm reading everything and he's looking at me the whole time and he did the best cuz I know he's a competitor he did the best he could to hide his fear you know and I was afraid to I'm afraid I'm afraid everyone these fights you got to be afraid but I make friends with and I'm okay with being afraid I'm not mad I am okay with that so I'm watching him and there's there's a moment if you see that weigh in video with the stare-down what year did you know after we stare down was there. And I watch them I'm watching the whole time just watching them he's doing his good job is trying to stay on me stay on me stay on me stay on me than he looks away and I just read his body I'm just like okay I know how worried he is I know how worried he isn't it weird let you know that your opponent is worried you know everyone's worried right everyone but you kind of see it yes you could fuc yourself in your mind that this guy is not even scared yeah I'm scared and he's not yes you can mind f*** yourself you know you know it's not even like everyone before I cage fight has to be nervous absolutely and and yeah it's weird because I'm I'm looking at him and I'm studying and I'm seeing the level of fear that he has and you know I'm I'm trying to assess the level of fear weather is it something I can deal with or something that it going to have no choice is very confident but you know I can see where a house Superior I was in there to him my level of fear and his level of fear I can see where they were at because in the end you got to be mindful of his level of fear as well because you are caged animals very dangerous animals you know and so I can I'm seeing them and that's kind of how the way he that was that went I watch that fight again the other day I was playing in the gym while I was working out like that is a crazy Pace like you f****** came out guns blazing I mean it in my opinion is one of the very best Welterweight Title Fight ever I mean it was epic it was epic. The pace I'm watching watching the little moment just didn't read his spirit I felt the spirit at that moment and I'm just like it's not the same I was saying like I'm going to hurt this kid's not the same but he's going to come out as going to fight but I'm going to hurt him no point in that fight that I think I was ignoring him when you drop them in the final round he stopped the fight when you when you dropped me so I can go down what was going through your head I was at, I'm heading now I'm heading to kiss at you know when you when you landed punch good you don't really feel it and so at that moment I was kind of clipping in my was connect everything I clipped him with what he was feeling the power at that point and I've heard him a few times before but everyone kept talking about is pasted pasted ms9 and I carry power all the way through out that's how I train the power is going to be the same the way I hit mess with my coaches Henry hoot and all these it's all the same it's not all tap tap tap tap tap. little bit of power here.... Yes I know how to do that I know how to mix it up like boxes do they know how to put a little bit into this distract you with this didn't touch with that I know how to do that too but I carry the power all the way through out to buy V around when I hit him with that I think I had them in the body and I hit her up punch I hit him with the right hand that stun him and he stumbled back and at that point I was in I was in the chest in the driver seat I'm like okay I'm feeling in my left foot bone that hurt the one they hurt him because I have not really feeling the punches here and then when I put that cannon on his face blown when he went down so I got to stay relaxed a relaxed we got time you know the goal is to get him out of here I'm not going to jump on him cuz I made that mistake before I dropped the guy now jumped on him going crazy trying to get him out of there and stay on just stay relaxed and I'm going to get a nut and at that point I was just in the you get to a certain zones will you see him coming inside is it going by and then I'll and the other one that he drives and I'm going to say okay did you recognize the something's wrong with his jaw bone there is no I watch the fight over in my coat in my corner told me that his jaw was broken I didn't even hear them I didn't even hear that were you surprised I know what I am saying is it was might have been an early stoppage but they use you if you watch that last like that 30 second before that you see the shots that he was taking like I hit him with that right hand bully stumbled back almost fell down then I was wondering if they knew that his jaw was broken I mean that stupid but if you see him take shots like that you just got dropped twice and now you're holding onto a leg and now this is just a earmuff you're trying to protect yourself and have no sign of stopping you know that's the referee's job to get in there and it stopped you you know and I know some guys like all this should have let him go to try to fire you should have let him get knocked out completely your this and that you know but it's a referee is not doing his job in protecting you if if that happens it's interesting that you said every fight takes a little bit out of you and that's I think that's important for people to hear because you know we've all seen Fighters and we go to boxing perfect examples of meldrick Taylor when he fought Julio Cesar Chavez vs meldrick Taylor was winning the fight but Shabbos just kept the pressure on a cat the pressure on was beating his body beating his body kept the pressure on him and then finally with the like literally I think the fight was stopped at 4 seconds to go yeah Richard Steele waved it off and meldrick Taylor stood up and he talked to him you tell him I wasn't a was out of it and they stop the fight another tale was never the same again it was never the same Terry Norris start the amount that he starts slurring his words it was real bad was like that one fight took everything out of them yeah there's there's some people don't really see me everyone's attracted to Violent everybody wants to see the violence they want to see you get hit I want to see you hit someone they want to see the blood you know but people don't see what this takes away from your spirit each fight win or lose it takes something from you like only myself and Colby Covington or going to know what that fight did to us now can I do it now and do it again next week I have no problem doing it yet but each and every fight takes something away from you but is it a balanced out more so for sure take a beating right but if is it balanced out by hard training and recuperation to he can maintain the exact same level or is every fight your like slightly less good than you were before but you're so much better that you still have enough leeway that not that as far as preparation in training all of that stuff yet that that account so yeah that takes takes away from you but I'm saying the act of actually fighting the fight from your spirit from your energy that takes away from you because all you mean like your ability to get up for it until your your your ability to up to fight another man your ability to that bravado to fight another person that that spirit that kills Spirit it takes away from you or any going to get add to it changes that spirit in some shape form or fashion absolutely does it is there's this video a while back I forget the fighter he was a wrestler turn fighter and he's like bleach blonde hair I forget his name but I think the video was caught on Faded Glory I think USA Wrestling me then put it together and had all these rappers on in bed you know Brandon slate rebelde login with my team a lot of different you know it was on that video and I watch that while I was training for the 2012 Olympic trying to make the team and that video stays with me change my mentality or how to think because you really put things in perspective because you go out there and you battle this hard match and you lose to this guy like Joe I want hundreds of wrestling matches I can't remember hardly any of them the ones that I've lost all her most of them why is that because someone took something away from my spirit somehow I remember he's the one they took something away from me like I can tell you really the fights out of one MMA fights I can really I don't really care that much about I went and I move on but the one that I lost o yeah I know exactly why I knew what happened on you know what happened in that fly I can tell you really the fights on one MMA fight I can really I don't really care that much about I went and I move on but the one that I lost o yeah I know exactly why I knew what happened on you know what happened in that fly</div>

Give me this whole Spiel cuz I was on I was on his show below the belt as well and we had this conversation right before the fight happened and she goes to shoot on I-57 you know it's a different game and Shannon and he knows and he knew with the fight that he knew the computers going to try to take him down to be remembered during that we went through five or six upon its members to do pedestal be somebody else will be there all these people. fight in the fighting someone like Aliquippa who's a f****** Savage that guy like he's so good people never never never gets the credit you deserve absolutely Savage and it just a gamer and so when you have to shoot on someone I know how tall is 5758 you know but it's a lot harder to get low on someone like that and get the takedown him so when I go tell him that fight inferior takedown that much your natural reaction is to drop your hands real quick to try to get the Ender hooks screw that right hand like a fastball to you at a whip so what he that's in all the years I've trailer them he's just learned what he does he drops and dips his head and comes back over with the overhand left of the overhand right and it Finds Its Mark he sees it before he throws it and most guys will just throw blindly he dips his head comes back up and he sees his shot and then he throws it it it's different in the majority of the time Atlanta and it Finds Its Mark he sees it before he throws it and he most guys will just throw blindly he dips his head comes back up and sees his shot and then he throws it it it's different in the Maggiore the time and lands and I've been on the other end of that s*** I'm quite a bit</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> phrases that these moments happen where something changes and Sport nobody goes off let's do that and then a lot of people start doing it like when Anderson knocked out Vitor that front kick to the face yes and it was funny because when you take MMA and you didn't remember what it stands for and people for the longest time like always just wrestle most of Muay Thai and it was wrestling they never went outside that box and then guys like Stephen Thompson in the cheetah came in you know now you see MVP but when you see these guys they're bringing in a different Dynamic that works for them they would do it their whole life so you're not going to be able to adapt everything that they do you can still a couple little things from them you know I don't know if you recall but I was like the first guy that did that little I used to use my heel to the your thigh walk for a week you know cuz I would just healing it boom boom boom and the fight was only the first round know it so you have things like that and then BJ Penn said with Matt Serra Master kept punching him right in the hip bone he's like like for almost two weeks because little things make a big difference I wonder if they got rid of that those kicks to the kidneys are the kidneys Hello Kitty kick you in the head is okay kidney the back of the heads illegal but when you roundhouse kick a guy in the head a lot of times you hitting your head around the back of the head it's not illegal stop. That's how you break bricks and you can't do that to a person and he basically just like and then Vargas Lorenzo it said he wanted to fight for it and John goes look let's just leave them alone as long as we can still do it from the guard we can still do it from any other angle that has a little bit of an angle this will be the day that's what's great like I don't know there's a lot of things I don't know about the actual rules and give one hand down I feel like I look for me I've always thought that you should feel need to head when you're on the ground like if I stuff your takedown I see only your head right there on all fours right doesn't matter if you're not against the cage the cage is the only argument against we didn't allow elbows on the ground and people like them the reason I don't like him is it just at the time it's Sean Sherk was the champ and I was like it was in a lot of movement it was like here and he was so small as bad guys in the fight was stopped and for the actual fan at home watching the fight not all fans like to watch blood good fight and so I felt like when they have elbow imposter up it creates more space Chris more space listen to just a guy do his moves as well as try to get back to the feet you know I can back out and try to go big ground pound there's a lot of things that you can buy them for variation in the ground but not elbows cuz you got cuz he stopped by a cut Washington and by knockout I would like to be able to use everything I think nice to the ground but also elbows I think everything. I just think that especially the need of the ground like you shouldn't be okay that you should take down and then you're safe yeah from one cuz you're on all four that seems crazy to me. You're not safe it should be the rest was forced to roll to their back to avoid the knee to get the f*** away it doesn't make any sense that you in the center of the Octagon you wouldn't be able to hold on and need someone in the head look on John Fitch one of my best friends came but to watch how he fought Roy McDonald like for the fan sake it's not a fun fight to watch like you grab the leg in the guys like pushes out lip legs out and then you chase them on your neat your hands and knees and you're fishing for the legs but it's just not a fun fight and also to it makes it makes it look like we're doing McDonald and then all changes if you allowed needs the ground and he's so there's benefits on both sides hits back at your legs back so when that happens that you've taken yourself out of the equation of really engaging in action what you try to need me in the head now you're engaging back into the actual I can grab you and take you down to a cage how about that I think that's the problem with giant basketball court sized matted area the World Combat League with Chuck Norris out of Rio and then the was it called the f****** meyerowitz the guy who started the UFC tomorrow it's a it's a weird name he came up with some weird name for the pit it like we was like so play some guys going to run a lot as it is an interesting thing karate Combat League or whatever it's called what is it called karate combat karate, karate fights and they fight inside this area but they have this elevated outside but this is just and upright isn't it I believe so yeah but was it's interesting to cuz they weren't pants but they're throwing low kicks and shedding their black belts on like it's like all right black belts on like it's like all right here this is a commentary on that their morphine that changing it to trying to evolve it but</div>

Other than being very aggressive maybe he had different ways because we didn't know and the guys are sitting at the bottom we first went in there they refused to leave so they stayed at the bus and all they would do is when you put somebody on them and then suddenly this guy came in this was supposed to put comedy in there and Barry crimmins the one of the guys freaking they'll any myself swing as you mention it like that comic right yeah I need what we didn't know was with and 15 and you do grape grape now I'm going to go up and take the mic after bus 6 minutes it was a joke it was supposed to be a tax write-off and one night of the week for Greek belly dancers where they were paid $200 so I was really an amateur but I remember watching there was a show in the upstairs room and then there was a small or downstairs room and then there was another time where they did in the Disco right they had which is a it is a disco now if it is just started up here and it was so confusing that you did on stage and just say</div>

started you I didn't start till I was 23 in the process of writing my autobiography right now which I've been working on pretty consistently for the last five years something that you know I really was doing it for myself in a lot of ways to have an understanding of the things that I've been through in the things that I've learned and processed and acquired over these years which is you know in a lot of ways it's been extremely rewarding doing all this but it's also been in very difficult very pain an emotional going back through all these things that happened to me in my childhood in my upbringing and things that I'm even to this day and still trying to process and understand a lot of and where would we go summarize all this you know I grew up in a lot of different places moved around a lot and you know my parents split up very early me and my mother and three brothers four brothers sisters you know we basically lived in somebody's basement for in the beginning and we're living on welfare and bouncing around from place to place and so much of that shut me down emotionally and you know when I was a kid from what I'm told that I mean I've ever really not much recollection of my childhood cuz I'm a block someone check this out and so it's been really difficult for me to write this book because I don't really have many memories I have almost no memories of that time in my life where I felt like a child that carefreeness of childhood in North had to you know talk to siblings and friends from back then and look through photo albums and slowly things are coming together and you know that that's why a lot of this has been play therapeutic but I was a fighting I've always loved boxing and was very intrigued by it and martial arts you know Bruce Lee was always hope hero of mine and but hated violence coming up I hated it but I was intrigued by it so one of a really good friend of mine that we live in Colorado for about a year to get into fights on a weekly basis in school and I was fascinated by it like such as like a week I was very allowed like weakness took to overtake me throughout the the the events of my life and I was very shy didn't talk you know was I was always athletic and that kind of thing but but as far as confrontation in that I'd like it just shut me down and I didn't like it upset me a lot and you know what people would be angry with me and so is I had this this strange Dynamic where I was drawn to fighting and I was drawn to violence and but if I also hated it a lot and was scared by it but but over the years you know I thought about I was like, don't try boxing one day and I'll be really cool Lino's fascinated watching two people in the ring and then all these people are watching in there there with each other what other so fat their skill level and then you know what just thinking about what would it must be like in there to do that you know and fascinating me but it again like I said a lot of martial art why wouldn't be able to kick people I want to be able to the Elbow people need people and I never saw any fighting that was like that you know what it was I was coming up and you'd see Taekwondo and karate and lot of Point sparring in that kind of thing and forms and you know even that I thought was it was fascinated but I wanted to fight like boxers did and I just never really saw anything like that in one day 94 is white to Vegas I was watching ESPN I like 2 in the morning and these two have Thai fights on once in awhile and this fight came on I got this next fight is somewhat I-5 between so and so and when that started I was immediately hooked it hit something in me that just like lit me on fire like this is everything that I've been looking for this is something so different and it just spoke to my soul and in fascinated mean we're going to do this that's going to be at it's going to be more time but you know for various reasons it scared me one I didn't know how I'd be able to afford it and I might even if my parents would even let me and you know coming up the way I did I was partying and drinking all the time even at that mean I started drinking was like 12 years old keep my nerve some shaking my money out my hands wood wood wood wood Tremor I want to be drinking a lot a lot everyday I would drink every day at work all day throughout the day a little bit night I'll just be pounded 40, that's all that I did drink everyday and how did you wean yourself off that play Switchfoot what did it is as I said I I learned about it in 94 over the years every once in awhile I see a fight and I want to do this so bad in 98 I actually started calling around gyms in Vegas I was like only if I'm going to find a place to do this in for me was one of those things or if I'm going to do it I want to do it right and I want to do it to fight and if I'm going to do it to fight and what is the the the fastest way to get there and was like I need to take 11 lessons I need to I wanted to learn from a tie you know in that was not to say I would like Americans anybody else can to can't teach you but I was like if you're going to learn you might as well learn it from the source and the only place in Vegas that top Muay Thai what are the only place that even talk more instructors was Jim and I called the gym went down and talk to one of the instructors and when he let me know how expensive is feels like to be able to do this and inform me I also knew that if I am going to go after this I'm going to need to stop drinking stop partying completely alter my entire existence I'm probably going to lose all my friends everyone's going to laugh at me I didn't even know how serious I took myself you know I was like I laugh at me when I say this you know what like it's in if you knew me back then you probably left fight a stupid the stupidest thing I could ever think of and one of my best friends mohey for whatever reason this one night we were up on the roof drinking and smoking weed and he we got to talk him just about life and he was actually born with a heart defect I can't remember the exact name of the disease that he had was in the hospital so is whole life use eventually going to need to get a heart transplant aortic that Maggie was asking me what do what I want to do when I got to the moon and back what do you mean what I want to do with my life and it's like well I always wanted to fight and expecting him to laugh at me about this he's like well why don't you why don't you do it you know I told him up watch old already I was 18 at the time then and all my fears and doubts and in all these things he's like you know if anybody can do it you can he's going to think you should and I really thought I was stuck with me is like maybe I can and in that moment you know I felt very motivated and wanted to do it but by jerking you continue to drink and all these other things I just put it suppressed it into the back of my mind and then about a year later he was in the hospital and he needed to get heart transplant a basically like you're going to be here until you get one don't think any of us realized how serious it was or maybe we just didn't want to he ended up passing away while he was waiting for the transplant and that just obviously devastated me to no end and threw that knife through my drunken coping outside I'm going to do this at my go after this dream you know my friend he didn't even get a chance to fail at a dream and I'm too scared to even try for no reason just out of fear that much literally my only reason not to do this other than you know financial and all those other surface things but it really just boil down to fear and I was like you know what I'm going to do I'm going to go after this for him you know he didn't get a chance to live on Miraloma live for the both of us but you know fortunately his his death sent me even harder down that downward spiral of alcohol and depression and three years later I just had a realization one day as if he was still alive the f*** out of me for wasting my life I've been wasting my life for 21 years because of afraid you know I'm afraid and Emma I'm too afraid to fail to afraid of all these stupid reasons that that all of us give ourselves in order to make ourselves feel better about not going after things but really they're just that I just said they're just excuses they're just things that make you feel better and the b******* they're all b******* almost every excuse we have is total b******* cuz there's people with those excuses and with all those reasons and more and they're able than they do it like what is your excuse and it just it just smack me in the face one day and night I was at that point when I could not ignore it any longer and this was going into 2003 so I O psych made it my New Year's resolution to do this and you know play I was sitting down with my father and we have these to get into these long talks with me cuz I was always very quiet and you'd like to take me off to the side and his way to kind of talk to me and get to know me better and he's like so won't you tell me something you've never told anybody you know I'm like what do you mean like fight and very like while he's like I want to fight one day and decide what I want to fight and what do you mean you want to fight and you know I told him and he's like well why don't you and I told him all these reasons he's like well I cannot help you with all of your fears and doubts in this but look I'll make a deal with you if you quit drinking and dedicate yourself to this I'll take care of every Paula Financial things in order to let you do this all right yeah and well I was going to start tomorrow so you know I like two days later I got into the gym and alcohol though if you were physically dependent on it it was it was both extremely difficult yet I was so focused on this goal that none of those I had to overcome so much not just the physical dependence of the on alcohol but but my lifestyle and nothing's changed so many things but I've been putting this off for so long that I knew there was is no time for me to go to waste you know I was so focused on this to like once I made that switch in my mind like I'm going to go after this and there's nothing that's going to stop me in I've wasted so many years already that everything I'm doing is is going to be playing catch-up you know what that is there is no way for me to get to like I'd look at you know that like sanchayan guys like that and feel like I'm never going to get there so everything that I do has to be to get me closer to this goal and I can't allow you know my physical dependency or my doubts or any of these things slow me down because everything I'm doing enough to play catch-up you know and having that that Focus allowed me to overcome all of those those physical and emotional and mental challenges and of course that's not to say it was easier extremely difficult is extremely difficult but it was you got two choices you know you can you can allow these things to slow you down and hinder you and we can you or you can say I'ma go forward anyway doesn't matter how afraid I am it doesn't matter how hurt I am doesn't matter how tired I am this is what I want and I'm going to put everything that I have into this so that way when I'm done when my own my life is over when I can't do or I can look back and have no regrets that I didn't allow these things to slow me down I didn't allow the excuses that we all have hinder mean keep me from doing this you know because one day we're going to wake up and realize we could have gone after these things and we didn't because of X Y and Z but really those things aren't aren't anyting you know you stop and think about those MoMA when you first started this cuz that's a profound life shift and I to go from being a guy's kind of aimless and partying a lot but knowing that you should do something with your life to finally doing something like what was it like when you finally started training what would it feel like when you actually because you hadn't had you done anything athletic before that you know I was always act like my whole life is always really good at sports I hated I hated aspect of things I despise being on a team of any kind of I love playing sports for the for the love of it you know but anytime I was on like a team I would just hate it I despise didn't you know by the time I was like I think 12 I completely turn my back on anything team-related because I felt to me it felt like it just ruined all the beautiful things about the physicality of ovathletics you know it put this this this Marmot hindered me in a lot of ways you know and having to rely on other people you know it's always a big do you know it's like it doesn't matter how hard I work because this person might not have worked at all and you know that's why I'm so drawn to fighting because it's it's even though you do have a team of course it really is everything is on you the good in the bad there's nothing you can put you can point to all these other things but it's really just you so yeah I think back and I look back to what time and what was the first day like it was remember yeah yeah I do it was so I started out just doing private lessons I didn't even start doing classes until maybe six months to a year so I was I was doing private lessons on daily basis my trainer master channels one of toddies original instructors he had me in the gym at like 6 a.m. January in Vegas call Janine a lot of people realizing their Jim had no heat all the windows were like broken so there's no insulation or anything and I was I was just I was I was so excited you so nervous and you know obviously I want to do do really well and then perform and everything was just everything was so new that I didn't really I don't really have a lot I couldn't even really process it so there wasn't a lot of a lot of thought that was going to I was just I was just excited I was just 6 constantly excited and motivated and wanted to my whole goal was to fight and I was like I want to fight even if it's only one time so everything I did was with that mentality and I was like I want to get better I want to get better I want to do everything that I can and every moment and I put every ounce of myself into every second of the day was geared towards this you know was singularly focused on this goal the first day yeah I member the first day of footwork and yeah I'll man the first day the first day he has me up in the ring I must have been maybe the second or third day because there was another was other people there and that maybe they were just hitting the bag and stuff so they're there was a couple of the other Pro Fighters there are other they are pro Fighters I was nobody and I'm up in the ring and this is day one he's like shadow box I've never done anything fighting related like what do you mean like I don't even know what that is you know what I'm saying like a shadow box so like so much of my everything in my career has been like thrown into the deep end can you swim kind of thing and like this forced learning curve and I didn't get baby tuned anyting you know it's like all right shadow box go ahead and everyone always Fighters are like staring at watching me and like I don't know what I'm doing but whatever it was traumatic in a lot of ways but having to confront that in face that particularly me so naturally very shy person the person that doesn't speak ever to anybody I mean even now you know I'm still very quiet but if you knew me back then I was basically a mute you know and I had no interaction with especially strangers and people I didn't know any barely even communicate with so all of this was so foreign to me this is like an alternate universe that I was in and yeah it was it was it was so scary but it was like you don't have a choice but I get up there and do it or get the f*** out of here you know what I mean so there wasn't there wasn't time for me to really think about it or or like even be really nervous about it like do it shadow box like and in this instructor he barely spoke English is not like I can like sit cable I I don't really know what I'm doing and then maybe you can say like something's just let go and got to worry about your approach is like just do it I'm not going to tell you how I'm not going to explain the steps just go pick the bag or or hit it just do it and yeah it was it was scary but then once you got some momentum once you had a couple of weeks under your belt and the starter become real normal part of your life what was that feeling like we realized like hey I'm f****** actually doing this like this is actually happening everyday everyday I was taken significant Jones I mean as I said I've always been naturally athletic so I was picking this up like quick really quick I mean even within a few weeks people thought I'd been doing it for years you know what a lot of that you know does come from my fiscality but but my drive do it and intended to to have my sights set so high that you know it was taking these Quantum leaps every single day so over over the weeks and over the months you know it just it really felt like I was like oh I'm on I'm on track you know I'm I'm on the path I should be on I'm going to I'm going to be amazing at this you know this is great I am natural at this so you know I'm going to be one day I'm just be crushing people and you know everything everything was pointing in that direction you know with my my development and you know started eventually going into the classes in sparring and all those kinds of things and you know it's always like when do I get to fight when do I get to fight when do I get to fight and I think it was 9 months and I finally got I got to fight this is it this is this is my moment you know I'm going to go out there I'm across this dude and then I'm going to be you know on my way to take it to the big time not that they're even email back then that there's no big time there was no this wasn't this is before YouTube this is before anyone even knew what Muay Thai was you know you had to tell everybody you did kickboxing basically what does crushed my soul every time every time you say well it's like kickboxing or Muay Thai people to have to say that is stating it's like someone say was it's like karate no disrespect to any of these other Arts but but to say that it's that in order to help people you most the time I would just say yeah yeah yeah it's like you're posing instead of having to explain to them what it is and then I got the there was going to be a fight in Salt Lake City Utah and a bunch of the other people at the gym or fighting as well and we're all going to go up there Pete yeah yeah yes headgear but we didn't have shin guards we had 8oz gloves and we had needs to the head which was the trip so anyway so we drove up there you know like I said I really felt like I was on my way but when we got there the guy that I was originally supposed to fight with you backed out or it was just that he was closer and wait till somebody else you know when I was kind of thing back then we would just show up at places and be like yeah fight for me or don't you and they didn't and I was devastated now I don't have a fight and you know my trainers likewise is there somebody else yet until that that that that promote Arena was calling around come around and finally like what there's one guy that's going to take it but he always You by 20 lb and he's had about thirty fights already let's do it I don't give a f****** and all this for nothing that we came up under was you fight anytime anywhere anyone any style any weight it doesn't matter and so yeah I didn't even I didn't even really think about it as far as like that goes you know so I could fight that's an awesome man and I felt I felt confident in a way but it's also that you have no idea what you really doing in your whole life but if you've never fought you don't know anything anything you have no car what it's like to be in there you got the hardest flooring in the world with a complete stranger and it's night and day between a real fight and sparring and so it's like yeah you you you want to feel confident going in there but you have no concept of what it is so it's really just fake it's fake confidence and I got a f****** crashman so I got there and you know I've no concept myself or anything so I'll just like I'm like sprinting at this guy and in like 30 seconds I was done I couldn't breathe I couldn't think I could I could barely even see feel like felt like I was under water and it was it was the worst thing in the world cuz nothing this guy was doing with hurting me and every time you hit me up and all I wanted to do I can't breathe like all I'm really trying to do is not pass out right now and and I mean like physically I have been doing nothing but but I was able to last for a while and do a couple decent things in there but by the third round he was his battery may need me in the face and you know you did he just kept clenching me up and was just needing the piss out of me and there was nothing I could do and they finally stopped it in the third round I remember walking like I was I was walking back to the locker room everyone in the crowd was like cheering for me like Ah that's awesome man like a job good job Mike what is wrong with these people like I wasn't good that was so terrible this terrible and I was like laying in the back and Polly nor the place and my opponent comes in music do that was your first fight so yeah man I hate to see you in like a year or two so just the the impact I saw that you could have on people that that it's not necessarily about whether you win or lose that it's what you're showing their it's the hard that you show it's the the spirit that you show and you know I had like a day or two and I was like maybe this just isn't for me know I thought I thought that this was going to be so good at this I thought there was just going to like Skyrocket to the top and I got crash man I didn't even make it out of the fight maybe this isn't for me but I was forced to face that day 1 like do you want to do this regardless of how good you are regardless of you win if you if you can't win and maybe you can't be the best in the world do you still want to do this yeah fukin do I love this so much and me having to face that so early on was was was extremely significant I slept so many of the people I train with would go on these undefeated expect 1015-25 but inevitably you will lose and if you haven't had to confront that early on eventually you do most of those people never fought again or you're just like fosta mentally where they weren't able to overcome it but I had to do with it the first day and overcoming be like you know what that doesn't matter I'm going to wash my ass in gym. Make sure that never happens again and I went on to win like 1920 fights in a row from there yeah that was really a significant moment in my career where I had to confront the reality of this and you know that so much of a fighting is is as a perfect metaphor for a first for things in life like if you really want something you can't always focus on what the results are ordering the immediate results like winning and losing and all of these things hurt so much of that is just on surface Eagle level of things and when you break it all down like what is your why are you doing I'm doing this cuz I love it I'm doing this to improve myself I'm doing this because it's what keeps me healthy mentally physically spiritually and all these things and that's the most important thing and yes it was an extreme motivator to be better and you know not to let that happen happen to me again but you know really really made things that's the most important thing and yes it was an extreme motivator to be better and you know not to let that happen happen to me again but you know really really made things clear to me early on Mike what's important here</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you're very welcome it's really cool people let you know I haven't brought a giant heavy bag filled with sand that has the way north of 200 pounds for sure you know the the thing with Shin conditioning a lot of people do know they smack themselves in the shin with bottles and kind of stupid things like that really creating what you need to which is overall conditioning overall strengthening of the the bone all your Greeley doing is dead in little spots in your nerves but that's the worst thing you do without strengthening your bones or deadening the nerves but not strengthening the bone overall and if you're not doing that you're going to think your bones a lot stronger than it is but it can't handle the impact so with with a sandbag your your your cover and much more surface area and you know applying it in a realistic situation where you're able to throw kicks repeatedly at this thing and what you would you really want to do is do what you'd agree that it's causing a certain amount of pain but you're able to do this daily with with repetition because that's how you continue to develop just like getting stronger at anything you know it doesn't happen overnight you got to just do this every day just at the end of your session knock out a few kicks and then again tomorrow FAMU slowly and steadily are they able to go harder and harder and then and then develop the strength and conditioning in your shins so the ideas that you're making like a little tiny micro fractures right and surface area so you're hitting it all what kind of at once as opposed to like little spots which is what happens after something like that you looked Human Condition my shins and then they just what the f*** am I doing this stop doing it well the Thing 2 with with when you're able to kick like that as you can kind of slowly build up you know you start a little bit lightly and develop a little bit stronger than kind of create a little little bit of a crease and you know as you get going you your brain can kind of wrap itself around a little bit better and then you stuck on harder and harder and by the end of you know you're 5 10 minute session you're putting some serious weight then you're not you're not noticing it as much yeah we were talking about you or your knee that you had a fracture in any that you didn't realize you had yeah that's what this was really the thing that disturbs Me Maybe the most and kickboxing and so I've only seen it a few times is when someone checks to kick in the leg snaps in half and like Tyrone Spong when he fought go con sake or Anderson Silva when he fought Chris Weidman same thing that snap of when the the shin gives out like that it can event that from doing this obviously it's one of those just freak things that happens you know clearly with those guys you can have the most conditions in the world but you catch him the wrong way wrong time they can happen and it's rare but it does happen and it doesn't really matter how long you've been doing this how strong your shins are sometimes things just break I was wonder how many guys have little brakes and they don't know about it to buy a lot that's what happened with Anderson Anderson through a Kik and he broke it before that like you felt something was wrong and then we threw that second Kickin it snapped in half. That's why it did that make sense that perfect was checking it right at the top of his knee and you know that's a big thing with a lot of people tend to just blindly just pick their Shin up you know as opposed to paying attention to where understand that it's hitting just just like when you're kicking you need to pay attention to what piece of your leg you're hitting with which piece of your shin your checking with and the higher up on your shin it is. The harder it's going to be in when your Southpaw vs Orthodox and throwing that inside leg kick you or hear you're coming up with an angle which is tends to be like low on your foot or your your your ankle in your checking with high up by your knee so you have the smallest part of your shin connecting with the the hardest part of somebody else's and with that it's just that the one that tends to do that yeah it's a sin on skin contact is such a brutal thing like I think everybody should experience it once around pretty good in our brains that eventually you're going to get to a point when you just don't feel pain and it doesn't bother you but eventually realize that never happens you know it is better to get that out of your head now you know Muay Thai and kickboxing and anything that's bone on bone is it's going to be painful and that's part of the art of it you learn how to place your kicks better and pay attention to what you're doing and yeah of course you you develop your shin conditioning and in that kind of thing but it always hurts it's always going to hurt boxing in anything that's bone on bone is it's going to be painful and that's part of the art of it you learn how to place your kicks better and pay attention to what you're doing and you of course you you develop your shin conditioning and in that kind of thing but it always hurts it's always going to hurt</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I had to I don't hate you because I want to do this I'm going to toss a little hand grenade at you not see what you want to do with this year but I've been thinking about this a lot lately and then you know wanting to communicate my store in these things that have happened to me and then this opportunity came up in December to do it to reach a lot of people into there's that quote that says be the person that you needed when you were younger that honor walnuts stairs me in the face every day and I realized that I now and the person that I needed when I was younger in if somebody would have opened up their mouth and let me know that I wasn't alone in that that I wasn't so isolated and so many so many horrible things that we all deal with is because we feel isolation we don't think anyone could understand and we don't think that anyone else is going through these things in and if we did just that knowledge of not being alone would be so significant but when I was 14 years old I was molested by my stepmother and this one on for well over a year closer to years and it was obviously detrimental to me and these are these are things that I'm just now finally starting to be able to understand and didn't realize it like what happened to me and how young I was at the time you know when I meet of a fourteen-year-old kid you're bucking baby your baby you know it's like when we think about ourselves when we were younger like at least myself and like I still feel the same I did when I was younger I was just a little you know what I mean but you don't really understand how little you were until you have like a little 12 14 year old kids sitting next to you like you like how did how did that happen in like thinking about how so I stay with said one and six males are abused by the time they're 18 which means every one of us probably know somebody that this is happened to you know when to think how devastating it is to women but but it's it's it's such a different thing cuz you're almost as viewed from a woman being viewed as like yeah like it's a positive thing I couch that wish that happened to me when I was a kid like I want to be I want to be molested and you know we're not able to really understand it and understand that the damage that it that it does and and you know I die if I wouldn't have felt so alone and then so isolated at the time I you know I don't necessarily know if things would have changed but I definitely would have would have felt so alone you know when was felt like there's nobody in the world that could possibly understand that there's nobody that and who can I talk to about this you know it's like I can't talk to my friends a couple my friends thought it was cool s*** ever liked I want that I want that bad you know is how is ice very conflicted by it you know like I couldn't understand it at all and then to have this person like mentally manipulating me and making like it's not a big deal it's almost like it's a good thing you know like it's like there's nothing wrong but this really just derailed me so much and made me internalize and put up these barriers and walls around me in and things that I like I said I'm only leaving just at this age starting to understand like the negative habits that this created in me of distrust and both of you having to be having to be alone and not trust people and you know anyone in so many things like that that doesn't know what Gene is probably the only person that I've ever talked to in-depth about this I mean my couple people in my family know and almost none of my friends not never spoken to this to anybody try to go to a therapist once and talk about this but our interaction the night then I am like he's you know like a overweight person that needs how much self-confidence helping like allergies and like like who can I talk to about this and you know maybe maybe I can't talk to anybody but I am in a position to where I can reach out and let other people let me know that they're not the only ones going through this and then that has been weighing on me so much lately especially over the last few years none like you are in a position to be able to even if you could only helps one person that you can you just don't know how to make well I could write about it or I could do like a video blog or something and then I've been thinking about this a lot lately going to how do I how can I do this and like should I do this like I don't know if that's like a good thing felt like I need to express this and and and and communicate this in and maybe I can do some good for even one person and then if I didn't at that would haunt me forever I had an experience when I was 13 with a girl who lived up the street who's 21 a couple times but is very different than your experience it was a mean thing to say it was kind of fun you know it's it was different it was I couldn't believe it is very weird yeah but it definitely like kind of screwed up my idea of what boy-girl interaction was I didn't go from like thirteen-year-olds most the time they like you want to kiss or hold you poner tits out to the woman in around twenty one and it didn't it didn't hurt me like you our story like your story hurts like it sounds like you were betrayed and you were you were and also that the fact that was your stepmom and mean with me it was like what the f*** was that all about and I don't I didn't tell anybody I didn't tell anybody girlfriend when I was in my 20s yeah she was like when was the first time you were fooled around like wow because that was really the first time I had ever fooled around with anyone with his twenty-one-year-old woman I went up to it was the same thing for me and I didn't even kiss a girl until is I don't know 1213 like late late cuz I was such a shy person so I went from just kissing to that there was no in between I think I kissed her yeah I think she was the first person I kissed yeah yeah just have your innocence ripped away like that and to be thrust into this adult thing you know obviously you with the situation was that much worse if you know my stepmom and it being molested and it's such a different thing then a woman are being raped forcefully raped a different now but psychologically and emotionally you know it's it's it's it's devastating it is it is obviously and you were laying with her as well yeah the whole thing's terrible and you said it went on for a year longer than 2 years this was something you know I never I never felt right about this I was very conflicted by it you know nose like this definitely isn't a good thing I don't know why I didn't understand how bad of a thing it was very manipulative and then you know anytime I would kind of bring that subject of Academy think this is okay you know this is just feels wrong you know rationalize it or make it okay and you do FaceTime went on like I just like this is bad how old was she she was probably 30 young 30s you know now that was another thing I once I got to that age and then I saw a fourteen-year-old on my block like I didn't even conceptualize how twisted this person was until I got that age how could you how could you look at it baby a child and and do that how could you do that you know that expression hurt people hurt people and you know it and unfortunately a lot of that for me is helps you like rationalize it and make it to that go well with you know she's f***** up and you don't even even my father you do after you found out like he kept this lady around for a while yeah yeah divorce but but they taste kind of work together still in and he kept her around for for quite some time and you know that alone was extremely damaging to me and then throw such a betrayal in such a such a traumatic thing that I didn't even really understand how damaging that was after the fact until really till recently you know because I myself would rationalize it well you know he didn't want Nike be an a****** in like Center on like she was an alcoholic too and you know you know he was like all you know just trying to make this horrible situation like okay for all of us and you know I didn't really think about like a f*****-up he was in the whole situation in like how how much more damaging it was in the long run to me by not having my father protect me like if Mike this happened to my child out Trucking murder a woman did this you know I certainly wouldn't keep her around you know and I certainly wouldn't like just handle it handle it the way that he did you know when that was that was almost a magnified the damage that much more so because of the way that it was handled you know in to not have that cannot be taken care of by adults by Navia taken care of by my father by the people around me that horse posted love me and take care of me and in the end they did the exact opposite like the fuk fuk to my world up you know and I I put Band-Aids of alcohol on it my whole life you know in a minute and I understand like why I why I did that and then why it was I mean I really was trying to kill myself really I mean when you look at it that's what I was doing I was just doing process of it you know what that's that's that's what we do it's like we don't want to take the gun and kill ourselves but I'm going to I don't want to really live and I want to win like I want to check out of this place sooner the better so I'm going to do everything in my power to make it happen and that way I can't say I killed myself but I was killing myself everyday and putting myself some situations over extremely dangerous and detrimental and damaging and that's what I was doing and didn't half of my life wasn't so I was just destroyed and you know I'm trying to use this second part of my life to make up for that make up for the damage that was done in to try to turn a horrible situation in a negative situation is something that I could easily point to In-N-Out allow destroy my life which is what I was doing and trying to do the opposite you know what that again with it that the fight approaches like you have a loss you have a horrible thing happened you have an injury what are you going to do with it are you going to let it destroy you and break you never do this again and then be depressing bitching complain and whine about it going to say yes shity things happen to all of us f*****-up things happened and we all have the excuse to let it destroy our lives than to use it to make ourselves feel better about drinking and drugs and just being an a****** than me no like we all have reasons to be dicks and we all have reasons to you know take it out on other people but that doesn't mean that you should and that doesn't mean that you don't still have a choice it's that victim mentality in that this was something that I I just just started understand because you know that that term victim mentality of a f****** victim but would victim mentality really is his feeling like you have a role to play from that point yeah you might not have been able to control these terrible things that have happened to you but you do have control over what you do from there you have control over whether you use that to go into a more positive later use that to to drastically damage you in and you know be this burden that you carry sometimes I think when someone like you go through something like this and comes out on the other end what you can do by talking about this can set a path for so many people to understand that you know it was someone looks at you and I see you fighting on television and they they think they see you on the internet and you know successful Muay Thai Fighter and you know you look cool you have this beautiful girlfriend everything seemed so positive you know when you're young your life is s*** like mine was a clearly like yours was you you look at these people like they're nothing like you there aliens there there's some different thing they there their they're it's the world's opened up to them so easily can and they're better than you when someone hears you talk about your experience the alcoholism the abused the isolation the feeling like a loser and all the things that are so relatable so many when you can talk about this you can you you're you're setting a map that other people can follow and this is something that's so important in culture and in human beings were all part of some strange evolution of the human race and the things that our grandparents went through would likely I'm f****** believably horrific the things their grandparents War went through or probably magnitudes and this is just how human beings have gone from being monkeys to being what we are now and it's happening very rapidly and one of the things that accelerates this understanding of consequences and of the ability to rise to the occasion and overcome obstacles and to be able to use adversity as a tool to better yourself and someone like you what you're doing right now is very very beneficial to so many people millions of people listening to this right now and so many of them this is going to resonate with them they're going to say all this guy who is this f****** badass kickboxer Moishe's me my type by badass dude who's this like you know like people admire you and to hear this is it's so it's so powerful I mean it I'm so glad you said it I'm so glad you talked all of it from the beginning you know your your earlier struggles to this because this is medicine for people Mandarin it's so it's so powerful I mean it I'm so glad you said it I'm so glad you talked all of it from the beginning you know your your earlier struggles to this because this is medicine for people man there's a

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> hard because you don't get that many conversations with people where you disagree with them and it's not confrontational usually they're confrontational or you're confrontational so it always starts off in the bad foot I've learned how to do it from doing this podcast one of the most surprising things about doing this podcast is I learn how to talk to people better yeah I didn't think that was a thing I thought I'd just just was talking to people and then I realized somewhere along the way not only people list but sometimes I'm annoying how do I how do I do this where I'm less annoying and in learning how to do things are less annoying I've become a more compassionate conversationalist I got to understand how to talk to people better and I've gotten I apply it to my whole life now I've gotten better at it and I see people who are bad at it it's so frustrating like I have some really smart friends and you know I talked to them and they just f****** interrupt each other and they interrupt you and they don't let anybody talk you're not listening to this further time to talk and you know it's it's so strange they're not able to ever consider other people's opinions they think that everyone but them is wrong and it's you know it's basically like you know how it is when you see a YouTube video where people have no idea how to fight you see him fight you know that thing myself if I was in a street fight with this guy like this is I would be like why you doing this man this is so crazy you don't know what you doing hey are you crazy you're going to get killed you're lucky I'm nice but that's the same conversation there's a lot of people out there having conversations have no idea how to talk they don't they're not even really listening to you arguing to have one is using someone like a like a wall you throwing a f****** tennis ball off of bizarre statement on this room it's the more confident one that they listen to say more words communication and conversation that rental like socially dominate you and this for sure I mean I think it's a learned thing you know he's people do it to you and you go man I got f****** kick my ass. Conversation I might get better at kicking people's ass and then you get better at start a bulldog and people are talking over there were talking loud or having these days like these sentences that maybe could pull out of your ass every now and then to shut people down it sounds good and it becomes a sport really should be this is sharing ideas and communicating with people I mean if you really into the sport of just debating people and shutting people down and salty people okay that good for you but you don't like listening to that that much yeah what people like listening to fruit what I want for my experience is someone actually talking to someone someone actually expressing their thoughts and then the other person considering their thoughts and neither agree nor disagree but people are so happy when you could do that without real conflict some people on that I just five years ago I would have I would just said you f****** moron I would have screamed at them what are you talkin about you're an idiot you can go f*** yourself jump off a brick but instead of doing that I be like okay why do you think that and tell me tell me what about this here's what I think let me tell you what I think and tell me what you think oh yeah you think that tell me more but but yeah like I feel like I get the best out of people though that's how you understand who they really are but just for me is a human for my own education everything yeah you know I've learned a lot from talking to morons just just the awkwardness in the way they process thoughts and the way they view the world and the way they've chosen to communicate that you learn from that just like you're saying like it was sparring with someone is like doing has terrible habits you know people like that and that kind of thing but your ability to communicate in to bring out conversation regardless of what the subject matter is makes it very intriguing and you can learn a lot regardless of who the guest is like you learned so much from these people because of the way you are able to communicate with them the way you're able to bring out conversation and and get in-depth with all of these subjects most things and I'm genuinely curious about the way I think my why do I think that way so someone thinks different than me I'm genuinely curious like why do you think there's an instinct to go now you're f****** wrong I'm right but I do I just go I know what that is that's trick don't do that that's dumb don't think that way just try to find out this is not a game so I contest find out why this person thinks this way and it's better for everybody and I didn't even know it was the thing don't start doing podcast it just took me awhile podcast like anything else for me at least as I'm doing it I'm trying to get better at it and I realized I used to not be as good like I can't I never listen to my podcast but if I did listen to like the old ones from the beginning I probably these conversations for me or like it's like going school it's like everyday I'm going to school about humans we are going to school about whatever the subject there talking to me about but also going to school about how you know the more people you talk to especially like this no cell phones we're wearing headphones and is one reason I like headphones those cuz your voice is in my ear you're not over there you're right here man locked in and this is exactly the same way that other people can hear it which is a very unusual way to hear it yeah you don't think about it that way but most the time of your conversation your voice is louder cuz it's closer and they're over there and you're talking to each other and you know maybe check your phone or maybe you're distracted by other noises when you were in headphones you don't hear anything else when you and I were friends I've known you for years when will we have a sit-down with this they keep you from talking over each other too much to conversations are improvisational right you know you have a dance partner you don't step on each others toes you do occasionally just so you get better at it and it's more than two people it's mandatory like when you have three or four people in a podcast cannot do it without headphones or it's just talking over each other like I learned that doing those fight companion at least some headphone tours just talking over each other like I learned that doing those fight companion is everyone's drunk and they have the headphones on it's sort of at least comes some of the overtalk</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> that always trips me out as I think about like people review is lunatics I'm like what if they are seeing reality and we have blinders on you know because when you take into account what a finite percentage of what's really out there that were able to see without perception and you know it book compared to like X-rays and gamma-rays and all of these things like we have such a tiny filter on everything that's really going on out there s*** compared to what's really there in like maybe these whacked-out people are just seeing more of what's happening and that's what makes them nuts because that's the only demons flying around all these colors and we just have we have a filter on that so we can like process information and it keeps us sane but that's what's really going on out there I think about how small amount of acid you need to take to completely the way you view the world and I think McKenna describe this Terence McKenna described acid that the potency of acid is like it's literally like four in in terms of like the amount that you need in order to have an effect he made an analogy like an ant deconstruct in the entire Empire State Building in a matter of seconds like that's how potent it is in terms of volume human body and you're tripping balls for 7 hours you know that's a chemical disruption of this very delicate ecosystem so if your neurochemistry is off in any way up or down sideways screw we got too much of this or too much of that which we know is the case with everything right like some people born with bad eyesight some people are born deaf some people are born and they have problems processing pain they don't feel pain correct some people are born they must have an imbalance of the chemicals that are floating around inside you had yeah and their view of the world is radically different than ours yeah can ship depending on for your personal experience like a life abuse children that are abused their chemicals in their head as they're developing are off their different their brains are different a process life different because of abuse people have experienced extreme trauma violence when they're young PTSD they're processing things differently the people that have not yeah what's even crazier about that is I read a book called it didn't start with you and it talks about how these things are passed on generationally from like trauma your grandparents had is passed on to you through your DNA and it and it and it changes us like how much is passed on to us that we have no control over then Alters are the way we feel things we we see things all these experiences that people have that that that that that just get past passed down like that without any outside influence just just through that process of being year old is obsessive stop go to bed like you got to go to bed but that's me and I always thought it was f***** up I was like I thought I was doing this and I probably was my whole life to try to show that I had value because I felt like I was ignored and I didn't know my dad and I was felt like an outsider and a loser and I was felt like I would become about throw myself into things to show that I had value and I would get really good at things to show that I had value and that would be this absurd was like me trying trying to escape the existential angst of my existence and just as the constant anxiety in this just feeling of inadequacy trying to escape it by being obsessed with things but also trying to prove through getting good at things that I have value in the first time I ever felt like I was worth anything was when I started getting good at martial arts like then then people serve respect to mail so I can have the thing that people think I'm good at and now that I'm good at this thing that became my identity and if I just threw myself into that but my daughter's growing up with none of that she's all loved and she's all smiling and happy and she's not depressed she has lot of hugs and she has friends but she's a f****** psycho and I'm like oh you got that from me like you got my crazy Gene but you got it without all the f*****-up parts right or you're not sad you got it without the sad thing you just want to get good at stuff without like a happiness and also a feminine happiness to it for instead of a masculine like a grudge want to smash all I want to do I just want to smash things because she's not angry weird to see this obsessive like completely obsessive behavior in terms of like trying to get better at things and she accelerated she excels at so many different things that she gets good at she gets good at things and they become her whole life like all day long obsessive looks really weird but in a happy way and so it's it's strange genetically my dog Marshall nicest dog in the world right he's so nice that's a genetic thing that dog is a Golden Retriever and when he like when you come over to him and he starts whining so happy you want to get Pat and he runs and grab the toy always the only want to bring you something never had a rough day in his life every day has been fun but he's learned through his DNA that he's supposed to retrieve things and bring them over and that you are happier when he brings things over because that's the DNA that's in his system is literally inside of him from the box like right out of the box look at the ingredients oh he likes to bring you things they were awarded for it and said all they give me treats and they like me more when I bring things so I'm going to just keep when you know what you shoot a duck out of the sky and they get that duck and bring it over and everybody gets happy so this in him yeah it's understand what would DNA actually is or whatever form that are passed when two life-forms breed and then make another one I don't think we really understand it a rudimentary understanding of the chemistry involved but in terms of like personality terms of like or the thoughts that are in our heads like I was reading something by Rupert sheldrake and he's talking about why children are afraid of monsters he's like children that grew up in the city or afraid of monsters and not afraid of like gunshots in car accidents things are really scary monsters they were eaten by wolves and those cabinets were afraid of fangs and things in the dark when you can't see them, you can't protect yourself crazy crazy snakes or spiders where did that come from the stand name out of guarantee I've have seen out Fear Factor we had a few people that had a legit fear of snakes and spiders in Arkansas or something call my whole body was shaking and they were trying to f****** poisonous but there's something about snakes like someone they love or there is someone in their ancestry or something someone survive the snake attack something</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> free things in life we will figure out so late if ever you know when we were kids we look at the adults are parents some those in Authority that called they got it figured out yet you had a really good joke about this about thinking the older you get the more you you understand life and how things are going on but that the older you get really nobody knows what the f*** is going on and everyone is out here just winging it like I don't know what the f*** I'm doing I'm just kind of trying my best to my parents adult kids that don't the f*** they're talking about yeah the bit was remember when you thought that grown-ups were real they don't exist like I used to think that one day I'm going to be growing I was crying I was young I was so upset one day I would be grown up and everything's going to make sense and then one day you're at the supermarket and the guy goes paper plastic Sur North sir I'm a star a my grown-up and then you realize no one knows any more than you about what this is all about data on your head you might have more experience might be a brain surgeon you might know how to build Rockets you might be smarter than me but you don't have any f****** idea what this is no one does you cannot know you can because we could all be asleep in a dream right now or hooked up to a machine like nobody knows that for sure so how can you possibly say anything is factual you can say things are facts with the information that's in front of you but that information might be bulshit in 10 years from now how much they might have a completely different perspective on things that we're doing now that we think are right and like this the way life is that why the world is I would like 10 years ago people are very different approach to things you know and this is what we do pretty sure maybe not we might be in a dream like we could all be wrong and that's why I think it's so stupid to judge other people's beliefs be like oh your way is the right way you got it figured out and the everybody else is crazy but she's thinking to make don't you think that they think the exact same thing you do well there's a problem today and there's a lot of people out there giving advice and sometimes advice and then you get older and wiser and you realize that advice is really f****** stupid because you had its there's people that are giving advice and there was a war there there's like a lot of value in motivating people write when someone so like legitimately motivational person whether it's like Wim Hof the Iceman or someone is like really done some things just something about them that their inspiration is fuel its does something to you but then there's a lot of people out there that are just saying s*** cuz they think it's going to be motivating to other people and it sounds like horseshit that stuff is painfully prevalent there's so much of it there's so many people out there that are trying to offer advice and they're trying to motivate people but then you go Haven what have you experienced I said doll life filled with non accomplishment accomplishment is tricking people into thinking they're good motivational speaker get rich quick this is why this Pursuit is odd it's a f****** odd thing is the pursuit of tricking people into thinking that you're more knowledgeable than you actually are resonates with people is like what you were talking about from the beginning of this podcast will your talk about your life and how you felt and your own real legitimate experiences and the feelings of inadequacy and then defining the light at the end of the tunnel and all these different things that are just relaying your your life's lessons and experiences those are extremely valuable for people those are extremely valuable but because people know they're extremely valuable there's a lot of bullshitters out there they're trying to concoct these things and in trick you and like this how I got Smash Hit I guess the f****** Instagram messages like I see him like a want to come on the show motivate people I'm on my really about motivating people R22 the f*** are you motivated you ain't shitt communicating the full spectrum of the things that I'm dealing with and going through in my come only going to focus on these positive things like I'll just do this this than this and you know you're going to go the right way and often times cuz they don't have someone in their life like the way you were describing Gina Keebler Giant near life yeah they have people that check you have to know you to have to know you can't hide anything from them we have we have a lot of a lot of us tend to have these with the word b I don't know these people in our lives that didn't like they're only there because you're doing something for them mother that son of a relationship you're going to grow through that there that the relationships going to make you feel good yes and in a lot of ways and it's fun and comfortable it's like but if you if that person can't get to the core of you and really like when you tell me something I know it's truth because you have no other reason to to say bulshit right you don't know me you don't need anything from you celebrities when they go off the rails and they don't they don't hang out with other people like them so they don't have real friends they have these employees and people were in the kids real sketchy and everyone that they talked to and interact with need something from them and they assume this position of authority where no one can question them like no one can call bulshit no one like you got to appears very important the respect in the Friendship of your peers like man you're adrift you're not tethered you're out there in orbit just f****** floating around choked Donuts he'll tell you the truth and important than anything physical yeah yeah is extremely vital for everyone I mean particularly kids coming up putting kids into Athletics and martial law lot of s*** is a lot of s*** you can say by moving your body that you know you can't really fake that 90 minute yoga class is 90 f****** minutes it's hot as s*** and you're in there sweating your balls off and if you know you got to get to the end to the end up you understand what's necessary to get to the big things do it it's just it's a small thing that's a small thing you know life is a big thing with these small things you can do they all help you understand what's necessary to get to the big things and it's all macro and micro it's all connected in some strange way</div>

always looked at normal people living normal eyes I could never relate I never understood it you know I also grew up from a broken home and we were also on welfare and you know the whole deal because

it and then one day I realized I don't know when I realized it probably went like on paper ready made it such a place like this is not real like that you can't ever you don't make it no no one makes it yeah like it if everyday you have to be trying to do better every day you have to be trying to impress about there's no perfect human list except that you're always going to be flawed you're always going to you're always going to be subject to fits of rage and envy and and all the things that you wish that you would never have in your mind so you're going to come didn't leave you working to make sure that never happens and you constantly be working to make sure that you are always evaluating your perspective on life and always looking things from meditate constantly meditate make sure that you approach life with a learned perspective like you're a better person you were the day before and whatever you're trying to do whatever is fighting or weather at your do you have an art form that you practice whatever it is that you're doing you are trying to do everyday and you never even if you'll be able to accomplish them up like when you know you accomplish some amazing work of art that's just that day the next day you got to go back to work like if you have a world championship fight and you've trained for 8 weeks and you win by knockout the spectacular result and you're very happy with the result you got a day or two to relax you got a day or two and then you like f*** okay now what well you now you got to get back to work and if you if you think that someplace like a movie where you're holding hands with your loved ones in the f****** sunsets going on in the credits roll that's horseshit and we have this idea in our head that there's this place you can get to where you are quotes made it and I'm here to tell you that m*********** doesn't exist I mean obviously I'm not the most successful person in the world but on paper I've accomplished a lot of s*** and it doesn't mean a goddamn thing every f****** day every f****** day I get up and I'm like forgot to do this I got to work on this new bit okay I got it podcast today I got to be on point let me think about this let me read this book let me in on whatever the subject is when we get off and let me get into it have to if you don't you're you're going to feel like s*** yeah it's bad and that destination mentality play from that thing that I thought because as you develop your you the things that you think you want develop to that one day I would be rich but the Richie they did you get the richer you want to become well then you start filling up your life with these meaningless destinations right with your materialogic I want to f****** yacht b**** I want to chat do and it stayed they fill their lives up with meaningless possessions and they still are a p a Band-Aid to cover up the like what is the real thing here people I know that are f****** medicated to s*** all of them a lot of them more more more more more so than the people that aren't in a lot of ways medication for real but hard-working that can up get get done with a day of hard work and have a feeling of accomplishment and then go home to your family and get going again knowing you have to get up in the morning and do it again knowing you don't have enough money to buy a yacht but knowing you have enough money to put food on the table and there's a satisfaction to be able to provide that that's a better medicine well that's the thing that's why it's so important and vital to to travel and you know go to his third world countries that these people literally have nothing and are inviting to prep strangers into their homes and getting them things they said they do not even have themselves like why these people so happy why are they so at peace right because they understand what's important that it's not this materialistic thing in and that's not to say that material are bad but we view them as these these these objects hope of success if you don't have a good grasp of what's really important in this life and and unfortunately lots of everything taken away for us to really understand what those things really are you can appreciate some things you can but if you get really caught up in that you are trying to fill up a bucket with a hole in it and it's never going to fill up your always just going to look for bigger and bigger things try to fill that bucket up in and you're going to feel full of it I lie all the time chasing that there's no real there's no real satisfaction then that's why you know what you look at one of the things that people look at when you look at people that are extremely materialistic that you know where the the most fancy jewelry and drive the most fancy cars in the biggest houses we always think they're shallow Louis I mean isn't that funny like the saying that you would look at in terms of like markers for Success Marcus likes material things are the big ones ready for the big markers for Success the big house that that's the big one right now gas f****** mansion right I mean becoming a great fighter is hard but it's worth doing because once you do do it and you you realize like like there's an expression that I've used before but my Taekwondo instructor said to me when I was a little boy he said martial arts are vehicle for developing your human potential like many times explain it to people the benefit of getting good at the martial art go through this difficult thing and then threw that you reap all these personality rewards as you read these character award you reap his understanding of what you're capable of right if you are capable of making it through a brutal camp and it getting up in the morning when you know you don't want to that alarm clock goes off and I don't want to f****** run but you do it you go out and run and you can you do it everyday and you get through it and then you're successful and you realize that you have this incredible endurance because of the discipline that you put in you realize they have this incredible skill and it's understanding of how speak correctly because of all the time and hours in the focus you're a better person because of that right that's a real goal but that yacht you know like I'm going to work 16 hours a day so I can get a bigger yacht and then you know I need a house with bigger windows I need a nonsense to that like I'm not saying if you can afford a nice house nice houses you are the project your mind is the project how you treat people is the project how you you're the way you are with your family and your friends and your loved ones in the people you communicate with get better at that that's that's that's the goal in this life to go in this life is how we treat each other I know and I wish these were things that we were taught do know it's better explain its people in particular that you can explain it to people having gone through this horrific adversity and come out on the other end with a message and so other people that are going through some tough s*** do you got the Medicine the medicine is your you've actually experienced it and you know it's a map it's a map of the territory it's not it's not a f****** pill that you can take it all said everything's going to be better but what it is is a map of the territory and you have knowledge you can get through these woods and on the other side is a beautiful Green Meadow and there's a lake and its really nice horrible but I got to see first-hand both sides of money you know I went from living in a basement with a five of the people living on welfare to living with my father in a mansion and 200 all this money and all this stuff is just emptiness and and meaningless ending it doesn't necessarily equate to real happiness. Acquire we all chasing the so hard and I got to see that firsthand very very early on I don't want this to trick it's like the same reason why people love to play video games because they're difficult but there's no real reward professional video game player real reward you just get better at it and you get some sort of a sense of satisfaction and mean there's a there's something to be gained from it and fax some video games they've actually shown to increase your odds and if performance and other things similar to the way chest has but the Trap is that they're hard to do so when we see things that are difficult human beings are sort of puzzle and problem-solving oriented we see puzzle we want to solve them we see Mysteries going to find out that's why I was in the like Bigfoot and UFOs and chips. Mystery what is it what do you think it is like we have a natural inclination to try to solve things like that and we think that because in life look if you try to solve where the food is you survive that's what made us alive that's why our DNA has been passed down for all these hundreds of thousands of years our ancestors figure out where the food is you know they figured out how to drill a hole in the ice and fish they figured out how to you know how to survive in this is why the things that are difficult to do or attractive to us but we have to be able to differentiate between things that are difficult and meaningful and things are difficult and b******* yeah and he said so you don't have to worry about what something cost when you go to a restaurant bulshit looks like you're right have enough money to just get a nice meal at a restaurant and not sweat it like everything else is gravy yeah well you know the basic human needs are met you know food shelter doesn't correlate to any kind of happiness and in many ways is the exact opposite like what how much do you really need and if you eat the more you you think you need them the more problems you're creating and then in the more distractions you are from the important things in life and in and developing as a human being you know you're developing all these materialistic things but you're not developing yourself emotionally and mentally and spiritually and it is that I am chasing I think the study was like eight they said $80,000 like everything over $80,000 like you really don't experience any much more you know before that you're going to get until like 40000 30000 well-nigh struggling hard to feed yourself and then I moved to a better apartment and then I was sitting this better Apartments like I'm kind of used to this like I'm used to this like this is just home now is a feeling when you get when you're home I got them home now I'm in this other apartment it just cost more money yeah yeah I mean I guess it's better different I didn't feel different at all you know I might have felt different like when I go out to eat in the check comes I come I can pay for this kind of thing but but emotionally I didn't feel any different whatsoever and I think that's such an important lesson for all of us to learn and if you know what the early at the sooner you figure those things out you know the better I can pay for this kind of thing by but emotionally I didn't feel any different whatsoever and yeah I think that's such an important lesson for all of us to learn and if you know the early the sooner you figure those things out you know that better</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> motivational thing for me to try to be honest with the the things that I deal with the ups and the Downs in Mendon to to show my losses to show my injuries to show to be vocal about the doubts that I have that that I still have that I had to do was he know what's it is easy to look at these people in the spotlight be like they don't deal with fear they don't deal with pain they don't deal with doubt they don't deal with like they're inadequate I think I tore some of you were talking about that the Imposter syndrome it doesn't matter how amazing you seemingly are on the outside to all these people like we're all just human beings we are all just individuals that have made choices and no steered our lives in certain directions but but it's almost like when you make it to a point psycho they don't deal with this anymore the exact same fears doubts in in all of these things that I dealt with day 1 till this day I'd still deal with him those same questions they've never gone away ever going away you know you learn how to handle them better and you learn you stitch strengthened by them but but they don't necessarily disappear and then in a lot of times of the day they can get worse over the years because now you're now you're in a position where you're expected to be a certain way your people have people have expectations of you you know you you're supposed to be this super human being are we supposed to be extremely confident we supposed to only put on a plus performances and you're not allowed to fail you're not allowed to be human anymore and the when we can humanized these things and then I'm in it it lets people realize that they can do it to you know we're not we're not necessarily made up of anything different than anybody else you know we've just gone through list of learning in developing and Diving off of cliffs that we didn't know where they were going and you know that's that's what we all have to do you know like the people in the spotlights they're they're just human beings on the Maury that you you meet them and read about their stories and you know that's why I love reading autobiographies like cheese like the things these people if I don't work, they were handed anything isn't it more than anything it was more devastating detrimental had overcome more than you could possibly imagine it wasn't just given to them they had to work and strive and struggle and fail fail over and over and over and over and over and over and over again until they got to where they got to instill do they still do they still fail constantly we all feel constantly losses or these things that happen or the struggles has I always viewed them as challenges be like are you going to quit are you going to give up I was you like when I'm tired in the rain or in on a work at me like you want to quit you man you know that that that voice in your head you know that that that that devil that's looming over your shoulders like your failure but I'm like you know what f*** you like waiting I'm never going to quit never going to stop and there's nothing you can do so keep talking but I'm going forward is there a time will you ever get past that and you understand that you're never going to quit and instead just concentrate on the task at hand or do you think that that that voice that you're duking it out with that you take that motherfuker to the Grave you definitely take it to the Grave you I think we feel like we get farther away from it and we get stronger and we get more confident but it never gets farther you never get farther away from it like I I compared to my alcoholism it's like I could go ten years without ever drinking again but all it takes is one bad day we are all one bad day of being in the worst situations ever and that's why it's so important to know you look at people on the street to things like that but you know easy that can happen how many bad days are bad situations would it take to turn a successful person into that not a lot and I were all just bounce very delicate thing that you know it seems like we're all strong and safe and all this bag well when the power goes out and you know that the world's going to go to hell like that we just pretend like it's not your point is I don't think whatever any farther away from those things that held us back before we get stronger we learn how to process them and we we we under stand it more and we understand that the series of things that we need that will take us down that road or get us farther away from it but it but it's just right there you know and no matter how much we learn and develop I think sometimes it makes it even more scarier it's like the higher you get the farther you have to fall hand and it's the more you can be aware of that that that you're never going to get farther away you always need to be diligent that you always need to do things that are going to steer you in a more positive way I think that it that is like the goal to to not falling back on that. I think the worst thing that we can do is have this belief that we're past it ever going to happen again I'm not an alcoholic anymore I'm not a drug addict anymore I'm not depressed anymore that's what that's what's helped me is I I did think one day I would be so far away from it that we would never be a thought anymore but but by knowing that it's always right there that keeps me sharp you know it's like that. That you need that thing to keep you at your best or else we start to get lazy it's that that that same concept of having people that push you in the gym more in Life or or Saturday if you don't have somebody pushing you you can only ever push yourself so hard you might think you're pushing yourself really hard but don't really have a basis for where that is so like for myself I always run my Sprint on a treadmill because a tremolo doesn't lie this is how fast you're going in this is how long you're doing it now you can go out on the street and say I was going as fast as humanly possible you always going to hold yourself back a little bit you know that's just the way we are as human beings you know that that safety-net that we have ingrained in us to not go over that edge but if you're not pushing that edge you're not developing and you're always holding yourself back a little bit a little bit then no matter how hard you think you're going or or how honest do you think you're being unless you have somebody as a side so important to have people in your lives that that that keep you in that sharpen State you know that that that that that question you that. I push you and you know like like for me Gene has always been that way for me that person is like going to look and let me b******* keep me honest you know sometimes return extreme extension like give me a little bit of a break here but you know it's like that person that that pushes you and it's uncomfortable to be pushed in either you don't want to be pushed I want to relax I don't want to like sit on the beach and drink beers and then do all these things but is that going to help me get to a better place in my life a better place in my mind in my heart now that's going to allow me to just fight be a lazy piece of s*** and just and I envy no benefit to to myself or anyone else for that matter so as uncomfortable as it is to be pushed in as I'm comfortable it is to be pressured into 2212 Excel we all need those things you either improving your or your decline yeah it's like the concept of balance you never find because once you find it you lose it you always jumping on both sides of this line too much or too little rather going too fast or too slow and we're trying to find that perfect balance of everything and then you'll never can find it but knowing that you never can find it forces you to be diligent about all these things into constantly be trying to find it in the more you try to find that the more you're going to develop and learn ways that that aren't the right way find it but knowing that you never can find it forces you to be diligent about all these things into constantly be trying to find it in the more you try to find that the more you're going to develop and learn ways that that aren't the right way and then finding what what does work</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> just make me feel. I wouldn't just calling you a purple and blue is it just about like they don't give a fuk just as long as you're a real problem yeah I came out it was super cool nobody really gave me any s*** that's the best part about strong against you know you had Rob overseen here not too long ago and he's the one mansion you can still lift weights we don't care yeah that's it mirrors the comedy community in that way for sure like stand-up comedy community nobody gives a s*** you know the weight off my shoulders was was unbelievable what how long ago was this that was 2014 so I was 22 years old that's why I was a late bloomer in the gay world was it like when you were in high school and when do you know you know I don't know that I have like I don't remember like I never had like an aha moment per say for me it was going through high school like I was involved in a bunch of stuff you know you're actually also played football was doing the weight lifting thing like the class president so had my hands in a bunch of different pots College super and do everything as well really just focused on school and actually dated a girl for like a year-and-a-half and college in college yet but did you like a boy it was more like a friendship in a relationship again but you know like we were cool and everything and everything is going well but like nothing else was really going on when you came out with she like so did you like that's what I like really I thought it very differently than straight p*** because like straight p*** here's the rub in the straight Community you look at 3.2 like especially someone like me was daughter so you probably did something awful to those girls when they were young like that's like 9 out of 10 times yeah and that's why they turned to p*** but when you see gay points like a couple of dudes like to f*** even in like I'm at Dan Savage 11. You know we're talking about gay p*** it's like it's like they don't think of it the same way now or not at all yeah so I ended up breaking up with that girl and I told her I was like that like I think I'm gay and I need to like figure this s*** out you know I'm 22 like when I least enjoy my 20s you know trying to figure out if I if I like dudes or not she like damn she was not very nice about it yeah yeah it didn't it went downhill pretty quickly I really like we're living together at the time I can remember in college like my kind of living together and then like I got kicked out and my car for a little while so it was kind of a shitshow oh yeah them like you know like 6 months later she's like blowing up my phone saying gave her chlamydia I was like that's does not on me not on me that's it it's been longer than that to since we were doing anything so that's hilarious yeah yeah I mean I don't think it's because like all those like halls and everything we're coming through when I was with my now-husband Joey so like we were dating at that time and now my ex-girlfriend is going to my phone saying I gave her the clap but was he Laughing At first she was like what the f*** is going on cuz like we literally been dating for 2 months so you you become you decide okay I got a deal with reality I'm Gap you meet that one guy and then you're still with them still married with him we just got married this past March I'll send a year that's kind of crazy yeah you didn't even play the field about this all the time cuz we met in like the typical Millennial Gateway on Grindr and you know I was I wasn't even out actually before we met so like on Ender I was like that shirtless torso pic cuz I was still you know and she lives so we got really lucky with the first guy that came my way for her right yeah like I imagine being a girl in the where the guy is wrong with our relationship like there's no more other like it's me it's you and run it it's not you it's me is it that is like a way that some people try to fix it and particularly like uber religious folks yeah I mean I mean obviously like with an Instagram handle world's strongest gay I get more s*** on a daily basis on social media that I can't even count most of it's from like religious people really oh yeah jerking off while they're doing probably thinking about you do you need to stop being so gay and delicious my go-to responses you know hey man I don't read fiction so doing that but I just always think it's funny because you know they're like you know like obviously I'm very open with my sexuality on social media which is awesome and the comments on the world strongest man they're like you're pushing the gay agenda like all this b******* and I'm like listen now I'm like the only agenda we're pushing its like I just want to be treated like everybody else when I get the same s*** that you do you know I've never once like tried to make someone gay you know like meanwhile Christians are in my DM saying like you need to convert I'm not K you need to suck a dick like what it is about whoever is listening if you could like hit me up and let me know I'd love to learn about it yeah you need to get an entire net Club I guess I do the gay agenda got the rainbow Mohawk doesn't make me that gay it's not like you marriage is it people that are really dumb or they're secretly worried that they're so delicious and I share that all the time on my social media just so you know I think it's a good looking amazing that's what it is like worried about the gay agenda when I was 7 years old and moved to San Francisco neighbor was his gay couple my aunt used to go next door and they would get to get naked smoke pot and play Bongos together sick I didn't even hear the term faget until I was eleven and we move to Florida I remember hearing that when I was a little like wow like I had a my friend his name was candy candido is a Cuban kid and his dad was real mad cuz gay people getting married is reading this newspaper can't f****** believe this s*** down seeing freakout does like I would have weird thing to waste your time thinking about for sure I mean not send you were super lucky to have that kind of upbringing see that ugly part of you know the world cuz I mean the thing is with me know I'm fortunate enough for like not many people like talk s*** to me in person you know like I'm an average sized strong man like I'm not really that big of a dude what's the average size trauma you like 300 lb funny I just completed this weekend against Brian Shaw on the motherfukers 428 I'm 5-10 like a man cool like most people don't talk to me person it's like on social media but it did happen one time and Texas of all places I just finished a truck pulling in call me a fat guy from The Stand like all this stuff and like I was like dude I suck dick and I'm stronger than you you know I think like in that situation like I feel like people feel like they're Invincible like they feel like they have the power cuz they're in the crowd somebody like who's competing to like say something this year so it's really cool to see the support throughout the entire Community how do you get dubbed The Unofficial fan pay really who I got was getting like a loud Applause whenever my not name. Now I really don't give a fuk Aldi when I came out I didn't care what people thought I didn't care who thought you know if they didn't like me that in like now just cut him out you know for sure I didn't have to do that transpired was it because the weight of it was so it was gave me so much relief that you felt like who gives a s*** now now I'm free was it like that was there was a lot that went into it so I like in my mind I didn't like want to come out until I know it seems like I knew I was really gay no dating my now-husband for 6 weeks that was kind of the Tipping Point and at that point in our relationship we try to realize my car at this wasn't just going to be like a playing in just having fun like we are actually you know taking the steps to kind of be committed and see what was going to happen here not expected marriage but so I came out mainly because of him because he had he been out since he was 17 and at this point we were 22 and I didn't feel like it was fair for him to be in a relationship with somebody that the closet and I was like the biggest motivator for it and once you so so you re happy seeing this happy relationship so if people are upset at you you like I don't give a fuk I have what I want and I'm had better place yet and you also I mean I must defeat them in putting words in your mouth but I must feel like when you do become out or you do come out it must feel like a knot just a relief but like you use solidified you're fine you're free your you yeah yeah I mean it's it's exhausting like waking up every day pretending to be somebody you're not you know like you would have to act different than you want to do you have to talk to about girls to guys like when you were going to I was always just like Riley a year like when you were young with your like hey something might be different you know I think like I think back to like middle school and you know I think it's just like the Saratoga like I was in the theater I was in the music I played sports but wasn't really that good at them and actually was a cheerleader do you like I was trying my first cheerleading team in 7th grade and you know the funny thing is is he know there was tryouts and everything and I got the fourth highest score out of all the girls so I figured that was you know a little Telltale sign like I was I didn't turn my first cheerleading team in 7th grade and you know the funny thing is as you know there was tryouts and everything and I got the fourth highest score out of all the girls so I figured that was you know a little telltale signs</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> female cheerleaders whatsoever I have a buddy who's a male cheerleader who's awesome piece Chappelle's 99.9% sure you straight spell lazy but he's built like a brick shithouse to weird. Chapelle does the stuff we grabbed him by the feet and flips them in the area catches them on one hand but it's bananas physical power you have to have to be able to do that I'm in coordination now that's crazy balls can you go back then no no no that's that's actually one of the reasons why I like so I when I was in high school like actually look to do in college at the Collegiate level but tumbling was like a minimum requirement now so I can a little too chunky and I'm not going to do that s*** so cool and a substitute happened to walk by who owns a CrossFit gym and he was like Hey you know I am at this cross with you in like you seem like it like this stuff in a pretty strong like feel free to come by so I would start I started training with him like 5 in the morning before school and I found really quickly I stuck to CrossFit but I'd like to lifting heavy s*** in this was back in 2009 and walked into the gym one morning and they're like hey there's a a local strongman contest the Saturday was signed you up for it so when you say you suck CrossFit just a bunch of Olympic lifts and different explosive exercises just wasn't in shape to do magic well in the workouts yeah I got my ass kicked so glass place we were 17 and how much lifting had you done previous to that maybe before 5 months really but the point like I had hit the 500-pound deadlift and you don't have been Lifting for a couple months yeah I'll see just a freak genetically that's a lot of weight for a few months of lifting yasso the contest went horrible for me but I absolutely fell in love with the sport Springfield College in Massachusetts and join their powerlifting team and that's when I kind of got you no more of a background in lifting proper technique and all that stuff and then did another local strongman contest where I met this guy Matt Mills who owns a gym lightning Fitness in Connecticut where I train now and he was like yeah you know like I'm just starting to get all the strongman equipment you should come down it's only about 30 minutes from your school so I would I actually would go there every Saturday morning from when I was in college to train strongman and that's when I kind of started competing in the amateur circuit you know and that's kind of led me on my trajectory to hear rare people that actually lives in Connecticut I live in Massachusetts right over the Border work out real quick and at least and all that other crazy s*** you know the cool thing about strong man is every contest is different that we do we know we never do the same in all done the support for over 10 years now and I've never done a contest for the events of been the same in that span of time do you know what it's going to be before you sign up typically will you know what about series of left 8-12 weeks notice depending on the contest so the gym that I was going to in Connecticut they were just starting to acquire strongman equipment so pretty bare-bones so like we had a log you know for the log clean and press they had some Atlas Stones Some Farmers handles a yolk and that's pretty much it and then over the years he would get more and more and more and now it's turned into this massive 15,000 square foot facility in the gym on a recall and Equipment horror because he buys something every time something new comes out he buys it so yeah like my my exposure to the equipment in the beginning was pretty minimal but what I did to compensate for that as I just repeated more so I would pretty much from Springfield The Chew since I drove 5 Hour radius from where I was and any contest there was in that radius I would do so in my first like three years I competed probably like almost 40 times how often do these things being held at the amateur level pretty often there's usually you confide we know I would say one or two per month in New England alone all of the country so you know I think the cool thing is you don't like I took last of my first contest in that went on for a while I took Dad last night by first aid shows that I did so I got wasn't good at this thing when I started know when did you start being successful 20 so I went to amateur Nationals actually in the 200 lb weight class by weight in under 200 lb in 2011 was my first time at the international so I've been doing it for about 2 years surprised myself and end up taking second place in that Weekly I went back to the international does a 231 and 212 and took second place there and then won the amateur National Championship in 2013 and that's where I be turkey and where I won my pro-karting kind of got to that next level but it's such a difficult thing to do that I would imagine doing it 40 times a year like you're going to get injured luckily I didn't really get anything you know I'm fortunate we're so by trade and what I went to school for his I'm an athletic trainer so Sports I'm kind of been my thing so you know I've been lucky enough to learn when I was training of when I need to back off when I can push a little bit harder what needs to be taken care of and just try to be smart you know I'm going to be no knock on wood you know I've had one Serious injury in the 10 years that I've been doing this what was that put me out of commission for a little while and be not to drop it at a contest I was in second place by one point it was the final event of the contest and that I went to push the stone onto the the thing is with me being only 5 10 with the atlas Stones like the first box you have to put the stone on his high so this was 75 in tall secured ended up rolling off fell on my chest yeah buck and you know naturally that was the first contest my mom have come seen in person in like 4 years until March of 2019 took me out for a while at 275 lb f****** Stone ball and I was the last one we had in the series wow Jesus Christ so just your background and understanding athletic science or exercise science allows you to know when you're being silly and when you know you're not going to be a p**** but you're not going to be dumb exactly and I think that's where it's that's why lucky you know I kind of stayed injury-free because he didn't like to this day like you know somebody coaches you know pretty well renowned strongman Derek Poundstone who took second place in world strongest man and he program some crazy s*** for me but there are some days are just like you do this is not going to fly today when you have a light like what's a light day and 4 days a week and I get like one like I call him like my Brodie it's I bench back in arms day you know yeah yeah so it it's more just like cuz I bench pressing like villager triceps going to build up the anterior delts going to help like you actually helps your overhead lifts and so I do that and that's what I consider like my life is so so 4 days a week and so how do you how do you structure it to do every other day to do it all depends on it really is so typically I try to go Tuesday Thursday Friday Sunday that's usually my my average week so Tuesday is like my big overhead day where I'll do a strong man movement overheads like log press or dumbbell and then a bunch of shoulder overhead accessory work Thursday my day to is my biggest day so I squat and deadlift in the same day and that's a workout that sometimes takes 4 to 5 hours yeah places in between each workout so you lift and then do do you have like a large malathion and pepper recipes that sometimes like you know like we're building up the Arnold strongman Classic in Columbus Ohio this coming March and you know we have a Max that was coming up and you know I'm potentially going to be home for a 1000 pound deadlift and deadlift workout wear that was about 850 lb on the on the the deadlift right there what is that the dumbbell right there was 250 250 one arm overhead press yeah fukin a the deadlift always so what is that f****** things called what is the new building for abdominal pressure but also gives just like some tactile feedback to like nowhere you need to brace so usually weightlifters like we'll put it where like we feel we kissed in our core that's going to help us activate those muscles to be a little bit stronger and you know more effectively brace to prevent injury cuz I never protect you from a lift lifting heavy weights that strap on your back yeah it's not really tightness I guess it's not really meant like protect for say more just like help add extra support that's the biggest thing so it does you don't do heavy lift without no no now I keep it on yeah whenever I'm going heavy this pretty much standard for powerlifters powerlifting strongman just like help add extra support that's the biggest thing so it does you don't do heavy lift without no no now I keep it on ya whenever I'm going heavy this pretty much standard for powerlifters powerlifting strongman you like pretty heavy duty belts</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you must be getting me this like the first time probably the LBGTQ Community has gotten behind a strong man though I mean this is just a pro athlete General really you know I think well that's like it that's the biggest reason for my Instagram name is just like showing lgbtq like visibility in Pro Sports cuz it doesn't exist and that's cool but men different animal know I think like there's this really big disconnect we're like people think like okay lesbian women are allowed to be strong they're allowed to be athletic but I can do all these really cool things gay men have to be feminine they have to put in this box and they shouldn't be pro athletes and that's one of the biggest reasons why I'm so you know I call myself like unapologetically open about my sexuality because like it really is you know the more you think about it like if you even try to think of like an open the game man in any Pro Sport across the world really mainstream I think you forgot about Brian Boitano gay don't remember South Park what would Brian Boitano do strongman is by no means like major mainstream yet but we're getting there people know about it for sure and I think to see like an openly gay man you know I say competing in arguably one of the most liked hyper-masculine sports in the world Sports UFC and lifting s*** like right like one you're beating another dude up the other one it's a bunch of guys standing around a weight be like how I'm going to pick it up and I'll pick it up I'll pick up after you know like it's like neanderthal yeah that's top of the food chain man leash it exactly so I think it's like super important to see like an openly gay man in a relationship Rock and rainbow Mohawk and rainbow tights out of the competition for I think that makes people feel more comfortable than if you just out there sling a dick in a relationship I'm not afraid of you but what does scare me is if you wanted to rape me you hell it I'm doing in the sport and just try to be more visible for the lgbtq community in Pro Sports in general I hate messages on a daily basis since all the time why do you love it a lot of people don't like to me I use it as fuel line there's no bigger f*** you to that person than me winning you know like that's alright that's how I look at it I'm one of the top 10 strongest man in the world competing at this Arnold strongman classic in March so that's why I love it I love reading that but light is a funny thing but totally sidetracked sucking dick and you would think that you would have a lot of sponsors that would jump in because of this though I would think because you're open and because this is such a manly sport and it's such a non-stereotypical thing would be like really positive for the LBGTQ community you know it's all you know and that's my biggest thing like while doing this whole thing is like just trying to spread positivity and love throughout the entire world you know I mean I talked about the hate messages that I got but like the ones that mean a lot or like you do I got a message a few months ago from a sixteen-year-old kid who was on the verge of committing suicide because he couldn't come to terms with the sexuality and he has post like finding my profile let him be comfortable with himself you know awesome crazy that's so cool it's like if I never expected to be that person just by saying I love this dude but you know sometimes how you get to be that person right yeah that's that's why this whole thing has kind of blown up into what it is and why I'm you know Fortune enough to now be working on a documentary it what's the documentary was approached by Andy who she was on the set of world strongest man and she was like once she saw my husband I kiss after one of the events like light bulbs just went off and she was like there's something here so I was approached about doing a documentary about my life Annabelle being the only openly gay pro strong man in the world how do I bet you're coming to my title in the closet WNBA where everyone's gay basketball to that's how I like at least strong my mood boards awesome but like I always think alike via the Family Guy episode where they're talking about the WNBA and they're like oh and listen to the fan that has one guy cheering in the Phantom and stands but it's a tough sell Julie strong maimuna Sports is awesome but like I always think alike via the Family Guy episode where they're talking about the WNBA and they're like oh and listen to The Fan guy cheering in the fan understands but yeah it's a tough sell</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> medical testing we have to go through before contest is crazy the Pat the medical packet that we have to get filled out by our primary Care's for world strongest man is like 48 pages long but yeah it's wild dude so that the email that it's like here's the medical pack you need done by this date and you pretty much to make an appoint with your primary care and get it all done so what is your doctor say when you come to him with that f****** 48-page packet well luckily I've gone to work a few times with it so she knows to block off sometimes she knows what it's because like we had to get an EKG testing we have to get a full blood panel done they have to look at everything because they don't want somebody dropping dead on TV ad already over train to write like your creatinine levels and they look at everything I mean it's a full blood panel they like I said they do the EKG they look at the heart they do and then it's a full medical history as well just get everything from parents to pass diseases to what runs in the family everything and are you guys aren't insured by these competitions are you know it's all on you a real piano risky I mean that seems kind of crazy that during the competition itself you're not you're not covered on us even those medical pack is like they say like all all all fees associated with this are up to the athlete expense and they don't pay that well can you put look at it so like wolf remains been around since the 70s the game right so the Arnold strongman classic in Ohio is like kind of seen as the most elite competition in the world because only 10 guys qualify for that contest will shocks me to get 25 and then the prize money in Ohio is better than world Strongest Man somewhat double so each of the Arnold International shows its standard prize money so young intl shows there was one here in Santa Monica this weekend there's Australia South America South okay Europe Canada I think that's it but we all know the prize money going into each show because it's the same everyone so it's like 10 grand for First 8642 Once they pay out top-6 but they also pay all our travel there so it's not too bad no but then the big motivation is to get a while right where first place is 85 Grand and a paddle 10 athletes but like third-place at second second or third place at Ohio makes just as much as world strongest man so this is probably why you have to compete for two times a year I'm a kind of imperative I think it's like 3 hours like I didn't really do that well this past weekend so I didn't make any money this weekend like a contest like he was more like a tag aging I was trying to gauge where I was at going into Columbus the events were really similar to do you do that look you have to be care old to not go to Crazy in one of these events cuz I lost something I definitely like held back this weekend you know I think I could have hit another gear if I needed to but already having my qualification of the Big Show I'm like mentally I had I don't think I'd be able to like turn it on like I need to in Ohio what date was week of March so your schedule like to prepare for something like that so the biggest thing so we look at the attached right so you know I mentioned we have the max deadlift so my goals that are 3000 lb which would be which would make me the first person under 300 lb of bodyweight to do that in history yeah how close are you I told 970 in July if you don't get to 300 lb don't gain too much weight you can nail I don't want to like I I was I was almost 300 like 298 at world strongest man in 2018 I was a fat f*** it was gross like I look at my house and I like 100 you wanted like the lady next to me like I had neck rolls on my neck rolls I like I was gross oh man I look at my pictures in my head look like a f****** blueberry and getting better at the sport so I don't see a reason to get any bigger but right now it seems do a deadlift for a regular person extra 30 lbs a lot but not when you're already doing 970 f****** pounds in like to go back to like the prep and like the ramp up this contest you know like before like this weekend we had the deadlift was a 775 for wraps in a minute and I pulled six which is okay. Like I probably could have pulled seven or eight if I needed to the winning number was nine and everybody that ironically everybody that finished ahead of me that event has already dead lifted over thousand pounds but like leading up into these next few weeks like I'm going to start working like my heaviest metal said it before this contest was 85041 I'm going to start working up into that modem did Nines in the next couple of weeks and probably have my lap heavy heavy deadlift probably 3 weeks before I contest 2 and 1/2 weeks before the contest and then do you deadlift at all before up leading up to the contest if I do it'll be light very relative body recover like people forget like when we're training this hard like we're beat the s*** and like where we get stronger when we when we rest and recover so I really don't exercise or lip like the week of a contest like I'll do my recovery workouts I talked about before we like I'm just kind of swimming hot tub sauna that stuff but I won't lift any weights and after like my body like my central nervous system like everything just needs a break and you get straw over that. Offer sure are overtraining and in other ways cuz now you really a deload right so it's like where you ramping up wrapping of going super having any back off for a little bit right in his last week Aldi load and there's some coaches that guy every 4th week of their program regardless and I don't agree with that cuz I don't think anybody can work that hard for 3 weeks to get to beat down their body enough for they need it every single fourth week normal people don't train hard enough to need regular D loads the DLow the guys who practice that way are they winning or they know in all honestly I don't feel people like I feel like you have to earn your deload and that's like what my coach does with me like I'm an old 6 months without a deload leading into this content that happened about a month-and-a-half ago and I knew I needed it because I was tired everyday regardless of how much sleep I got I didn't want to go to the gym every time I get to the gym I was f****** miserable I just wanted to leave I didn't want to look at anything I don't want to talk to anybody and I text Mike I need a f****** break and he was like all right cool I was waiting for to get to that point but if it's like it's like I feel like it's something you have to earn such as people like people think they work hard but they don't really know what that means until they're like actually pushed to do something and that's where it where I got that point and that's why I like these next five weeks are going to be like super crucial in my training to this contest cuz I'm going to I'm going to beat my body to s*** 5 weeks you know when my husband will probably get pissed off because I'll be a prick one or two times at least but it's like you know this the biggest competition of the world and I know what I need to sacrifice to get to that point and that's going to mean Long training sessions really hard training sessions and you know just like Sims going to be my body down just to reap those rewards at the end of it biggest competition of the world and I know what I need to sacrifice to get to that point and that's going to mean Long training sessions really hard training sessions and you know just like I said it was going to be my body down just to reap those rewards at the end of it it hurts and cranky and just</div>

enough these people want to try something other than mushrooms like what are you looking for are you an ass is not strong enough for you that you can turn off that you can switch off Michelle Doxie it's 5-meo test where they just alter a chemical rice slightly it doesn't fit that's where 5 Meo DMT was not classified as one of the band psychedelics in the 1970s weeping psychedelic act n n dimethyltryptamine was it was labeled 5-meo is DMT with an oxygen molecule attached to it which eliminate some I don't know what exactly that works but the visuals are very different it looks very different feels very different it's way more potent and it was legal forever like you could order it in the year two thousands we would get it from a f****** Chemical Company where you ordered over the internet and they would send you like a aspirin bottle of the s*** you can literally put the entire city on the moon with that Astor at that little aspirin while I got two days and it was so potent and is his white your powder that is like straight from his lab, Seneca grade pharmaceutical grade you in the center of the f****** Universe you feel like you're part of every cell in every Adam and every new try everything but your your part of everything you were the soup of it all there's no Detachment between you and things yeah yeah everything's just said you're absolutely one hundred percent sure you're dead and it probably is what happens when you die and then he come out of it you like what in the f*** like I just got that from a company is order that with Visa card that goes crazy this is a new you'd be able to just buy the stuff I do isn't host of these different things like do you remember Salvia I was just talked about today that's the legal or not I don't know because it's kind of falling out of favor it's not something people talked about a lot but when people found out that you could just get Salvia from a head shop head shop supposed to be but then they start selling the most mind-blowing psychedelic known to man 10 minutes yes unbelievably powerful a podcast and you lived in alternative life for three months he had a family he had jobs yet friends and then all the sudden came back to reality and he's like what yeah there he is right there until he was different world the fake one am I wrong apparently when you would have the Catholic priest going down the aisle waving that would either be Sage which is I think like a derivative of salvia divinorum I think not a derivative of cousin may be a close relative I think sage and Salvia divinorum or extremely close Okay in terms of like the Genesis genus Genesis I think it's real close I think it's it's one of those things where they think that maybe people were burning that but they were probably also most definitely burning cannabis and so they will wafting through the aisles with cannabis smoke getting everybody Second Hand high the Epic structure gigantic beautiful artworks they're calling buildings stage of salvia okay all stages are over time do the terms has been closely aligned with cooking or medicinal use and the term salvias been give it to more ornamental members of the jenis-jenis never the last Salvia is the Latin name or genus given to all these plants stage wow or closing a basic process purposes yeah then it all lyric Ross yeah yeah early Frost yeah they apparently he's a really good one like they've they really think that that really could have been at well they also there's a book called the article about the Oracle at Delphi right and she had these visions and she would prophesy the future and they went there and they found that they found her stool she was sitting over or her stool if she said that this country likes doing big date you can get those dinosaur poop fossilized so they found she was sitting over a crack with natural gas coming out so she's getting high off of whatever that is so it was natural gas leaking out to the ground where she was partying yeah of course she's going to speak in gibberish and and having all these Visions like when you inhale totally makes sense yeah I think that's probably a lot of these cases of course wacky things that people did I mean it only makes sense I mean they never did figure out what Soma is in the ancient Hindu is that right yeah but they don't know what is all this different speculation like some people think was a combinatory that it was like psilocybin mixed with something else and lotus flowers always different different series but nobody really knows but someone was obviously something that they were taken as a Sacrament they would have these profound effects that's most likely the root of all of these crazy religious experiences as people are tripping they're f****** balls off and they weren't lying like God did come to them which is Rich and DMT that's probably why this is the the metaphor right though the burning bush and God spoke to them in the burning bush that's probably it really means they were tripping but he was smoking it tripping balls and they met God and it came back with this is the only way we're going to get along and go to stop raping each other mystery religions that you have to be initiated into them and if you're going to join this whatever for lack of better term and they give you here take this you are going to experience something not only that no one ever that you've ever heard of right but like you don't even know how to handle it will change your life away but there's no vocabulary for it there it's not like now you know that's it it's your likes holyshit this is religious right you see you would think it's god dammit God John Marco Allegro racial group that they put together that was agnostic did he start studying while he was he was a ordained minister Benny start studying theology as I wanted to look at the etymology of the words he is his conclusion after 14 years that the entire Christian religion was a gigantic misunderstanding and what it really was about was psychedelic mushroom experiences and fertility rituals okay broke down the word Jesus to an ancient word that an ancient Sumerian word that means a mushroom covered in God's semen and the idea was that the the rain which would make everything grow well God come and there wasn't a bad thing I didn't think of, as bad they wanted to live everybody wanted it wanted to have children they wanted to prosper you and that when the rain would come mushrooms would appear almost instantaneously I've ever seen and when they would eat those they would trip they're f****** balls up so they had decided that this was Jesus and that this this this was what is godson yeah God created us from his own seed this is what Marco allegro's his research was going to he was trying to say that what was really going on with these people are trying to hide a lot of what the Psychedelic rituals are from the Romans and from the people that capture them they hit them in stories and Parables and there was all sorts of problems in the tree patients taking things from ancient Hebrew and you're breaking it down to the Latin and you break it down to German and English and I can't I can't believe he got a positive reception for this if you're taken. Didn't necessarily the book got bought out okay by the Catholic church and then recently reinstated and then got out they bought it they liked it. I think they took it off the market I think used to be able to only get a copy of is the only be able to get a like a used copy okay and then Ian Irvin put it out he republished it like a few maybe eight ten years ago so now you get ahold of you also publish another book after they took that one back what I think I don't know that the total history of it but probably the second book the second book was the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Christian myth in the first one was the sacred mushroom and the cross only makes sense if you think about people who live back then and we know that psychedelic mushrooms aren't recent like forever people found them and they most certainly did as there's a lot of depictions of them and is also a lot of iconography and a lot of like you see shapes that resemble mushrooms like all over the place and some of the ancient artwork and even people that are dancing naked under the influence of a mushroom soup as a translucent mushroom shape that surrounds them and ancient paintings and these religious paintings these people are dancing samosa they were tripping balls well if you didn't know any better of course you would think that's God talking to you if you know what psilocybin is you didn't know what dimethyltryptamine is you know what any of these things are going to hear voices because if you look at all these religious but more like guides to live life in a more virtuous or Pius or more away and then after it's over you want to be a better person but there's also a sense of comfort that it's going to be okay traditionally gives a lot of people like a sense of reassurance that someone's looking out you're not going to accidentally you know going in that it's a feeling that even if it's not okay it's okay garbage Dallas was one of them sweet with I think it's literally the best show of all time I was his name Jr was there you trip balls and talked about on CNN and said that it was one of the best experiences of his life cuz he no longer was afraid of death that before that he was afraid of death and the one thing that trippin I'm trippin hard apparently really did for him that he no longer held that fear and he had stared death in the face with his alcoholism liver transplant Prince of his life cuz he no longer was afraid of death that before that he was afraid of death and the one thing that trippin I'm trippin hard apparently really did forms that he no longer held that fear and he had stared death in the face cuz his alcoholism liver transplant whoever was so it was no joke is a huge alcoholic</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> Rachel Hawk wasps sent me so this is one of the there's a guy who made a scale right he got stung by all the different insects and this is fighting five there's also a 5 plus they're very hard to get you the sting them is a guy who online goes through and get Sinnoh Stone but the reason they're so dangerous or or so venomous what they do is they sting the tarantula lay their eggs inside the tarantula and then tarantulas eaten alive by The Offspring 4 weeks and then when this was discovered this kind of stuff in the Middle Ages they were like this in a big theological dilemma because got wife at God make this happen yet why would God do that nature is I mean I could go down to the rabbit hole 4 hours please do so one of the one of the cousins that flowers called something in fantasy te so that didn't say anything about that flower represents the largest flower in the world two weeks yeah but the plant parasite right so the plant that it comes from has no stems roots or leaves so you can't keep it on display cuz it is entirely inside another species of Vine yeah we get ready people are there gorgeous they are beautiful oh wow look at that one where the guy's got his hand on it before so that's what it looks like sitting on the ground and then it pops open. Some f****** Avatar s*** right there I have something from the island of socotra which is an archipelago near the coast of Yemen called Duvall the Andhra duvalin dra and their flowers look I like meat because you won't attract flies and the hotter it gets in the house the more the flower smells it's really cool when you get into someone's actually heat activated just like rotten food would be it looks like a blown out butthole yeah but from an alien all there is there is a butthole that smells like s*** if you look up white slonia white Sloane a it smells like an a****** and has hairs that wriggle in the wind and it's it to replicate an a****** to White Sloane a like named after white and Sloan is from Somalia oh God how weird just the sheer variety and that smells like a butthole and has hair on it yet the hair mousse my friend calls and God mistakes you put it with the sheer variety of nature so weird isn't it great that mean we're just hoping that's not unusual is an assholes Not Unusual and every animal has an a****** why is it unusual to have a plant that looks like an a****** and we have the expression you're eating attract more flies with honey than like a pic to Shutterfly to ship you're going to flowers that smell like s*** yes and there's a lot of them there's a whole family of them and they're gorgeous yeah they smell when they pop open a fart noise like a fart cuz it's contained and then it pops open oh so like the gas is come out of it when it pops up Yahoo releases a dose you look up the biggest One Stop Aaliyah stapelia Are there any plants that have the same effect on people that like you know that one will not return evil plan actually the fungus so there's one branch of the cordyceps mushroom that infects ants get to know ya so that they spray the spores everywhere they die it grows inside of them then literally explodes out into the air so the spores one fact other ants Rowland ants find out that one of their members has been infected they'll take that Aunt way out of the community like wait to take a walk yeah cuz they know somehow or another that this thing's going to blow up on all their family he took they had found footage of this and literally like the mushroom grows out of the ant's head and the cops out if there's a lot of things that they're learning now about nature controlling the minds of other beings we haven't really a recent kind Discovery and have you locked news parasitic relationship one of my favorite ones ever was the the grasshopper that gets infected by this aquatic worm The Aquatic worm gets it to commit suicide so they can give birth to this warm it literally gets into the wiring of the Grasshoppers brain and convinces it to jump into a puddle what about the louse that eats fishes tongue becomes a functional tongue and become the time so there's there's a lot of this kind of crazy stuff yeah there's because it's so much easier to be a parasite you'd latch on your getting attrition you don't got to do anything you have to hunt you have to graze and you're just said well that's also just obviously parasitic if you want to think about it most organisms are semi parasite in that we need other organisms in order to survive if you're a farmer wants to hear a parasite if you're a beef farmer yeah and the other thing is if every species has several parasite they how many we had lice and it makes sense the majority of a parasitic micro-level you get down to her gut the different bacteria on your skin it's really fascinating how clever many of these organisms are it's a trip it's a weird thing to be a person my friend but it's also weird how we're finding out things that are even crazier and crazier the great now they're doing a lot of deep sea exploration and the things at the bottom of the ocean are just like what is that you saw that deepstaria thing. The jellyfish that looks like a lava lamp yes just like well that's also Dragonfish use a red light source because red doesn't show off show up for others so they can see what they've been known as can it's like my picture this is just amazing it's so cool and this hope realest amazing is how they're freaking out the scientist or watching it there like pacu got pretty that is now this thing has never seen light for millions of years it's the bottom of the sea so the fact that it knows how to react is Aurora's having a reaction is is pretty cool just the fact that that's a real thing that exists if we found out on the planet somewhere weird freak out this is the overlord this is the overmind of the planet and it's in the gelatinous form and it communicates you with vibrations this is why my autistic wouldn't let me watch Star Trek as a kid because I knew about stuff and then I'm watching Star Trek and they're going another planet is like a guy with a blue face and I'm just like this stupid it's just the guy wears look at Earth look at this right we can octopus it yeah they pulled it ashore and remove the octopus from the noble Eagle but a seagull sorry b**** that's a wrap but they're nasty their thieves they are so used to company that has a raise organic chickens that lost 2.2 million dollars and chickens to Eagles 160000 Eagles expats they go over there partying to have sex with underage eagles they were drafted for sure there's no rules up there that Wildland to the north believe that they decided to save the f****** thing and that weird oh my God octopus life cycle sometimes that they want have sex the male octopus and they just jakim and eat them what about the cut where they pretend to be female so they played yeah they're like beta males that are male feminists yeah they pretend to be something that London a female and pretend to be female and they f*** the females have male female mannerisms and characteristics just like these beta males and they sneak up next to him as an ally it's like they get their rocks off it's like every Washington Post reporter and they sneak up next to him as an ally it's like they get their rocks off it's like every Washington Post reporter and it's not in my last form autism is a good move</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I'm an entirely convinced that we're going to be in inside of a hundred years live in a world where all of your thoughts really are documented and there's theirs they have access to them the same way no one in their Wildest Dreams conceived the photographs 400 years ago and 400 years from now we're going to have the ability to record record thoughts and ideas and they're going to be able to read the contents of each other's minds right they could be maybe we do maybe we need some regulation maybe or maybe we just have to accept the fact that most of what goes wrong in the world goes wrong because people can think these secrets sneaky fried up. And when we do those no longer exist anymore maybe we'll clean out human behavior limits episode about that in the 1950s listen to all these conversations Indian on all this fun fun stuff but then this is one guy who's really dark like he's going to he's going to come in and blow everybody away and climaxes where he comes in and tells everybody in it and they go in there and it turns out they were going to do that next door it's called and so he did the research on asking subjects have you ever thought about killing somebody you didn't like and turn it like 80% of guys and 67% of women have had homicidal fantasies in their life 99.9% of never act on tell me what you would do and oh my God they're just incredible to read like I would break every bone in his body and then I would pull out fingernails and then I would just go out of your life but it's just fantasy some people of suicidal fantasies this guy's thinking about robbing the bank so he had a fantasy about it going to do it I thought about doing that iPhone Sterrett pictures other people's butts right Instagram and no longer board you know when I was in my religious phase and in college I asked I thought I have no idea and need that play again the deaf shall hear again and your body will be whole again and so she says well that's he I had uterine cancer so I had my uterus taken out do I get my uterus back when I go to heaven they said yeah because I don't want it back and you liked it the earlier Christian cult sex before they card introduced dualism they believe that you are when you're resurrected at the Inn after your death you are physically there in heaven physically and your soul the whole thing that's just one thing so the question is what how old are you when you're there you know so you're brought up there you're sitting next to Jesus and God and then whatever 3030 seems like a good year three now so what happens all the memories of my life for the last 33 years how do you get all those memories okay but the memory of my being 30 now is different from the memory I had when I was 50 of being 30 and 40 being 30 and even when I was in my thirties being 30 in a bit the memories are always changing and edited in in in in in forgotten or modified Glee based on life experiences that happened afterwards so in your twenties you go to discology marry this person to take this job whatever you don't really know what the info in the impact of those decisions are until much later in life which is why I always think it's ridiculous for people to write Memoirs in their twenties or thirties cuz they're celebrities that you have no idea what those things actually mean until much later so this is the problem of who you are so first of all we already know that none of your body is the same material it was a decade ago your cells are all recycled the molecules and atoms are gone there's new ones that replace it the pattern is the information that represents you Joe Rogan this is what you look like these are your memories still somehow that this has to be copied so and Ray Kurzweil scenario of the singularity we're going to upload the mind they're going to copy your connectome all your memories in your synapses okay so right away there's the problem of will which memories will all of them there are no fixed set of memories that are you your memories are always changing so the mummy take a snapshot of it that's just a fixed Point that's not you really you are this Nina long Continuum that's always kind of flexible unchanging so there's that and then there's the problem the up mind uploading scenario is there's two kinds of cells is the memory cells meme south of all your memories and then there's the point of view South POV self so when you go to sleep tonight you wake up tomorrow you're still looking at the world through your eyes and there's a continuity of point of view from one day to the next same thing with general anesthesia so like in the Johnny Depp movie Transcendence where he's poised these terrorists and he's dying he's got to like a week ago he copies has mind connected clothing of the genome and puts it into a computer and then he dies and they turn the computer on and he's in the computer looking out to the little camera hole I don't see how this could happen that is if we copied you your connectome everything all your memories so we had a Joe Rogan number to copy ready to go but instead of you dying let's say we had a sophisticated fmri brain scan machine slid you into it copied connect them uploaded it into the cloud or what and you're in then we slide you back at your standing there you you're still looking at the world through your eyes that's just Joe Rogan number to copy and no more do you look at that than a twin looks at it siblings as well there I am no no you're still standing. I'm here that's just a copy of me and so this to me seems essential problem with the Mind uploading scenario it's just a copy did you see the thing National Geographic today about the cloned monkeys no yeah Jimmy I tweeted it earlier today it's crazy and what are speculating that if they can do that to monkeys they're going to be able to be able to do that to him who is that that is very weird like ice data girls twin sister look exactly like her but like a little off just as something I feel like I truvista super super confused so they weren't the same person but they pretty much worry yeah here's the here's the article school at their clone monkey created in the lab now what yeah okay the article school at their clone monkeys created in the lab now what yeah okay well so you're making copies but it's not the same person individual life experiences at the moment you and your copy start diverging away and leading different lives in a different memories</div>

	<div> <a class="links" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi_J4y2SDGA"> Joe Rogan on Near Death Experiences </a>
		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> things like that sell out in your book did you go over near death experiences who do you think is going on like when people like the ones that are fascinated me or people in the hospital bed that's either body right and you're dealing with a bunch of chemicals are released in the body right there's morphine and all sorts of dig out things yet basically on the edge right so important member that they're their near-death experiences you're not actually dead so there's there's a liminal transitional stage there where you're sliding into some other state of consciousness and altered state of consciousness and we know that if you inject or you take those are molecules that operate on a lock and key mechanism with the synapses in your brain and your neurons so if they these external drugs were in this molecular key mechanism there must be natural chemicals similar molecular weight to that in the brain already just in smaller doses so one theory about near-death experiences is that is this this is a way of transitioning from living to dead without feeling anxious and falling apart and upset and depressed or whatever it's kind of a smooth feel good in a better than a morphine drip kind of way of making the transition and that but we know for example that this scientist named doctor whinery work for the United States Air Force working with Pilots accelerating them in a centrifuge and they would block out this part of their training and 2 days 3 G's for G's boom out to go at at some point like 10 Gee's and most of them have these little dream what states that he called them which are kind of like I saw a tunnel floating out of the seat and having these sort of weird experiences and we know brain blasting to go your brain stem of course keep you alive so the cortex of shutting down from the outside in that would create this kind of tunneling effect in the back of your skull or your visual cortex is that would create some of that open brain surgery seizure on epileptic patients where they cut them open and they poke around to see where the seizures are starting and so they could zap those neurons instead of some big crude attack and anyways so while they're doing that to get permission from the patient to wake him up while they're on and the brain is open and they tap around with electrodes so this is one way to map with the brain is doing if so what do you report when I tap hero I just had a vision of my 10th birthday or whatever it's like okay that's where that that's start right there another spot right on the temporal lobe just above your ears where you can tap it and the person says oh I'm floating out of my bottom up by the ceiling now and you tap a little to the left on my left leg is at my right leg is at night my left arm is floating my right arm way up in here now I'm coming back down just by you know with a rheostat just controlling how much electricity is going into the neurons and that one particular spot so we know for sure that the near-death experiences are in the brain that experiences that the people report a real they have experience but we know it's neurologically based now the counterargument is yes of course you have to have your brain to have experiences but it's kind of like a doors of perception opening into this other Realm these chemicals allow you to do it's like by the way I've been talking with the Graham Hancock about he's invited me to come join him and arrhythmia in Costa Rica to try this and I've never tried this and I'm tempted to go do this to say okay let's I'm going to write about these things I should or does it open some door to some other dimension okay that's and the near-death experience Believers counter that will yes it's in your brain but it still is taking you somewhere else the problem is is that how you tell the difference between I had a personal experience that the only way you can share it is if you actually go through it yourself for a scientific community that studies it well there should be some way to test it somehow or tell the difference between that sell for can you dealing with memories and dreams and ideas like you can't measure those either that's right so the most famous example is that even Alexander's trip to Heaven he wrote a book called proof of heaven now this is a harvard-trained neurologist he knows more about the Brandon I do and so he knows all the research I'm talking to you about and there's a lot more powerful sou Texas tripping the colors were unbelievably intense and Rich I felt just deep personal love for the people I saw on and Oneness with the cosmos and about this quote from Oliver Sacks Memoir when he talks about in the sixties when he was dropping acid and then the colors were incredibly intense and I had this incredible feeling of love and connected and I quote from Sam Harris's the opening pages of waking up and took ecstasy and I'm sitting there in watching my buddy and all of a sudden I feel as intense love for my friend that you and the narratives are indistinguishable to an outsider so how do you know that you're actually going to heaven or you're just having a fantastic trip once entirely possible it's both going through chemical doorways that are created by these molecules and that it experiences some frequency on the on the dial if there's a radio dial maybe we're at 95.5 but if you can get 297 if you take you know x amount of milligrams of diamond a tryptamine and then you go to this new place physically here not true I don't know but that's the idea yet sounds good getting at is super cork problem of what is truth definition personal and you can't corroborate them through some external scientific method so I mean Science is based on the that's true because I experienced that you know so I wrote a column inside of America mouth is called what is true that I start off with like why the truth for me is that dark chocolate better than milk chocolate and maybe you say milk chocolate slide there from into things like these personal experiences we have so you know so what I think gram is hoping if I go to with me and try Ayahuasca and I say while I report this fantastic experience I had presumably I'll have this and then it'll be well did I go to this other dimension and now I really kind of as a skeptic need to renounce my pure materialistic monistic belief in and admit there's a dualistic that's another side is a spirit side or something cancel my pure materialistic monistic belief in in in in admit there's a dualistic that's another side is a spirit side or something and I'm not at all sure I could do that because how would I get out of my own head and say I know for sure that that I went to this other place cuz I wouldn't know</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what's so fascinating to me when you think about people that explore the boundaries of what a human body capable of and strong man is like what is like guys who do you like David Goggins to do like the ultramarathons but strong man is like that's another form of this extreme pushing of the boundaries of what is capable I've gotten even like the weights keep getting heavier every year everybody keeps getting faster and I don't like all the time when the f*** is this going to stop you know like we show up to a contest right there was literally contest in 2018 where the devil's was 880 lb for wraps the log press world record is 502 lb overhead right now you know it's just like these crazy outlandish numbers but like the people like we keep doing them so I guess we're doing it to ourselves to point I guess so but do you like what is pushing is it just it you is it a preconceived idea what's possible and now that the bar has been moved and now you realize it or is it just a people or more tific about their training now that's what it is I think it's and it's also like when it did the evolution of equipment over the years you know like with Rogue being warm and Equipment sponsor now they make all strongman equipment so like regular people have strongman equipment in their gyms you know you're like PT clinics that have Farmers Handles in them for people to work on core musculature and talk to her when they're walking so I think just like the general availability of strongman equipment has made it easier for people to train it more regularly and get better at the event you look me up a practice you know like being strong is great but you have to be able to manipulate the movement and manipulate the Implement to work and that's where just like the training in the practice at portion of it comes in so I think that's why we've seen you know a lot of these weights being pushed so much further because everybody pretty much as regular access to these Norman influence now like how long have people been doing this when was the first Strongman Competition I mean strong that dates back to like a 1700 really to look at old you know quote" strong men doing these Feats of Strength one of the most notable names is Louis cyr Canada who was about my size actually and is revered to be one of the strongest man in history and so he was doing like these dumbbell lifts in these baculus these hipnthigh list and stuff like that so strong that's been around for a long time but world Strongest Man didn't become a thing until the 70s that's one world Strongest Man 77 was the first year and that's when it kind of became a sport no not just a kind of a hobby I guess so how do they determine what stuff you're going to do for the World's Strongest Man did they mean did they have a panel of experts at sit down and devised each individual event would like potato sack races back at World's Strongest Man a long time ago now it's little more standardized where they do have like a committee where it's Nino people from the strongman circuit and judges and stuff like that but they also bring TV execs cuz they want stuff that's going to look cool you know Bea and I think that's a great thing because you don't want us like stuff that is cool to me isn't going to look cool to somebody that doesn't want him out the sports sometimes so when they choose the events like pulling two monster trucks like okay one it's you have to be strong as f*** to be able to do it but also looks really cool on TV I love both of those things to make it the most pleasing to the average person occult but also impressive exactly like the deadlift event they don't have us this is one of the world records that he did and how old is he and he's just chilling and you just have to hold it as long as you can have his f****** shoulders yeah that is preposterous it's dumb that dude has Preposterous muscles deep and heavy or an event like this it sucks 30 that is crazy that's exactly it to Black tongue cracked and outlying amazing so with with an event like that it's more just rely try to relax and getting into like a comment estate because you don't want to be super revved up because you're not moving you're just focusing on your grip and that's the biggest thing for an event like that but then there's also events were like okay when your max in your deadlift you do have to hold your breath right so it's different for everything you do look at it police system in the gym so you just like regular handles that use them like a cable machine set up a pulley on like a squat rack or like one of the Rogue rigs have a loading pins coming down stack weights on that and then just pull up holds like that hangs from a barbell barbell from a pull-up bar how long can you dead hang for a minute that's impressive of guys that heavy so I woke up my shoulders usually get tired</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> do presidential candidates everything before we got to love his energy like him as a person a lot he's like he's real you know he's like most politicians are aliens and he's not and it's so refreshing and who is this rational he's great and one of the things that is so like refreshing about him is that the I don't know if I've been in a room in the past year with so many former Bernie and for former Trump people which are a lot of his supporters you know we're like disaffected disappointed Trump people and then people that supported Bernie in 2016 and there's just I don't know like when you hear him talk the villain of his stump speech is not Donald Trump even though he hates Donald Trump the villain is Amazon and big Pharma and you do automation like the things that are actually transforming and decimating the country this emotional Journey with Biden where it first I'm like totally like I liked him then I'm like old kind of losing it no way he can win and now I feel like I've gone back to maybe like you cuz he's way too old I will be very surprised if the candidate is not Bernie both because of the fundraising and because of where he is in the polls and because and this is the most fundamental thing the the energy in the country right now is a populist energy and I just don't think that a moderate like the ones that I like like Klobuchar abiding can capture that the energy of the base I think it I think that energy is just really you have a f****** and put Elizabeth Warren in and it's only going to have a hard time when someone is the sitting president who is extremely controversial extremely polarizing but also we're in a great time economically that's hard for people to deviate from it's hard for people to deviate from good economy when you look at the stock market when you look at a lot of things that you could point to the standard issues that you point to and then you deal with all this Lunas on the left that Trump is the complete opposite of you he's being a little finger exactly when he got it off as I said political correctness just got hit with a missile to the dick that's what it was like when that guy got an office like what the f*** he just want after all that grab the p**** stuff and all that all the craziness behind the fact that he was able to weather that storm and it didn't even seem to shake them if you don't like me I get loud you know we know what we really need that guy know we need Trump as president it's going to be hard it's going to be it's always hard to get someone out of office I mean what song George HW Bush was Ross Perot in a lot of people forget that Ross Perot this eccentric billionaire got on television and bought an entire half hour of regular Primetime television and put on this display why you're getting f***** and explain taxes to you and explain Mike Bloomberg going to be the Ross Perot of 20/20 it doesn't make sense he doesn't make sense I don't think he's he's wasting his time just think he's the opposite of what people want they don't want that ever existed if you catch them in their worst moment and you magnify those moments and you cut out everything else and you only display display those worst moments that's you can't find very many with Bernie he's been insanely consistent his entire life he's basically been saying the same thing and for the same thing his whole life and that in and of itself is a very powerful structure to operate from and he's addressing the thing that people are most obsessed with right now which is economic and equality and he's a really consistent on it resume normal winning now but did you like him I was a huge Division and people I know either they love him or they really really think that he's like graph of noxious all of that I know you don't like Tulsi I love her I love her I love her think she's awesome I love her I love Bernie and I love Andrew Yang and I talked about calcium periodate I forgot to bring up Andrew Yang I apologize for that I said everybody else can eat s*** I didn't mean and I really I do like it was just a mistake when is the Tulsa appeal for you well I think she first of all is someone who served twice overseas been deployed twice and understands the actual cost of War worked in you know medical units saw people murdered and shot down and ended destroyed by War and she wants none of it she wants us to have less intervention interventionist foreign policy decisions that affect people's lives and send our young brothers and sisters over there to go that's one thing she's a person who served in Congress you understand that work is a very nice friendly person I believe her when I talked to her she's very genuine you know and you know if you want a woman president that's that's what you want you want a young woman who has served in Congress who has served overseas been deployed she makes a lot of sense with a lot of things she sang that's what I like about it got it 0 painting on her I like her 0 purissima though in your life and until things are really popping where I have to pay attention to her I'm just like she ain't got shot together would be a f****** devastating combination I really do I don't know if they'd ever work out together I don't know if that's possible but I think them together might work that might work. Might get enough people to go you know what this is all just too f****** crazy let's let's try something different calling a Russian asset like under strange that Hillary Clinton said that I do but I know I'm not a fan of Hillary Clinton I'm not a fan of that hole I did there a part of a different world right there a part of a different world where corruption was open and accepted and it was a part of the program and if you pay attention to the Clinton Foundation you pay attention to the the amount of money that they would get paid to speak to Bankers in the fact they wouldn't release the transcripts that was a great thing about Bernie during the 2016 election who is the transcripts transcripts Larry David and it was like it was very strange that I'm literally looking in there but him as a human being when I was hanging out with him believe in him I like him I like him a lot I know that scandalous thing about in The Daily Mail just like with like Bernie Sanders he request his Junior Suites in his hotels to be 65° and he asks his staff to collect honey packets Soviet Union for Nicaragua I mean his foreign policy stuff disaster and that's what that is what Trump will crush him on Trump wants Bernie to be the candidate would be great to Rock I mean he's foreign policy stuff disaster and that's what the depth that is what Trump will crush him on Trump wants Bernie to be the candidate would be great to</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I think it's really good about church is the community yes I mean this to me connect to the thing that we open by talking about which is polarization and tribal you know the tribal politics for a living and I think you've had Jonathan haidt on the show and really in about this that we were evolved to be religious creatures in a certain way and what happens when we lose religion that impulse go somewhere that impulse has gone into you know politics you know it's like why are the stakes of that so unbelievably High because that is sort of the operating system that people are organizing their life around more and more to convince people that are on convincible if they're you know I think fighting for the idea of God is sort of a losing argument in the culture so how do we retain the good things that came from religious structures in a post god age I think that's a huge question what are what are people really wary of 1 things are wary of is the recluse right where we're aware of the Unabomber weary of that guy who lives in the woods and it doesn't the isolationist doesn't need anybody else there by themselves like will that person doesn't follow by the rules of our community will what are we comfortable about a comfortable love friendly neighbors we're comfortable I can't you need help you need me to help dig out of the snow do you need this do you need that like that's what we loved right cuz then and we love people that share our values right we like to live in a community of shared values because then you like you're all we're all comforting each other all saying we're all in this together we have hardships we going to have a good time but the the will have more good times will be able to get through the hardships if we operate together with similar values living in an age where people are completely isolated you know everyone on the campaign Trail talking about the diseases of Despair and how the lifespan in this country has gone down for the past 3 life expectancy has gone down the past 3 years be remembered is an unbelievably transformative time and Trump is only one data point like he's a symptom and he's a catalyst but he's not the whole picture and to see him as a whole picture I think it's just like completely missing the moment that were in a lot of what's going on here and I mean what you said the people enjoying when people can speak their mind when people see Ricky Gervais get up at the Golden Globes yes yes Chappell's like Chappelle was something like 20% favorable know it was 00 and again and again and I just wonder like how that resolves itself or maybe it doesn't it suck when you have I come to meet the common man when we talk and people listen to reasonable discussion then they feel more emboldened to have reasonable discussion of their own maybe perhaps some private maybe I just f****** put tin foil over the window Bolt the door shot make sure they can talk honestly it isn't worth living in the freest Society in human history and people are acting like the Stasi is looking over their shoulder what would it look like if all the journalists at the Washington Post New York Times and Wall Street Journal were banned from being on Twitter circular thing where we all know the landmines right like the things we don't want to touch like the hills we don't want to die on and it's what's scary about the Stasi like atmosphere of it is like my job is to write opinion columns and commission other people to do that and yet I feel the self-censoring even before I've written right round like wait I don't want to die on that Hill I don't want to unlock is that really the battle I want to take on I should probably just stick to this topping instead of that topic because I know if I do that topic like I know what awaits me like why am I why would I willingly go to the guillotine well that's what's weird about your position because you're an opinion writer right and that's what you do when you're not allowed to give your honest opinion in a lot of people's eyes they want you to be compliant with woke culture and I think one of the reasons that I get in a lot of trouble or and provocative or whatever the words that go before my name or whenever I mentioned now controversial is because I you know I think more than others I refuse to follow the rule because what's the point like role confusion the crowned like I'm not going to waste my life following some fake rule determined by random people on the internet and like this desire for you to comply I mean this is part of the game that's going on when people don't have control their own lives they love to control other people's lives and one of the things that happens when you have an opinion that does not follow the whatever the path has been clearly grooved for us to when you you're supposed to have very specific ideas about these very clearly Define subject when you deviate from those and people start attacking you they're the ones are trying to do and many of them is a lot of what they're trying to do this it's new ones but one of things are trying to do with a trying to get you to listen to them so that they have some power they feel powerless in the world and if they can push your button if they can break your glass have some power they're also trying to issue a warning right they're issuing a warning to the people in their group saying if you deviate we're going to do to you what we're doing to her right now and you know and it just like what's sad about it it's like the number of young people I know who are so talented and you know where our dogs or just independent minded people like liberals they choose not to choose not to become public people like they decide not to go into journalism not to do company not to do any number of things because like why would you choose to you know being that Arena if this is what it means</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I love the fact they said that it's racist when he calls her Pocahontas racist political judgment when she decided to publicly go through the DNA in the 23andMe or whatever it was approved that she was in fact partially Native American it was like just dude back off from behind forever now no matter what but now at least it's off the table she showed the slightest sliver of Native American Elizabeth Warren's not the candidate that's not going to be what he hits her with every single time for sure but it would be more on the table if she's never taken a DNA test for sure if you lie about being Dutch okay it's like you know it's kind of a cool daphna City but it's not that but you lie about being Native American it's different because like they're one of the most maligned and repressed people's ever in in recorded history I mean they were wiped off the face of the map and stuck into these little pockets of land that don't have strong natural resources I mean I've been I'm on my fifth book in the last three months are Native Americans became obsessed Empire of the summer Moon book on the Comanches and it is f****** incredible it's incredible when you realize like that this was going on in this country just a hundred and fifty years ago and that for hundreds of years the Comanches just dominated the West they dominated the plains in until they invented a gun that can shoot more than one bullet the the white men with us the Comanches with just dominate them cuz he could shoot our left an hour and they were just a ferocious people that know artwork no beadwork they just they just made teepees like they'd really they weren't they didn't have like a lustrous like works of art and beautiful can them with the with the Comanches World War people they they rated they hunted the ate mostly meat all they ate was me they did barely they didn't Farm didn't do any farming there's roamed around killed and just dominated the entire Western half of this country for hundreds and hundreds of years cuz they were the first ones to figure out how to ride horses they were the first ones to not to figure out how to ride horses but to to raise horses animal husbandry they they they figured out how to accumulate large Stables of horses and ride them better than anybody could you need to read that the woman out there that's on the wall that the outside they didn't need American woman is breastfeeding woman a baby and Parker Cynthia Ann Parker was she was abducted by the Comanches when she was 9 years old and then became accepted as a part of the tribe and then went on to be the wife of the major cheap one of the major Comanche Chiefs and then was kidnap back by the United States when she was 30 but she didn't want to be a whole lot but the history of the Bison in the United States in the Native Americans that would travel with the Bison all these different tribes that would they basically coexisted with the Bison just moving bison as they migrated in hunting the bison and I was just like one strange thing that these people lived in the Stone Age but fantastic way with all these myths and legends and stories and have so much magic in their life and then all that's gone all that's gone and now we just like that but that's a big deal magical cultures in a lot of ways because the day did horrific things to each other there's no doubt about the Comanches were f****** ruthless to each other to other Native American tribes they they went on war constantly of a rating each other constantly kidnapping abducting murdering I mean there was this has no like this idea of Native Americans being like the way they lived was but fascinating fascinating and powerful and they had their very strict rules and codes of operating that were very unlike the Western world and they were invaded they were invaded and dominated and killed off by disease and then ultimate I mean there was neither were shooting Buffalo to starve the Indians out there was a lot of crazy s*** that went down so when she comes out and says you know Ohio grub Native American. The f*** you did the f*** you did and the more books I read now I'm on Black Elk speaks which is my favorite one so far because Black Elk speaks is an actual man named blackout who is a iguala Sioux medicine man Lakota medicine man who in the 1930s told his story so he was alive when he was there when Custer was murdered the Sioux were forced into reservations he's telling the story of them going from living this nomadic life to be enforcing these reservations reservations and starving and alcoholism and all that they chaos that came with it so then this one is this one's the best because it's literally his words to get a direct translation he's talking to his son his son is talking to the author in the book was written the 1930s right now with someone but we're working on that right now we're reaching out to a couple different Native American groups to try to find a good representative representative to come in and talk about what you know their grandparents and the stores that they had heard yeah it's it's crazy subject and it's to me pretending you're anything is not good but pretending your Native American to me is like whoa that's because that's one where everybody it's there's like a spiritual the aspect Native Americans it's implied like you say your Native American people to Hawkeye f****** knows things you're allowed to have feathers you can have a non ironic dreamcatcher on your wall you know it's like cosplay as ya from their great-grandparents and also the thing about Parker right Cynthia Ann Parker was 0% Native American but she was 100% Indian she still was a Native American Eve cuz she's a abducted when she was 9 and live their life she wanted to go back and get her words you know when when when she's describing the difference like the command world was filled with magic and gods the water was a guy the sky was a God everything was it was magic lets you would do his rituals that would do to protect themselves in combat and all these things made life fantastic this to the hunting of the buffalo in the nomadic way of life and then all sudden to be locked into these buildings and wearing these clothes and stuck Within These rituals that the white men would were live she didn't want to have any part of that so even though like you know was Cynthia Ann Parker's if she had sex with a white man and made a white baby that is not a Native American baby but it kind of is you know I mean in terms of culture she's she was 100% all in Comanche when they eventually abducted her back amazing stuff so f*** Elizabeth warranty that crazy Native American talk to her maybe she didn't know she was 1 mm Native American think I don't know she's she's an expert and and she's clearly did pulled her aside and in private and said a woman can never be president tell me how you saw that moment well the CNN moment was very interesting right when she walked up to him in this very public way that I think you just called me a liar and a thief it's incredible I think it was a ploy I don't buy it he's been her Ally forever and to me it shows a sign of great disloyalty and great dishonesty like the way she did it she did it as it's a ploy like ideally her and him could be allies and she could be GNC together you should be allies right he's a powerful force in the Democratic party she's a powerful force in the Democratic Party from like many years ago where he said that a woman is never going to win all the time which is can a woman win Bernie gave an answer that probably let a lot of people giving those conversations which is Maybe not maybe the American people are too sexist to elect a woman like that's possible if she meant that in an observational way not at any judgment on who she is or the capability of a woman to be president and she heard it in the negative way of almond can be president strategy on your part that backfired that's not a question but I also think that you know I have those conversations every day can a woman be present while they have these ideas about what a president is and a president is an older male who is well-spoken and educated who understand this many factors yeah a&amp;n lot of other AR right now and you aren't you working man Andrew Yang is like experience what are cyclist mayor is now running for president I mean she came hard she went hard the that was the real problem with it was it it was obviously calculated it didn't it when people are talking if someone said look if he was like a closet misogynist can't win or maybe not made any sense was not anything sexist or misogynist I say sometimes I ask out loud to my friends I don't know if a woman can't win for president will Hillary won the popular vote if you and I were just sitting around having a cup of coffee and we're just talkin we just talk and then I went and when I decide against this is a statement I'm saying right now I don't know what my next word is going to be alright everyone knows that we we all know that when we're talkin it's learning through reading a speech or if you have like a very clear doctrine that you liked this is my this is my idea of the world let me let thought this through very carefully down and I like to share it with you I'm going to hold you to that and then if you change that opinion I'd like you to tell me why you changed it and tell me why you why you were wrong but that's different you talk maybe that's what he said you know maybe that's upset and then she's like he privately told me a woman can never be present</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> what we're talking about with anti-Semitism one of the reasons why it's always been so confusing to me is because it seems to be this there's a lot of these white supremacists that they did they lean in that door they lean towards anti-Semitism first like almost it's almost more acceptable is almost more like they think they can get away with it they'll find more support online like if you say online in a lot of these forums like if you say hey we got to get rid of all these black people you're going to just going to be so many more red flags then if you say we have to get rid of Jews I don't understand that one because it's when people look different from you if you are an Asian person who is racist against black people or a black person is racist against white people or if someone is different than racism racism is always disgusting it's always horrific and ignorant but at least I can kind of see how you could be tricked into thinking that way I don't understand anti-Semitism list in times of economic and social upheaval the reason that anti-Semitism is resurgent right now is because I'm not justifying it but it's because we're in going back to our earlier conversation a time where people are disoriented their disaffected they're confused their shortchanged and they're looking for an easy answer which is a huge huge huge idea that anti-Semitism is built into the scaffolding of Western Civilization. It's never going away it's like think about it like an intellectual disease that's built into the foundations of the civilization that we live in and in times where that Civilization or that's a given Society is healthy anti-Semitism along with xenophobia and racism and all kinds of other bigotry or sort of kept in check and it when the society becomes unhealthy and we're living in a deeply unhealthy Society many different ways right now anti-Semitism is something that people reach for right it's like if you want understand like the Nazi rise to power you kind of can understand it without looking to the fact that there was you know when incredible economic depression in Germany and there was a scapegoat and if you look not to justify it but if you look throughout history right look at the Bubonic plague the Bubonic plague came because of rats to the European continent brought on ships from Crimea but people did not at the time they looked white who did they blame they blame the Jews the Jews were dying at a lesser rate than their non-jewish neighbors probably because of religious rituals that use have like washing your hands before you break bread and say a blessing dunking in the ritual bath before the Sabbath and all of these other things that probably kept them more protected against the plague than their Neighbours would rather than looking in and saying oh maybe they're doing something right and something we should mimic their neighbors said kill the juice to it literally like throw the Jews down the well and it led to you do massive programs killing Jews for an in the claim was that the Jews literally poisoned the drinking water throughout Europe so it's like it's this irrational hatred but it is so so deep because it goes back to the most important myth that Western Civilization is built on it is the Christian story Jewish people are it's it's it makes a lot of sense but the fact it still continues to accept as a foundational principle that this is baked into the world that we live in and we're never going to cure it and it's never going to go completely away the best thing that we can do is build healthy cultures that protect certain virtues like Liberty like freedom of the individual like religious liberty all the state like it's not a coincidence that has been so good for the Jews it's because so many of the ideas that protect minorities and religious minorities like Jews was for all of their fault for all of the founders false right and they had many including owning people but you know George Washington in his this letter to the first Jewish community of this country and Rhode Island and he said something that was been incredibly radical which is pathetic that it was but he says new Jews in America are not just going to be tolerated they're going to possess the same the same citizenship as everyone else. At the time was a radical departure from history in the Islamic world the Jews that always lived as dimi's a second-class citizen and in the car world it was worse and what would people forget right is like right now radical Islam when it comes to the religions is the greatest threat to Jews but for most of its history Islam was much more tolerant of Jews than Christianity was which is something that's kind of like has gotten lost to history</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> Wichita clay book the way it opens is so we should tell people that you are from transitioning at the temple where the Pittsburgh shooter and so that was just tell people which is like pretty much down the street from Mister Rogers like was quite literally Mister Rogers Neighborhood he's from there and was amazing place to grow up I became apartments on 1997 and it happened at tree of life I actually was a member of a different synagogue called Beth Shalom but there had been this fire until all of the kids who were becoming a bar Bat Mitzvah that year did it at tree of life and you know in the same way that people about 9/11 as a date I think about also October 27th 2018 because that morning I was in Arizona to give a speech to a group and I looked at my phone around 10 in the morning to like my family WhatsApp chat and my youngest sister had just said there's a shooter tree of life and my thought immediately went to my dad because my dad is kind of what we think of it like a promiscuous Jew like he goes to different synagogues he has membership dues at various ones he likes the sermons that one in the the scotch another and I thought there was a good possibility that he was there thank God he was not there but my mom won't back you know we're going to know people there my dad knew most of the people 11 people were killed it was the most lethal anti-semitic attack in all of American History I knew several of the people that were killed when it ended up I was supposed to actually go to Israel the next day on a reporting trip to report on this fast archaeological dig but I ended up putting that trip off doing that story later and just spending the week to see what happened what happens to a community when when something like this goes down because like we read about mass shootings all the time right so much so that they become kind of an abstraction and I you know I don't report on this stuff so I had never borne witness to what unfolds and it was it was a really transformative week and I right in the book but I feel like in retrospect I had spent my life on a kind of holiday from history both because I was you know I'm a Jew of the post-war era which is to say the part of the luckiest diaspora in all of Jewish history like the Jews since the end of World War II in this country have had it better than we've ever had it ever before and all of the kind of Mythology about what America could be the idea that it's a City on a Hill the idea that it's a New Jerusalem like I was raised on those ideas and even though anti-semitic things happen to me like speaking of Catholic School like I would wait for the school bus to my Jewish Day School with my sister and there was this Catholic school bus that would drive by and they would scream you know Pikes and dirty Jews and wear your horns and I remembered High School people someone telling me to pick up pennies like things happened but it all kind of like didn't register it really rolled off my back because I saw those vestiges from earlier and ugly or time like something that those people should be embarrassed about not something that said anything about me and you know even after Pittsburgh though I was kind of like you could still delude yourself into thinking like this is a one-off it shouldn't change you know the fundamental jewish-american assessment of our experience here and our place of belonging here but then six months later to the to the day there's another white attack on a synagogue in Poway California and then we've had you know that we've had this rash of violent anti-semitic attacks happening in the New York area which I hope will talk about but you know it's weird because I grew up in a very political family like my my dad's a little obsessed with politics were always talking about politics and and we're always talking about like Jews right like we're really proud Jewish Family and so it wasn't that I thought anti-Semitism had died like I was you know I watched anti-Semitism as it was sort of resurging and countries like France and England in Western Europe but I sort of looked at all of that with a with some level of distance and maybe even a little condescension like we're sort of inoculate it from that disease in America America singular America is sort of separate from the tragedy of so much of Jewish history I have to say that like it sounds naive but I was sort of shocked to see it that it's here to you knowing that we haven't escaped from it and that'll weakening happened a little bit before Pittsburgh which is it happened I think it was April 2017 you correct me when was the Charlottesville March member of the unite the right March shouting blood and soil like Boonton Boudin which is a Nazi slogan you will not replace us and when I heard that you like the Jews will not replace us right I heard it in like the plain meaning of that phrase like the Jews not going to take my job the Jew is not going to like take my job in the corner office or whatever but in fact it was like best replacement Siri ideology which is that brown people and black people and Muslims and immigrants are coming to replace our white civilization and the the the Jews job is basically to pass as a white person but in fact do the bidding of these people that we deem to be not pure where where's our come from that is a deeply deeply ancient anti-semitic conspiracy theory right it's the idea liquor back to New Testament let's go back to to Jesus right what happened in that story the story there is that the Jews go to Pontius Pilate and say you know like this person's unacceptable to us and in the mythology of that story the Jews get what we've been the most powerful Empire in the world the Roman Empire to do their bidding and you had this line in the Book of Matthew that is also I mean the bloodiness of this line cannot be Quantified where he says you know his blood be on us and on our children which goes you know down through the centuries to justify the killing of a view of Untold numbers of Jews but the idea of the Jew as sort of likable Wiley manipulator as a Jew as having proximity to power not being in power but being able to sort of be the Puppet Master pulling the levers of power see that play out in lots of different iterations Through Time right you see it I'm trying to think about useful examples for your listeners but but that is sort of the Trope right and it is an ancient one but it's being utilized in really new ways so it's not literally that the Jew is going to replace it is that the Jew who the Jew and away is sort of like the greatest trick the devil played mrs. the language of Eric worre who wrote this amazing essay called Skin In the game and he talks he says he's a black anti-racist activist and he talks about figuring out how anti-Semitism is kind of the linchpin of white supremacy because the Jew appears to be white but in fact he's not white I mean this is all based on this live at race is not a social the race is not a contract right it's is not white but he appears to be but in fact you loyal to these people who are coming to sell the America and so when you have someone like Congressman Steve King saying we can't replace our civilization with someone else's babies like what does that mean what is that idea it is so deeply anti-American because the idea of America right is the idea that American this is not about bloodline American this is about a shared set of values and ideas and fealty to those ideas so the idea that someone else has big what does that mean she did those ideas so the idea that someone else has been what does that mean</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> this amazing guy last night who we're talking about he grew up in Egypt Hussein aboubakr is his name he's really incredible grew up in Egypt and was you know he was like I was swimming and anti-Semitism I just didn't even know it wasn't normal like the mosque I went to the school I went to it was like the Jews were the supervillain and the whole message was like become a superhero and going killing to feed the juice and he would like normal normal school this is what I was taught and I never met at you in my life and he gets arrested during the Arab Spring because he starts learning Hebrew online he's really curious about who the Jews are and he gets arrested I think they're suspicious that he designed a spy anyway he end up getting Asylum he lived here in LA like a public profile as a Jew you don't want to go looking online for my name and somebody's forums it's like really skinny but you look at it now there are people who look at it for me and tell me what I need to like be aware of any like every cynic Ivory synagogue I speak to it's like people don't realize that I went to a synagogue Friday night in La like there's armed guards at every synagogue and I go to now it's like going through TSA to go to imagine that if most Americans had to do that when they went to church like we think that's insane but that is the State of Affairs for Jews and Jews that I know hide evidence of their identity everywhere they go I was a woman who wrote me who was reading my book on the subway in New York and was like I'm nervous to be seen reading a book with the title in public and like hit it but I understand why because it's it's become so regular and everyone else just living their normal life and we're like sounding the alarm here because if there's one thing that you have gotten really good at it's like we have an instinct for danger like that is something that we have cultivated over years of being discriminated against persecuted against nearly wiped off the map in Europe like we understand and we smell danger sometimes before other people do you think that they're just more Jews on the east coast and the West lava juice out here there are ya there are I don't know I don't live out here so I'm not sure I also think it's different right like there different kinds of anti-Semitism like their kind that we've talked about that comes on the far-right expresses itself one way and there's also anti-Semitism that comes smuggled into the mainstream through the political left that comes cloaked in language that is very seductive like the language of social Justice and progress and if the right claims that the Jews are you know fake white people the far-left claims that the Jews are handmaidens to white supremacy so whiteness please like a really really key role in the way that anti-Semitism functions right. That's why anti-Semitism is a shape-shifting conspiracy theory except that right and that is how under Nazism Jews are the race contaminators how under communism we are the arch capitalist right how under the idea of white supremacy we are these fake white people right we appear to be white people but we're actually doing the bidding of these groups who white supremacist view to be lesser than black people brown people Muslims immigrants and how in the far left the Jews are seen as sort of the great what is the greatest evil right now to the far-left whiteness and white privilege and Jews are seen as word of handmaidens to that why cuz of our success because many of us are of Eastern European descent 85% of American Jews are of Ashkenazi which is east of Eastern European descent so we pass as white so we have white privilege and so in the intersectional view of the world right which reverses the caste system that we've been living in until now you have some of my Jon Hamm at the very top and black transgender disabled people the very bottom will be intersectional worldview comes around in Reverse is that and says no Jon Hamm cisgendered white men like Joe Rogan or now at the very bottom and at the very top or the transgender black disabled person is aware of the Jews in that new intersectional caste system of the world we're kind of like right above Jon Hamm we're right near him because we have we enjoy all of those were two privileges that he enjoys it's a crazy thing but that's sort of where we are yes I understand what you're saying and it will I see it with people were they open the express disdain for Jewish people I've seen it from a lot of people that you would call activists you know of a very religious identity drill they believe that Israel is dominating Palestine and that Hezbollah is misunderstood and then there's there's all these different sentiments expressed openly in these left circles which is Zionism is racism which is an unbelievable thing to say because Jordy of Jews who live in Israel or Jews of North African and Middle Eastern descent they are non-white people they are Arabs they are Arab Jews and yet you have the far left basically exporting parochial domestic American racial Politics on to a foreign conflict and place that they know absolutely nothing about you know these people are delusional they think that like all of the conflict in the Middle East would be resolved if only we took this one tiny conflict between this tiny group of people and their neighbors were in fact it's like a tiny local conflict in this huge drama of the Middle East of which there are a zillion players and you know the Jews of Israel are only one tiny part of it tiny conflict between this tiny group of people and their neighbors were in fact it's like a tiny local conflict in this huge drama of the Middle East of which there are a zillion players and you know the Jews of Israel are only one tiny part of it</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> the Zionist thing is Define the difference between Jewish Jewish and zionists Zionist is the idea of that the Jews have a right to National self-determination the Jewish Shakin Goin the Bible right like it's all over there the whole idea of discounted discount God whatever the fact is is that the Jews are a people that were birthed sort of in this land which we now call the land of Israel and they somehow and they were expelled by the Romans around 2,000 years ago and then they came back to that land right it's it's like they defy the logic of history in doing that because by All rights they were indigenous group to that land they were kicked expelled and then we went back to thousand years later like it's a crazy extraordinary story so leave that to one part Zionism the way that I am the way that I I think it's the simplest definition is the belief in the Jewish right to self-determination and it's the Jewish Liberation movement and so in the night let's go back to like pre 1948 which is the year that the state of Israel is established and you have Jews in you know pull all of these other places debating like what is the way that we can solve our constant systemic oppression that we are constantly enduring and they're all of these different responses to that problem one argument was the Socialist argument you know if we are that you know the anti-capitalist argument if the problem is capitalism and if only we defeat capitalism anti-Semitism will go away some argued that total assimilation was the right way to solve that we just need to kind of disappear as juice that's the only way we'll be fully accepted another group you know which was not even the most popular group is this idea of we need to be able to determine our own fate and the only will never be fully accepted the only way that we can determine our own fate is if is this idea of us having our own State and our own Army where we can protect ourselves and that is ultimately the idea that sort of wins out so when you're having a debate about and when people say today there in anti-zionist a problem that is there not making that argument in 1920s Eastern Europe when the state doesn't exist it's one thing to be an anti-zionist and Siri right it's the same thing analogy I like to make his if we're a couple and we want to have a baby and we're debating should we have the baby can we afford the baby where we can send the baby to school this stuff that's a totally moral argument to make you can't make that argument of should we have the baby after the baby is born the baby is born it exists is really exist it's a place it's not idea abstraction it is a place that contains the largest Jewish community on planet Earth and so when people say that Israel doesn't have a right to exist it's like what are you talkin about it exists so what do you want what so I ask the person that makes the untidiness argument what do you imagine will happen like are you do think that you're advocating for an genocide right away or like you have to have no sense of Middle Eastern history or politics to make the argument you can be a minority in that region without protection we know what that looks like that looks like the story of these CDs it looks like the story of the Kurds the story of the zoroastrians the story frankly if Christians were going to be completely expelled from the Middle East within the next decade which is a story no one talks about so the anti-zionist existing is real existing correct Whip and made this very playing where he actually said the words the BBC has a biased towards believing that Israel has a right to exist yes yes of like normative political progressivism but if you were an 18 year old and you go onto a college campus and you're like during the orientation week or signing up for like legalizing pot club and better rights for cafeteria workers oh and by the way you know the boycott divestment sanctions movement against Israel which is an anti-zionist movement you're not an anti-semite you don't hate Jews you're just kind of like swimming along with Progressive Waters because that's how successful this movement has been but if you step back and there's a political movement gaining popularity in the west that was in fact embodied in the person of Jeremy corbyn and what became of his leave a party that believes that there's only one state in the world that doesn't have a right to exist like that's crazy like I see what you doing I know what you're doing crushed horrible things we have that horrible policy to stay America shouldn't exist and we should just meld into Canada or Mexico by the way they're saying that they're making that argument in a contacts where they are literally surrounded by neighbors who want to murder as many Jews Jewish Israelis as possible like it anymore. I feel like it's it's an argument that I really can't wrap my mind around like how people get away with making it so strange concept even say that it doesn't have the right to exist when it does exist cracked so I could see what does he say Jeremy corbyn accused of anti-Semitism of a shocking 2011 video when she questions Israel's right to exist and says the BBC is biased in favor of the Jewish State questions are right to exist I could see how someone could say that there is evidence that some Israeli Israeli soldiers have done her everything's the Palestinian people have yes of course they have yes and I could see how you could look at the where Palestine is the state of the Palestinian people and saying there has to be a better way for them it has to be a better civilization for them has to ask him prove these are human beings they have it has to be a better just a better situation I mean they're not even recognized as a true state or as a true country by a lot of people so I can see that I believe that because I believe that also because I'm a Zionist I don't want the state of Israel and the state of it supposed to be inviting Jewish ideas to be occupying and other people like that is a state like that is horrible what can be done about here's the problem right we saw what happened in the we pull out from the Gaza Strip he pulled out completely all of the settlements from the Gaza Strip there's not a single Jew left there it's completely you didn't ride and yet Hamas is still sending tons of rockets from Gaza Strip into Israel the occupation there is ended it's over and that's still going on until then you have to ask yourself like did the average Palestinian like I believe that the average Palestinian I spent time in the West Bank talking to Palestinians whose lives are in this rated by the by the Israeli occupation like they just want to live a normal life you know and yet they're being held hostage I spoke to this young mother in Gaza who fled and she said to me on the phone we're being so rude and misery to twice you know once was by Israel and now by our own leaders by Hamas right these are like kleptocratic authoritarian regimes that hate women that hate gay people I mean it's horrible like life under these regimes is absolutely horrible so the problem is Israel then sees what happens in God's and they're like okay we're in this situation where we want to be a liberal democracy and yet were you know occupying another people it's an it's a untenable situation if you want to be a liberal democracy DocuSign other people the problem is is literally geographically if they pull out of the Westbank they will likely have another situation like they had in Gaza and now all of a sudden not only do you have Rockets going to Elsa's the country in places like steroid from Gaza you have rocket capable of reaching Tel Aviv and the population centers of Israel so what do you do what do you do I don't know does anyone know I do not have a rational course now really know any I think I think one of the places we've arrived here I dislike what did Palestinian nationalism really seek Western liberals like me want will for years I told myself I think this was certainly like the view of lots of experts that would Palestinian nationalism really wanted was a Palestinian State Palestinians just want self-determination like everyone else in the world and I am absolutely on board with that the problem is is that their leaders and then you look at some of these polls in the numbers are really disturbing and they say no the goal is not having our own State alongside Israel the goal is erasing Israel the goal is for Israel not to be right and then you look at the evidence of all of these peace offers that were in Oslo in Camp David and we can go on and on and they were all rejected so it's like he's the goal your own land and having a place of your own or is the national or have we told ourselves and I include myself in this a lie about what Palestinian nationalism or at least parts of it seek and that's really really upsetting to confront so the hardcore position from people like from Hezbollah is that Israel is stolen they do not want any Jewish State between the Jordan River in the Mediterranean Sea they believe that any Jewish presence in the Middle East is heretical in support of Israel militarily politically socially I'm trying to think of the right of knowledge e here I mean they're there night like these are these are terrorists groups unless you think Tara like terrorism is rational I don't think that anything is accentuated by it like I think they would think that about Israel whether or not the US was supporting Israel when you see a situation like that the conflict as much as possible right I do not believe right now you can resolve a conflict because Israelis who have lived through times where it was normal for buses and cafes to just blow up you know the number of people I know who were touched by the second intifada like I was there during times where you know they would just blow out down the street so like they have been thoroughly disabused of the idea that I think I think that many of them given up on the idea that there could be peace in the short-term so what can you do right now to make things a little bit better you can improve the economic life for people for Palestinians living in the West Bank and you can try and shrink the conflict meaning no settlement expansion and I would say pull out of some of the set of Jewish settlements that are like you know far-flung and that the Israeli Army is sort of protecting for no reason but I think that's the best case scenario for right now what is a place a book I think it's called out and catch 67 by Mika Goodman that I would recommend people that's about how to shrink the conflict and that for now being the best case scenario but again it's like why does you have to ask yourself like why does everyone in the world obsessed about this particular conflict they're 500,000 Palestinians living in Lebanon most of whom live in refugee camps and buy official Lebanese law or barred from the lawyers from being doctors for being accountants is it portable situation do you think most people in the world know about the situation of the Palestinian immiseration in Lebanon they don't even know Palestinians are in Lebanon or in Jordan they've no idea the reason is because Palestinian lives matter when the people that are hurting them or juice they don't seem to matter when the people that are hurting them or other Arabs that's one of the things that I wanted to talk to you about this acceptance of anti-Semitism almost globally is unique it's not it's a it's a weird racism or a weird discrimination it's weird it doesn't it doesn't parallel with any other sort of discrimination people aren't sitting around thinking about how you know left-handed people are Koreans are uniquely evil like they're sitting around thinking about that with regard to the Jews but there's going to be a certain amount of population certain percentage of the population matter what that's going to hold those beliefs and needs have been passed down for thousands of years and the challenge to keep society as like healthy as possible to keep those forces at Bay really I mean it's it's really it's unbelievable the extent to which it's it's become accepted like I'll give you an example like there was some in this is the way that doesn't present itself anti-zionism I think is a modern form one of the modern forms because it what else do you call a movement that says that the Jewish state that already exists does not have a right to exist like that sounds like oh that's like a cool fiery but it's like 8 exist they live there they are surrounded by people that want to murder them so what are you suggesting that it just like goes away like the effective it would be nothing less than unbelievable Bloodshed and yet lots of people in this world are going around say Colleen sells anti-zionist do you think the seems like almost a sentiment that gets expressed that hasn't been really examined so it's full of like lunatics just like our government just like any other normal country but it's like Israel's not treated like a normal country is treated in a way like this has the Super both superpowers to like a perfect peace in the Middle East and superpowers to like like a supervillain it's both at once people hate a country that doesn't exist and they love a country that doesn't exist they project themselves and their ideas of things on to this place and it's just like a normal country doesn't seem to be a way out of this because it it's an idea the hasn't been fully explored but has been Express so frivolously almost think about think about if there was a movement in the world that suggested that you know the Japanese Warner real people and the in Japan does not have a right to exist like think about how crazy that sounds a lot of people believe it's like if you think about think about if there was a movement in the world that suggested that you know the Japanese Warner real people and the in Japan does not have a right to exist like think about how crazy that sounds normal thing that a lot of people believe</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> is this really strange idea that people think that Jews caused anti-Semitism right like when the evil man who walked into the Walmart in El Paso talk about a Hispanic Invasion and then went into that Walmart and killed I think upwards of twenty people no one's thought maybe he's right maybe there is a Hispanic Invasion maybe that was like somehow Justified because he saw them as insular or isolated or looking out for each other do you know what I mean like I would be a crazy idea and yet when it comes to the Jews people are like well you know they wear their funny hats well you know they seem to you do be looking out for one another and like would you think you were that kind of rationalizations have the Tree of Life horrific Massacre do you think that people are saying that like hey there were there funny how people just looked at it like this is horrible does NASCAR stand in that case yes but not in the case of what's been going on in Brooklyn there we keep things like this is the result of communal friction as if you knew disputes over zoning laws cause someone to pick up a machete the size of a broomstick walk into a rabbi's house and hack people up or mentally disabled okay with the people that show up to services on time which is a certain kind of person and you have this white supremacist who says all Jews must die he totally unequivocal about it he and he goes in and he tries to do that so you have just a case of someone who any reasonable person sees his evil which is this Neo-Nazi and people who any reasonable person see is totally innocent which is in Jews in prayer was the guy the shooter killed no he's good he's standing trial and there were in NC actually embodied this thing sorry should I stop when they have some like that do they extensively interview him and try to figure out what the fuk brought him to that mean is he schizophrenic is he a lot of the people like the guy that the Munsey case that were going to talk about the machete guy he showed signs of mental illness I think that robber hours and Pittsburgh also did but you know but then so did dylann roof the guy that killed however many people he killed at the blackshirts church in Charleston South Carolina but he was also white supremacist it's like these hateful ideologies often they drop people that are deranged or young or somehow on the fringes of society with the guy in Pittsburgh he was deep into this replacement Siri ideology the reason that he selected tree of life is a synagogue is because tree-of-life the previous weekend had participated in this program called National Refugee Shabbat or Sabbath it was celebrating the idea of welcoming The Stranger which is a fundamental Jewish value do not oppress The Stranger because you were strangers in the land of Egypt and he said specifically that you know how is the group that with organizing this National Refugee Shabbat it stands for Hebrew immigrant Aid Society it started in the 1800 as a way of resettling Eastern European Jews were pogroms in Eastern Europe now works to resettle refugees including Jews all over the world and he specifically selected tree of life because of that because he said the Jews are bringing in the dirty immigrants into the society so he was like kind of the perfect embodiment of white supremacist replacement Siri ideas in Brooklyn it's much harder cases because it's much harder for people to talk about because of how do you talk about the fact that in many of these cases in a lot of them have been caught CCTV you know that it's a young black man attacking Hasidic guy walking down the street and who's visibly Jewish it's much harder to talk about when someone is someone who we talked about as being rightly as being a from a group that is himself victimized a poor black kid in Brooklyn is then going on to victimize another minority group it's just much harder when the attacker is not a white supremacist to talk about it one is a strange one but in some ways I think it's easier for ignorant people to look at them as the other because the way they clearly distinctly dress they dress so much different it's almost like if he had Amish people move in and they stuck to themselves they lived in one sort of community I think they would probably experience a similar level of hatred but then you add into it the sort of acceptance of anti-Semitism in a lot of communities it's like it's ramped up Steven in Crown Heights in Boro Park than before Caribbean's before lots of other communities then this knowledge like themselves expressions of the anti-semetic idea and people don't even realize it but I think there's also a genuine jealousy in the accomplishments and achievements of Jewish people you know I mean if you look at Nobel Prize winners from from Europe in particular I mean how many are European Jews it's f****** stunning you know it's stunning when you look at the amount of lawyers me just joke around about my Jewish lawyer you know I mean it's like a standard thing you think of doctors and how many successful and educated people are Jewish and that's one of things you actually touch it touch on in in your book you you were talking about I mean it's how people become in this country and there's got to be some sort of a resentment for that as well especially by again we're talking about mentally deranged people people with like severe some of them are mentally deranged but some of them are young some of them are that's it's really difficult about Sanibel is mentally ill by all accounts but he Googled you know like why did Hitler hate the Jews and he Googled various synagogues remember last time I was on there were those two or three black men who were members of this sect the Black Hebrew Israelites to Hebrew Israelites and everyone kind of laughed them off its like haha they're just this obnoxious weird stuff their ideology right the idea that the Jews are not the real Jews that were Pretenders to the face that the Jews are behind the slave trade that the Jews are subhuman Vermin that was the ideology that informed this recent attack in Jersey City I don't know if you followed that one that was the one where it was a couple and they were driving or they they wanted to Target police officers in Jews and they target is officers and yes they hated pigs and they hated Jews that's what they do there were diary entries in Google searches and think I mean sounds horrible to say but they I went the next day to Jersey City to see to see the aftermath of it and they had targeted specifically this Kosher grocery store ended up killing icing for people but literally the right above the grocery store to the left at the grocery store and then a synagogue in above the synagogue is a school where there were like Fifty young children thank God they were murdered then they fight comes to light if you don't feel like a week ago that they had a bomb in the U-Haul that had the range of five football fields that they wanted to deploy and everyone was laughing hahaha like look at these crazy people that believe this crazy ideology will this crazy ideology is moving people to do very very violent things and their things and things that haven't even made the news you know like if we believe this idea right that the Brooklyn is the result of communal friction how does that explain my friends father-in-law who's walking on the Upper East Side wearing a yamaka on his head and get the s*** kicked out of him how does that explain my friend from who is a progressive Jew where is a rainbow yarmulke is on the subway and he has he's had several interactions with this group who scream and him hold one of them filled up a picture of Louis Farrakhan saying you're not a real Jew you're a f***** all of you is horrible thing this is like creeping everywhere at a friend on the Lower East Side that was visibly Jewish not wearing a black hat wearing a yarmulke but look like you were me got punched this was like 2 years ago I hate that it's like being Unleashed and that's the thing that's most disturbing like if you look at the Anti-Defamation League statistics only a small purse of hate crimes committed against Jews something like 15% last year were committed by white supremacist they're among the most violent in the most visible but who's the rest of them that's actually more alarming to me the fact that it's like coming from all of these different directions and how do you contain it once it's been Unleashed crimes committed against you something like 15% last year were committed by white supremacist they're among the most violent in the most visible but who's the rest of them that's actually more alarming to me the fact that it's like coming from all of these different directions and how do you contain it once it's been Unleashed</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Redbook what was what was your goal what was when you weigh sat down and decided you're going to write this book how to fight anti-Semitism what what were you thinking the first of all I wrote I supposed to write another book that I'm still on the hook for I went and bagpipe through this because after Pittsburgh I just kind of couldn't stop seeing it everywhere I looked and honestly like yeah I think of Pittsburgh hadn't happened I wouldn't have written this first but I just became so passionate about it so passionate about here so I think maybe the shortest answer for this when we talk about anti-Semitism leaving you and I like we think about Jews the Jews on the streets of Brooklyn or in Pittsburgh or in that synagogue in California as being the victims of it and they are but the real bigger victim of it is the surrounding Society like when anti-Semitism shows itself in a culture it means what culture is extremely broken or in some stage of death and the reason that I think it's so important and the reason I ultimately wrote the book as I want people to understand that the fact that anti-Semitism is rising in America says nothing about Jews it says everything about America and where we are right now like we don't want to be, please where anti-Semitism is normalized because guess what societies were anti-Semitism become normalized societies that no longer exist on the face of the Earth I'd like how you described in your book as a symptom like that we all have certain bacteria will have certain viruses but our immune system keeps them at bay windows viruses show themselves it's a it's a sign that the immune system is weak that the body itself is weak how do we rebuild back our immune system and one of the reasons that I'm alarmed by I completely understand the populist moment but I'm also scared of it because populism often does not end well for juice or for the political Center and I think wanted one of the reasons that we need to like how do we rebuild our immune system like those are the sort of things that I suggest in the last chapter of the book and I think I do I just hope we can do them because I'm really really alarm that we're living in America in 2020 where people I know you know who are Jewish star like put it inside their shirt when they walk down the street that's crazy like that's crazy to me that's normal there you know a lot of juice I know we're taking shooting lessons I just had a guy reach out to me that would like I read your book I read your speeches I think you're great but none of them are going to help you if someone attacks you on the street let me teach you like Krav Maga self-defense going to do it at New York shooting I hate it I had to take I hate like the few times that I've gone Shootin I hate it I really do</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I think one of the things this alarming about our politics right now is like things that were just regarded up until like 5 years ago as the kind of Lunatic Fringe have made their way into mainstream politics Steve Bannon Breitbart as the platform of the alt right and then she been it was sitting down the hall from the president of the United States the alt-right was like young Republicans that were a little different you know I don't know what it is no no no not now for sure but I mean in the perceptions will be all right in the beginning was like what I thought Milo yiannopoulos was when he first burst onto the scene sort of like you know a guy who's like joking about you no sags and kikes you're still saying the thing he's gay and he's Jewish and so the idea was that he could get away with these things provocateur was the word I was looking for this is essentially what he's doing and he's using that to build social currency right that social currencies developing this large group of people that follow him and talk to him and he thinks that there's some Merit to his ideas so he finds some sort of justification for having these provocative conversations in this stance where you saying these things and and a big proponent of free speech and all these things are happening all the same time that's what I thought the alt-right was initially what I thought the alt-right was initially was people that wanted a new younger more more current take on what Republican is and then it became racist and then it became you know all the things that we think of it now in terms of like public perception right now who even says they're alright mean it's almost like such a pejorative like the label has become so toxic I don't misunderstand The Fading of the label for the power of the movement it's just become kind of more normal Republican out alt right ideas have been subsumed by the Trump is Republican party to some extent look like the idea that some Americans are less American than others that is certainly an old right idea that I think it's extremely dangerous when you saw it when he was he was a great example when Trump went after the squad okay as I remember when he said that they should go back to the totally broken crime-infested places that they came from hahaha America one is a naturalized US citizen the idea there right as I heard it and maybe I'm hearing something you're not that some Americans because of their skin color or their ideas sort of have provisional belonging here for me is a very very more than a dog whistle something that is deeply on American and deeply bigoted if he had said that about one person who would come here from somewhere else it was awful and was criticizing America then there would be no more valid and that would be like it euliano Mars not from America initially and I can't stand her ideas which is a naturalized citizen who is sworn to uphold the values of the Constitution that sucks is the response to someone criticizing the way things are here is pretty ridiculous. State citizen you just think that this place should be bad yes then you can just agree with her ideas but that that concept right that you're not entirely of a place that is something that has been used against Jews forever the idea that you're not fully araquey because you're Jewish or you're not fully American because you're Jewish or you're not fully French because you're Jewish like the idea of provisional belonging is something that is that I'm extremely sensitive to toxic tribalism that's attached to the concept the alt-right ideas look at who's Steve Bannon has made common cause with right people like Nigel farage people like Marine Le Pen I mean there was a really good documentary about Steve Bannon where he's meeting with people who really are not just like normal conservative deeply xenophobic politician in France whose father was profoundly anti-semitic she claims that he's that she's not but she's someone that you know you say her name in any Jewish community and National front sounds like Stormfront it's really not a political party since 2011 recent eruption 2017 spin the member of the national doesn't say what she does then say mecro anyway so back to her and I don't know why I see ideas getting expressed like there are there are people that Tucker Carlson has had on his show who are like a valid white nationalist recently can you Google that Jamie there was a guy that he had on the other day or even even Beast whistles right of like there's a way to criticize did you find it sorry people argued against their ideas Rodger Stone Rodger Stone to white nationalist now his links to White nationalism Peter d'abrosca I don't know the Trump is called well a big one things the Republican party has done that's wise if you want to keep a solidified team is that they haven't come out against him and they've supported him and there's very little dissent and this is this is a good idea if you want your team to win right and there was a lot of people who are kind of never trumper's or softener stance once they realize the power of his presidency that he's a real sometimes sometimes trumper's yeah yeah I'm alarmed I'm alarmed by people I'm alarmed whenever there's not worth his outward has an outward lack of compassion and when there is an outward to stain for the other because essentially this country is all the other the whole thing that's all we have is the other man that's that's the whole thing Trump is just beyond the sort of like he said various things that are like you speak speaking to a Jewish group and he talked about your prime minister I mean you said so many things that are ridiculous but the big big thing that he's guilty of is he is like dismantled the guardrails of the keep Society decent and civil and normal and like once you dismantle those things like it's a very easy to reverse not very easy but you can reverse policies with much harder to reverse is a culture and he has just been gleefully making war on what I think of is very very important cultural norms like not attacking the weakest people in our culture like not attacking gold star families like I mean he is attacked he's denigrated like the most heroic and the weakest people that are cultured every possible turn I just kind of went away. That was so I remember that November Wiki people forget this when he said about Judge Alonzo curiel was born in this country that he couldn't give a fair hearing to Trump University because he was born in Mexico American yes Royal Republic and because look at all the great things he's done for Israel if you're loyal Judah Israel you would vote Republican who don't vote for him or just the way I mean like to think about it indiana-born federal judge who President Donald Trump wants it could not be impartial because he was Mexican cleared a major obstacle standing in the way of Trumps long-promised border wall with Mexico ideas despicable reinforces his tribe right and that's one thing that Donald Trump has clearly done is calculated cultivate rather a tribe you know he is a tribe it mean to have a f****** live a hat right they have a slogan and it's a weird slogan because it seemed so positive makeamericagreatagain that seems positive but it's not like if you if you like people punch you if you have that hat on so so crazy we've gotten to a point society that something that's a positive statement like make America great again is so polarizing that people will be violent towards you and feel like they need to feel like they need a lot like you're the enemy</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> when you think about the social media sites gab was one where this guy who shot up the tree of life was a member of and is is this like I'm not a proponent of censorship but do people do think they get radicalized in these when you get to a forum where there's no restrictions whatsoever on language or geology or behavior you can say whatever you want as long as it's long as you're not saying something you ate. I mean gab has rules like you can't do things that are illegal you can't threaten someone you can't put up their address but you could say a lot of really f***** up s*** and they're not going to deny going to police you do you think that these places that do allow free speech that there's a catch-22 to it in some ways it's great to build Express Yourself freely but another way you can get radicalized and they can they can it can lead to a lot of people forming these groups were they support each other in these f*****-up ideas I feel so strongly about keeping the spectrum of acceptable opinion so like as wide as possible is because I think that the narrow where it shrinks like we're talking about normal ideas being closeted then people go into these underground layers online and they become flies right because they're like that the elites are in the mainstream Media or whoever they're not telling the truth or lying to me so there's this secret world and his secret world has all of these actually bigoted ideas dinner and I mean so do I think that it is a catch-22 yeah yes I mean the whole thing about the world we're living in is that you no longer have to like find a KKK meeting you don't have to find a jihadist preacher you don't have to fight you go down the line just have to find a Reddit chat or Fortune chat or something on gab.com and you find your little online Village like it no longer requires a real person or real interaction and there's no Stakes cuz there's no shame because you can just be totally Anonymous in these forums is supercharging this in a way that like we can't even grasp and it's very hard for those of us like me and you want to protect free speech and Liberty to think about how to deal with it how do you deal with that like when you have something like the Christ Church shooter who was live streaming this and making references to know what what did what did PewDiePie as well and murdering at the same time and what is the I mean there's no in my eyes there's no clear solution to that I don't want to restrict free speech I certainly don't want you don't want to cause people to livestream on a platform to go and kill people right when the guys never killed anybody before and then all sudden he's got this camera on any in the synagogue and he starts shooting what how do you how do we manage that mean what what do we do what do we do in that certain there's no in my mind there's no clear answer here there's not a clear answer but I think that looks idea that a private company should be obligated to someone killing someone or let's even go like take it less taste than that called use kikes why should why should a private company say yes to that it's degrading what the platform is that makes sense that makes sense the question is we're does that line get drawn now you know the real problem means there's people that get kicked off of certain social media sites for just not representing whoa culturally for instance Meghan Markle Murphy Megan Murphy that woman who got kicked off of Twitter because she said a man is never a woman and she got kicked off for Life went when the spectrum of what is reasonable becomes so narrow people radicalized and then go to these bigoted ideas and immigration and it's like the conversation about immigration is I think very very limited in what people say and you know what they what would is acceptable like it's like open Borders or xenophobia about it again and again and again also should be possible for us to keep gang members in cartel members from crossing the border freely and shooting people and killing people and selling drugs in our communities and all the things that we were scared of when it comes to the open border policy idea the the thing about the the social-media thing and in a lot of ways it's this new experiment right there's something that we've never had before like if you like you're saying about a KKK meeting you used to have to go to one right and now you don't know you just have to go to Stormfront whatever website you can find that supports your ideas and this is this is a new challenge and it's a new challenge that has really been mapped out nor has it been I don't know if it's been rationally dissected in terms of like if we do this this could happen if we don't do this this could happen which is is a or b better what how do we stop a or at Warby from happening how do we somehow or another educate and improved how do we reach out these people that are going to get radicalized and offer them some sort of a positive Community as as as possible alternative because this is what a lot of this stuff is a lot of people to get radicalized 1 things that happens is you don't have anyone that cares about you or support you but you find people that are very strongly believe in an idea they believe in an idea and awful idea so much so that they're willing to kill people for that idea and then you find a bunch of them and then they reinforce others beliefs totaling with these positive affirmations and essentially their signaling to them their virtue signaling to these horrible people that they also agree with a lot of these ideas and then you go out and you do something you act like the guy in Charlottesville that ran over that girl this these these horrific acts are almost there encouraged and supported by these tight-knit groups of people that all they're all they're all f***** up and f***** up people finder and f***** up people find each other and hurt people hurt people right so they fine this category of people is this group of people whether it's online or whether they actually have to go to a KKK mean and they find support this is a group that somehow another gets them</div>

called the fart principal I have no understanding of how that principle could relate to this but I'm all ears this is why this is a bad example does a bad example but it's not a bad one if you fart and you didn't have a nose no one would know if we didn't have a sense of smell when you have a sense of smell we can still get along in the dimensions are multiple things that we I'm perceived that

living in a concrete her to Courtyard with offense defense was open just outside the fences Tibetan Mastiff chained up and he said that this bad wasn't fazed about me to buy most of it was straight past it into the courtyard with scratching is still do whilst he was hiding in one of these empty covers Fox man there monsters in a real thing grizzly bears and brown bears weren't real and then there were in a movie you'd be like what in the world if you know they're there would you going to want to walk for that long yet their country where is your heart and my heart is a I get to I get to be black for a summer in my mind so there's something in it for me the other thing is I get to hold up to Nature the insane self-involved hypocrisy of artists and what they think they're allowed to do on occasion just my opinion and also been who is a masterful artist and director probably the closest thing to a Charlie Chaplin that I've you might have the time he writes he directs he acts he if you would seen him when he was directing this movie you would have been like I'm watching David Lee and I'm watching Chaplin I'm watching Coppola he he knew exactly what the vision for this was he executed it it was impossible to not have it be an offencive nightmare of a movie and 90% of my black friends are like do that's great you know I can't disagree with them but I know where my heart was and I think that it's never an excuse to do something that is out of place and not if it's time but to me it was just putting a it was a blasting cap on and by the way I think White Chicks came out pretty soon after that as I got love that I like that was great can we see that unless things change it seems like no one can really I don't think you could do breakfast anymore I mean we almost lost the prime minister of Canada cuz he did brownface he had pretended to be Saudi Arabian Arabian Nights in high school or something like that it's it's an interesting and necessary meditation on where is the pendulum why is the pendulum right where is the pendulum a little into what could be perceived as as heart in the right place openness of its time but again I mean you know there's a morality Clause here on this planet and it's a big price to pay and I think having a moral psychology is his job one so sometimes you just got to go yeah you know I act up again not in my defense but tropical there was about how wrong that is so I take exception it was turd the media and the DNC got together and they're like hey let's do this cuz of coordinated doesn't come out of nowhere what what they're doing is they're making themselves less and less relevant and they're making guys like you and independent more and more relevant and more and more trustworthy and that's why they keep going to the catnip of Russia gate or wheat or whatever impeachment called to the thing is that a guy has an $83,000 job on a board in a country his dad just helped overthrow the f****** crazy get the billion-dollar right what do you know they fired the guy and that guy did say later that guy who got fired today I got fired because I was investigating originally said that in a court document so believe me why didn't they why didn't they impeach Trump on the emoluments Clause why didn't they do that why did they do it on this position in government it's the best so many people are saying that people are saying what's wrong with the woman using her degree she has three degrees I wonder how she was at 4 able to afford those three degrees I wonder if he overcame all those obstacles did she die Annabelle Street Banks that's not me saying that that's Dylan ratigan award-winning Bloomberg reporter says that how they pay him off well he has a I don't know if you noticed he just bought a house and Martha's Vineyard from the guy who owns the Celtic but he's healthy as a 40 has 49 Acres got a lot of money than Kevin Hart I mean there's some people I thought were never Bill Cosby I'm going to say so it was on that list I never liked him I didn't know it was one of those things where if you would said any of this that you're saying 10 years ago people have been furious at you well somebody told me he was a creep back in 1983 and 94 and as a person that makes sense I had heard from people on the set of news radio that he drugged girls it was like one of those weird things you heard as a room like why does he do drunk girls like Bill Cosby man that's obviously a sick kinky head but I also know a guy with a promoter and and told incredibly ridiculous stories about things that Bill Cosby did that were not sexual but just informed me that what his Kink is is part of a much larger sickness about control and making people do weird things because he can let me tell you what I heard when you tell me what you heard I heard you make people watch him eat Curry shoes make the whole staff come into his dresser and watch him eat I hadn't heard that exactly but it's exactly in line with what I heard that he would do things like make you what was one of them like you would order food and then he would say you know scoop out the the do we part of the hamburger bun after you wash your hands and put it back on the hamburger or once he asked them to send him the soap that he hadn't finished using in the dressing room like kolenda to him send it to crazy crazy s*** they like it that like something different there their tired of these people that sound like politicians you know you hear a person Elizabeth Warren hear them talk and you feel the bull coming out of their mouth while they're talking you know that they're playing a role you know the deal with Trump he might be arrogant he might be crazy he might be ridiculous but that's him that's that guy I bet if you'd be around him all day long he's like that and that's that's the thing that one of the things that people like about him he's like that all the time but that's who he is but he's not but he doesn't need the b******* he's Donald Trump he's a f****** multi-billionaire who is now the president of the United States so it's like he doesn't feel the need to put on an act for anybody so when he comes out and says he died like a dog like that's that's how he would talk yeah I know I think the consistency I think you're right there is there's an element of like I'm tired I'm tired of the b******* I'm going to see what you're saying but I guess what I think Dennis and what are the chances that you get to 21 Warren 2020 look at that but we get down in November the election and people just exhausted by it so they wanted something different now they've had it are they going to get to this point November and get ready to vote I can't take another four years of it even though it's entertaining I'm exhausted people don't like change they get scared of change and if things are going well economically and if you know if it turns out that this thing with Iran doesn't turn into anything disastrous by the time November rolls around I think is going to win in a landslide I really I don't CMS Bernie Sanders and Tulsi gabbard get together and then everybody goes you know what that would work like this is a this is a real combination of people that I could I could give on something like that where there's like some overwhelming can lie but I don't see that then they seem to be pushing for Elizabeth Warren I don't see that she was a republican most of her career and then she became a Democrat like when she was in her late forties and maybe it's just me but the but I don't see policy message that I don't see that happening 444 her this go around maybe maybe it'll change maybe you need I don't know but problem is I feel like these people just want to be president I feel like it's a self-aggrandizement thing they just want to be president I did you get all your dad about anybody in politics or that person started out by being head of the Republican or Democratic Club in high school and that's all I want to do the nearest State Senator and then text now who started out by being head of the Republican or Democratic Club in high school and that's all I want to do the nearest State Senator and then I'm going to run for Congress</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> the way I was fat my one of my boys was home sick the other day from school the middle boy Sluggo and so we're sitting on the sofa and said you know like we were sheep and we've bought the Disney plus hanging and Peter Pan the original Peter Pan ride the original Disney Peter Pan so we started. And I'd forgotten what that movie was like in terms of its treatment of Native Americans what the hell anyway I'm sitting there and even Sluggo looks at me kind of racist turn on tape called Black Elk speaks it's about this Oglala Sioux medicine man who was while he was still alive and then the 1930s they they wrote this book we'd be told the story of Custer and he was there he was a young boy when Custer was killed and he told the story of like life on the Plains and Crazy Horse and it's f****** fascinating what was it written threat in 1930s daily mail letter in Scouts with Kelly speaks listen to on this is like the 4th or 5th one that I've listened to a Native Americans over the last couple of months but this is the best one this is the best one because not that the other ones weren't great they were great but what's interesting about this is the actual words of a man who lived that life it's not just a historical book about the time and describe the events that I'm this is a guy describing what he saw and he was talking particular about war about the way it was when you know they killed Custer and he was there when they killed Custer and just the battles between the American soldiers and the Native Americans like it's crazy it's crazy to think that it happened just a short time ago and it's also crazy to think that if no one came to America like if the world just stayed in Europe in Asia and in the way it had been before Columbus and before the Pilgrims and all that s*** these people would probably still be living like that cuz that's not that long ago well as image think about it to what was the warring tribal cultures it's a difficult environment right and which to say okay we're going to have some sort of federal system we're going to come together we're going to the greater good and you know I know but I've ever seen Native American Indian reservations in this country and I don't never been oh my God never been other than casinos it's just you going and I spent most of my adult life overseas and first time I was on a reservation here in the US we be here but it's you know history repeats that's not a good follow-up either I mean right we haven't we just been to this day we don't do a very good job at all and the reservation system not not all I've ever seen on Indian reservations and good God of their tribe somebody to come in here and talk to me about it because I just had to sort of a peripheral understanding of it up until about five or six months ago I really you know I I had seen movies and I had read books and I'd kinda understood but I doubt he didn't really really get into it until I started reading these books and it's just it's just incredible to think that there was millions and millions of tribes are millions and millions of members of different tribes living in this country like basically like Stone Age people 150 years ago and often times so you know in in constant conflict with each other and the Comanches six arrows in 10 seconds do they were just like these f****** soldiers up cuz they couldn't reload right but I'd wait for the initial Valley and then they charge in and they also could they were such great Horseman they could actually shoot underneath the horse's neck so that hold onto the rain somehow or they were under the horse's neck and they were protected and they were shooting at the soldiers near and they were shooting from horses nobody knew how to do that before everybody got off the horse to shoot and they were going to encounter a ride please cover and concealment of the Comanches apparently dominated if they had so many horses they were rich and horses they're the ones that figured out how to master the horse the best gel to use small horses they didn't use like these big horses at the Americans use right but small people small people a book with stray into sort of okay well let's look you know from the perspective of another whichever tribe they were in battle with but not using very good so I'll pick up this book is it is it is it's an amazing history and you're right it's not that long ago there's another great book was quite a few of them with blood and thunder today nothing right they run out and was a small guy wasn't allowed a soft voice and yeah there was a show men who made America think or it was a follow-on from that but they they had a handful of episodes about Kit Carson but they kind of went through they picked out some of that the individuals you would imagine right I mean the frontier I think the men who built the frontier I think it would cause a follow-on to that Siri said they did but The Men Who Built America okay which seems misogynistic but women probably helped they had an hour behind every great Titan of Industry there was a woman and several of his Mistresses but I think that this this thing about building the Frontiers was interesting they tried they tried to provide a perspective from the Native American Indians point of view I don't think I did a good job The Covered Bridge was still worth watching so was it was a good series yeah I think most of us are pretty ignorant to what goes on on the reservations today and I'm included you know you hear these horrible stories of alcoholism and poverty and you know just that they live in these nations inside of a Nation that's what it's what's very strange and the only thing that really knows natural resources that can help them but really gambling gambling becomes a big Revenue source for Allah Lenape tribe simply apply for it Cayman license around very good it will say this much in terms of just the way they laid the museum out right but it's it's just absolutely full to the ceiling of incredible stories and artifacts and and history bits but it's definitely worth people going to DC if they if they sent him to go to Smithsonian station put that one on the list because it's it's really fascinating in terms of just the way they laid the museum out right but it's it's just absolutely full to the ceiling of incredible stories and artifacts and and history bits but it's definitely worth people going to DC if they if there's enough time to go to Smithsonian since you put that one on the list because it's it's really fascinating</div>

You're not even a little suspicious I don't think this guy might be a creep what's your favorite movie Alien Space jonra movie the best one is alien the Sigourney Weaver movie I think first one yeah that's most likely would alien life is going to be like some horrific parasitic f****** creature that eats everything it finds yeah that's that's amazing is likely that seems more likely I remember sitting the theater when that movie came out watching it in when that when it popped out of that guy's chest he was in the entire theater jobs just crazy but I know it's hard because you watched that movie today and you're watching it having seen all the other movies that it's affected and all the other science fiction genre movies and special effects movies but that movie was special in 1979 when that movie came out that was a special movie that was a f****** horrifically scary movie and it was no cut the s*** scenes everything seemed legitimate the creature was completely unique Weaver was hot hot as f*** I mean a woman is the hero and you not you not flinching you're not there's no part where you're going to want what is she doing she's kicking everybody's ass to the f*** out of here that's that's a movie like that's a real hero that's a real hero who Rises to the occasion in this horrific situation where this ship has it been overtaken by an alien I think that there's I think that there's things out there I don't know if I believe I want to believe that we've been visited but I don't know if I believe I think it's things out there I'm on board with the second part of that as well you know it's hard to find out from the network when they're going to start this show and this getting Secrets out of Washington DC right so I'm thinking we would have known for now if it had happened but I I do believe this other s*** out there right I just I can't believe we're at I don't think we're it do that there's something that something was here that they would visit occasionally dropping out of the cage land for a scientific expedition to see what the f*** were up to if you wanted a person if you weren't a person if you were for some from some enlightened race a million years Advance our house you would be so fast and to come by and look at people that was alive back then God damn it would be faster to be a fly on the wall and watch these primitive humanoids try to figure out fire and try to figure out hunting and and become what we are today and watch the whole thing because I think I would be boring as s*** I mean that rock into a circle do something with it come on traveling in at these distances in the week again looking at the issues of propulsion systems for Hypersonic flight except with a look at this bunch of you know folks down here and think just not interested I don't know I think it is certain point in time it would be unnecessary to physically visit I feel like maybe watching us to the Samsung TV you know folks down here and think it's just not interested I don't know I think at a certain point in time it would be unnecessary to physically visit I feel like maybe watching us through the Samsung TVs</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you think about all this stuff about I mean New York New York Times at articles about at this Air Force test pilot Santa come out talking about encountering flying saucers or unidentified flying object particularly Commander fravor right head that David navigation program and I always say the same thing about everything but after talking to some of these folks including forever and a handful of others who were both pilots and also involved in in the a tip program for the u.s. government to the military there's there's things out there that we haven't been able to identify and I'm not jumping on on the I'm not jumping on the alien train 9sa but I'm what I'm saying is that there's things that extremely experienced Pilots military Pilots with significant amounts of experience couldn't figure out couldn't identify and so I'm certainly not to be smart enough to say okay this is what it was was it a foreign governments experimental aircraft was it something I don't know but what I do know is that the u.s. government took it seriously enough that they developed their own internal program within the Pentagon to try to sort out the wheat from the chaff right and save okay what do we actually have to worry about in part because it's national security issue right if there is a aircraft or if there's something up there that a pilot a military pilot sees for instance that government should be working on that the problem is always been that once you talk about that then people me to go off area51 gets dismissed but there was a much more serious effort than I I knew about before I started working on this thing and so I don't know I think I've got an open mind about that it's it's like that old thing about how can we really be the only people out here are or life-forms out here that seems a little obscure for me to believe it seems unrealistic yeah X out and tells the story and he's not deviating from the story he's not a guy was trying to make money and it's just an idiot doesn't have a history of telling fantastic stories was actively jamming the radar which I said what the f*** and then that's the way it moved from 60,000 feet down below 200 ft and like less than a second and no signs of a nose no signs of any propulsion system ya think about that one way or the other you know that the point of this is to agganis account use the money Trail as a way to get inside some of these programs and then to the degree that you can without you know to agree that you can't talk about things are Declassified you know not necessary try to make a case we're not trying to say it is this or does that you know but I think we're presenting a lot of interesting information that you know about this situation with favor as an example. I was pretty much straight forward you know pound the ground through some counter-insurgency operations counter-narcotics counterterrorism operations we never did encounter alien things and we were being contacted on the regular basis or at least a semi-regular basis that would change the way everybody feels about everything yes ma'am Andre gave that speech me made me give it I think was United Nations you said to imagine how easily we would come together if we are faced with a threat from an alien world right and everybody was like oh my God he knows something what that would mean not just obviously bromygod really there's something going on out there but then swear that break down and entrust not that it's not happening already in terms of the government and its ability to play square but has an experimental test site for aircraft and you know it made perfect sense well then you get all these experimental aircraft and yeah locals you know see this s*** you know local thing I'm fairly good-sized region because of the the the distance on these and you know it's understandable how you start getting some of these stories but you know having having said that you know I sat down with Private Ryan we talked about this a lot for this one episode and I talked to several others and not sure what to think but again I'm not closing the book on anything at this point see the way I look at it as if these were unique Expeditions from another planet like or whatever it is that comes here some alien spacecraft the all they have to do is come here once or twice get set up a show science expeditions to Tijuana I'm not going back there no way unless I'm drunk again they could just do it a couple of times and people have these stories and everybody else dismisses it like where are they worthy I don't see any aliens cuz you really wouldn't and yet you probably are capable of moving at the speed of flavor described where it was just impossible to track with a human not like they're not going to be no I don't want to steal their technology all the weird what ifs and who could do this and how could that be true the Delian one is the most fascinating cuz if that was real and if we somehow or another one day get some undeniable proof like the the favor film the film footage the Gunner footage to the the radar for the that's pretty goddamn compelling but man if there was something like that CDL in one is the most fascinating cuz if that was real and if we we somehow or another one day get some undeniable proof like the the favor film the film footage the Gunner footage did the radar for the that's pretty goddamn compelling but man if it was something like that off the charts</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> how about the other thing you got to go to about the other prince the one that's Epstein's friend no answer Luke 18 she looks 16 are you sure you should let me let me ask you this found out that the the tapes were missing at the f****** the cameras didn't work in the tapes were deleted from the first accidentally deleted from the first time you attempted suicide and schirmer's like a conspiracy evidence that will the biggest get a professional and yeah it's it's it's astounding but but yeah what what is it your birthday and I'm nobody can get to the bottom of anything but it has a crazy one like they got him in the jail the guards are somehow or another getting in trouble so who knows what the guards are going to say they might get suicided my favorite part was the guy they chose for his cellmate to see the f****** gorilla they chose for sale media reminded me of that Richard Pryor That giant Goomba is huge Italian ex-cop who was a murderer and a drug Runner I mean this guy is built like a brick shithouse and this is Epstein cellmate up giant likes to also keep them from all the people that he killed they bark when they're coming around and grab your gun it's a good move its it's just crazy there's so many pieces to the puzzle that are so ridiculously obvious and then when you find out that Clinton flew them at least 26 x 26 x had no idea thanks again I don't I'm I'm not a buyer on these sort of things but yeah you look at it you look at the facts around you think they just know there's no way in hell went home again me and it seems like they dead set something up for him to make it very easy for him to be incarcerated for what should be a pretty heinous crime I mean he would think sex with underage girls and sex trafficking death without saline or just laying okono in Columbia or something all the Clinton tapes compiling out onto the f****** floor of Wednesday Gladys Bell agents who've been murdered that's literally what she was reading a book on what he was was compromising a lot of these wealthy powerful people but getting video tapes of them hooking up with young girls including prince Andrew right now and for whatever reason you know you heard of anything like this before it's just something that's been done in the past not not hurt the first time time names I mean it went so well and I'm going to tell you something after the show's over after shows it but if you whisper in my ear Hilaria never figure that out that's understand Korean push that right on the front porch to get back we can you talk about North Korea but a common strategy that intelligence agencies would use where they would try to compromise people in order to get like what would be the benefit if you had like the Mossad was doing that and they were doing that too and using the theories and people believe it's because I'm saying it doesn't do that we don't use honey traps we don't do that sort of thing because that sort of Leverage always is it's always going to head south on you and so we don't you know try to call or somebody in that sort of a relationship and then we can take advantage of and yet other services do the Russians being one of them they do that all the time yeah they've they've had some very successful efforts to do that end and if you can if you get somebody in that position they're compromising himself with you put themselves in with it was like an Epstein situation where suddenly you got them at video of them with with an underage person or whether they provided a document that they shouldn't buy it's always the concept is always the same no matter what that what that action is your you're getting them on the hook your your you getting something that's leverageable over them and if if they don't just go forward and mediately saying Turn Around of the boss and say I'm guilty did this sorry then they're compromised and then you've got them as mental service you've got that we can start again because now you know you know that not only did they do something to do with that. overseas or whatever and I'm thinking all right I'm trying to explain this person's got to access there an interesting position nursing job and then they got access information that we want to know this priority Target and then I want to say okay now I want to develop a relationship a little bit maybe I'll bump into the person of the few parties maybe we're in the same parent-teacher organization whatever this year that's right can you work the foreign ministry here and you know whatever country haven't been how about you give me some documents but instead you know maybe it's something different maybe they worked for mystery maybe they work in Aerospace business you know that's a Target and you say it but you've developed a bit of a relationship with my kids doing this school project and you know it's all about whatever Hypersonic flight you know and and you know you know that they work at some you know aerospace companies hypersonics you know and and you're not looking for anything classified you just looking for a research paper or study or something and on and if they come back and say this is an interesting study that act alone and I given you some classify but that act alone mean something big right it means their work askable in a sense they responded to your request for information you can put it that way but you go from there then you ratchet it up slowly bit by bit if you got the time frame to do it maybe sometimes you know you got too short a time frame because there's a requirement to get along and you got to accelerate the whole process of getting leverage on all these different people for whatever his purpose was he went with a lot of celebrities there was a state money I mean maybe he'd maybe you just who knows maybe you got off on sort of being the Kingpin in this whole thing and I had to be something valuable that they were getting from it I'm guessing I don't know get the idea of you would have leverage over these people you have been compromising situations and then they would do things for you but what would they do for you yeah like what I like being close to you know the seat of power or maybe you don't like being close to what he thought was like the royal family member it is interesting but I don't think I mean look at it since I've been kicked to the curb Abba to do in the trolley is to some degree but I don't think I don't know what the weather is going to have the new cycle is so fast when something happens even something as ridiculous as the Epson case with so obviously he was murdered and then Michael bad and goes on 60 Minutes and says consistent with when was strangled up never in all my years of seeing people hang them never seen him with these kind of fractures this is fractures or indicative of strangulation it has one serious money to do to write it's something we should explore I want to see what he's probably got a fur-lined cell.

		<div class="paragraph"> tape over that camera you do this probably you do write how much you know if you got one that's over recent vintage check and you'll see there's a little little hole that's like trying to program your your VCR I trying to figure out how to get into your TV into the settings to change the smart interactivity and then do you also want to trust that that's what's going to happen if you turn it off so but they also don't have the resources and time available commercial side of things I was different because it drives what they're all about which is making money especially when you sign those terms of agreements the terms of use agreements like most people just accept it you don't look through it I was decades ago but you you give up that right by clicking on agree on those user agreement allows anyone to access and obtain copies of the date of The Company Store on them and the right to delete that data and opt out of company selling or monetizing their data only for residents California though they live somewhere else but you can now then then anything even in a lot of ways more than the government spying on us about the power that something like Facebook has the insane amount of influence they have on people and how do they use of their algorithms they actually instigate arguments and try to get people because that's how people respond and that's what makes people want to click on things and I that's what generates Revenue so their algorithms encourage you know what an outrage but they don't really but people like outrage so they encourage you to go seek out like Ari shaffir didn't expiry will use YouTube and you only search for puppies that's always search for just puppies on YouTube and that's all you two would recognize this is all they were recommending to him was puppies and he's like okay so it's really not nefarious based entirely on what your needs are or what what your interests are butts so many people are interested in things that outraged them that it becomes a very profitable thing for them when their algorithm shows these people what they want but it's the problem is the people itself it's not surely the album it's not like some the algorithm in some nefarious algorithm is designed to instigate The Strife now it's it's taking advantage of human nature to some degree but it's also raised a really important point because coming up on this election people talk about oh my God they're going to hack in they're going to influence the phone and it's very clever so if you look at like a recent something that just happened was really interesting and being investigated but I report came out from a group area one which is looking at that hackers and looking at cyber security issues and then it's not a well-known group it's not like it's out there but they just came out with a report of a Russian entity likely the former Gru the military intelligence of of the Russian intelligence service hacked into burisma number risma is that company in the Ukraine that Hunter Biden was sat on the board of and now you think and so what happened almost immediately when this report comes out saying recently Ukrainian aw if you don't investigate the bind situation so you'd look at this and if you just looked at it on a very simple level you go wow and I've already seen some of that narrative saying what look the Russians are working on behalf of trump again see that's what they're doing they're working on behalf of their hacking into Purisima and that's you know what he was complaining about if you step back and you think about what are the Russians trying to do right with all of their hacking efforts all their social media engineering they're trying play the scent so now what if you got now you're ramping up the story again now you know to what degree are area one story of report is correct and then there's some discussion as to whether it's accurate or not but to it to that degree that you have to look at everything now with a very skeptical I have to say Okay what is the purpose of it why is this a timed leak of information right today intended another word for the Russian and tell service you don't do anything haphazardly the idea that we're going to wait this out now because now it looks like we're still you know we're pushing this whole thing was trying to help Trump when I get that narrative going again because now we're getting into an election cycle is interesting stuff it's like it's like after we smoked almost immediately after social media post Pro very suddenly but again and over the course of the next 48 hours massive numbers compared to what had been in the past of sympathetic enough to turn people's thoughts right to get that narrative going to be like oh my God they fascinated a foreign leader that's all they're looking to do is create an Iranian cyber security forces is increasingly sophisticated we look at 3:10 to look at this political Spectrum saying I'm right and left whatever but you have to step back and think you know what it what what's what are they doing what's with the purpose of this and maybe it's more complex layer than just simply accepting what it is it's being said which happens you know that side of danger social media it's whether it's for the left or right doesn't matter whether it's from a foreign entity you know that state-sponsored effort you taking your run with it next thing you know it's got 10,000 likes and people are talking about it like it's correct a real problem with today's social media is that these agencies like the internet research agency in Russia did before the 2016 election they really can stir up the scent with these thousands and thousands of social media accounts that they have and they can get people thinking in a certain way then get people to argue things in a certain way and you hear those talking points that these bots in these you know these companies that are designed just to stir people up you see those talking points repeated so it is a fact I'll know absolutely they wanted to get the narrative out there for right so they would pay off during this weather was overseas or here where it may be too in that was old school right but the point of it all right that the the reasoning mind is still the same. You're trying to effect a narrative you're trying to affect a certain opinion or you're trying to foment the scent you're trying to create some chaos and you're right out here now with a lot of the social media that foreign entities of doing they're trying to take advantage and trying to drive wedges at 350 crate why doesn't example whatever it is that they can do and sometimes sometimes I don't it just simply to create the chaos and sometimes it doing it for you no more specific Focus reason but we're not sophisticated and I think we're more aware of it now because it's been in the news and we've been talking about it some degree but as a population were not very sophisticated and so they're still going to take advantage of it and it's not just a rush and it's additive any any nation that resource of the ability and somewhat motivation and sees it in their own best interest they have a cyber unit it's doing this sort of thing so you know where it's going to go but you know you worry about sore the the impact that has it's not the you know it's not the idea that they're going in there to voting machines and switching up data I mean frankly we should be going to a paper-based system I would out if I was in charge I would say that's it no more paperless voting system get that s*** out of here when I can rely on the internet know what they're doing in Iowa for the caucuses so I'm going to be a internet-based voting reporting for the caucuses in Iowa get back to the old days here if you're targeting a terrorist organization and you start having success picking up cam to Communications and Indian gathering signals Intelligence on the first thing they do is throw their phones away and go back to the old system of work I'm going to hand write some message I'm going to hand it to my cousin he's going to hand it to his cousin and that's all that's our communication system from now on so we should dumb down and go back to the old days and just do a paper system you know which takes longer and is a pain in the ass but message I'm going to hand it to my cousin he's going to hand it to his cousin and that's all that's our communication system from now on so we should dumb down and go back to the old Days Inn to do a paper system you know which takes longer and is a pain in the ass but</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> and weird gig and the worst New Year's Eve you got to do something as you send them off that's only an hour and a half left in the New Year in the old year and I feel like that was the appropriate song because it was a song written by a comedian Charlie Chaplin 200 years old was a hit in the 50s for Nat King Cole Michael Jackson we did it in the 90s when he was on trial for child molestation chose to do a song by Charlie Chaplin the Amo famous job they didn't call it that but yes he married no anyting he married like it was like Jerry Lee Lewis he was like with 14 year olds Charlie Chaplin can you run your magic lightbox Jamie and see if see if there's a no child molester yes Charlie Chaplin famous for it for that and I hope you know back then I don't think they got your for it but what do you think 20 I don't know if they were child labor laws I just don't know what Priscilla Presley when she like 14 when I wrecked yeah and that was Elvis was a child molester too and that was the 50s right right and that while he went into the army in 58 so that's when he met her in Germany her father was a colonel and she was 14 and of course he was 25 and a giant Rockstar and he says to the colonel would you mind if I took 14 year old daughter back to America she can live with me at Graceland and it'll all be good in the guy says enjoy what the f*** was wrong with people back to not is there a chapel in The Hangover or child molester yes I definitely is rougher you know I mean you and I I think walk the same path we often talkin about we I think of progressives but we have short patience with some of the fragile some of that is just the way you're brought up I think kids are coddled you know I think they're indulged and that's the reason why they freak out over microaggressions and stuff and some of that is just as telling some of the stories not a apropos of this just talk about something else but it just reminded me that here I'm a kid who had I think a normal middle-class upbringing I consider it an idyllic I consider it an innocent you couldn't buy today I mean first of our group in New Jersey in the 60s there was no racial issues because there was only one race in town that's just the way it was I'm not saying that's good it wasn't but that's so there weren't racial issues that weren't drug issues I didn't I didn't try pot in high school that may have maybe there was a rumor that if you kids were but that wasn't even a thing there wasn't even any like divorce it was really the land That Time Forgot you know it was Leave it to Beaver land and telling someone this time my father who grew up in the depression cheap you know love him dearly but I don't think that's the wrong word and sent this to an army friend of his as the dentist and this is 1964 I was eight did not use novocaine and I remember vividly like he had like eight cavities that had to be filled he said if it hurts raise your hand drill when it's so into me and then I'm riding home up this big hella it was cold on my bike with the tears freezing on my cheek so get to the dentist yourself personally wouldn't do that today just be on their own like get your ass to the dentist on your bike get home after they drill into you with no novacaine by bad people people were just rougher rougher time and I wouldn't recommend these things exactly necessarily although getting some place on your own I don't think it's the worst thing in the world but a little more of that example about that and he believes that you should let your kids roam around and let them find their way home and there is a movement for that that's how I was raised from school flying to the house change into my play clothes fly out the door my mother never said where you going what are you doing and you know we're gone and again in Leave it to Beaver town there was a 6 whistle really yeah different everything I know the whistle went off time for dinner and then you right and then you got your ass home when you heard the whistle we didn't have watches or phones or you know I don't want I mean I don't want to compare it's a different world for sure between the way we grew up in the way they're growing up today I don't know what's better when you heard the whistle we didn't have watches or phones or you know I don't want I mean I don't want to compare it's a different world for sure between the way we grew up in the way they're growing up today I don't know what's better</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> any of those old schoolers that's a point at the front of it sits in true story right talk about how those guys who are such icons couldn't make it today take too long and you could take you could take 2 minutes before you got to the punchline you could take 2 minutes to set something up the audience was perfectly okay with that you could never do that to the Jack Benny and Bob Hope was more rapid fire a lot of these old schoolers you know I mean I have never funny list and at a friend of mine created years ago and some of them are on it you know Danny Thomas and I don't know I mean there's some people I thought were never Bill Cosby stuffy did but everything I've ever heard even as a kid and I saw him on TV I'm like no I don't like this s***'s corny I have I feel very very ahead of my time I never liked him for ya so I know somebody I like Snot somebody I was romantically involved with but a girl who he was horrible to and I never liked him after that as a person that makes sense cuz I just heard from people on the set of Newsradio that he drugged girls it was like one of those weird things you heard as a room like why does he do drug girls but Bill Cosby no I mean American Dad America and you have to wonder why a guy who could get laid as a married man that's obviously a pinky had but I also know a guy who was a promoter and and told incredibly ridiculous stories about things that Bill Cosby did that we're not sexual but just informed me that what his Kink is is part of a much larger sickness about control and making people do weird things because he can let me tell you what I heard and then you tell me what you heard I heard he makes people watch him eat Curry make the whole staff come into his dresser and watch him eat I hadn't heard that exactly but it's exactly in line with what I heard that he would do things like make you what was one of them like you food and then he would say you know scoop out the the do we part of the hamburger bun after you wash your hands and put it back on the hamburger or once he asked them to send him the soap that he hadn't finished using in the dressing room like kolenda to him send it to crazy crazyshit that again speaks to a pathology that's larger than what we know about him sexually that that has a subcategory under that big has to need to have the woman be unconscious that's it that's a weird thing I can't I can't I can't get into certain things I'd like I can't even imagine why someone would find it attractive to be with a child I can understand why that would be appealing to you I can understand this you know a lot of things I can understand to the casino and he made the security guard talked him into bed if you have anything at the lights on so I was like I'm going to lie on the bed I had a friend who had an interesting take on it and he said there is something that happens to some famous people's but particularly famous people who were famous a long time ago where they feel like they are better than other people that there is a giant gap between them and other people they feel like they can do things to people and they that what yeah that's uncommon but his pathology people try to hide that it's called acting house that's why when they're in front of the camera they're so Charming but we know that behind the scenes they're they're not but he seemed to wear it on his sleeve for using bad words but there are people that they get to dispose where they think that they're owed things and he thought about that sexually to he said he probably felt like he was just so above those women and he didn't even want to negotiate with them we just drugged them and f***** him cuz he's Bill Cosby they should be happy it's mostly unexplored a giant mystery human beings I've ever experienced what is experience he's been famous since the 1950s American Icon right is Rich Piana men's groundbreaker end of legitimate world-class stand-up comic who toured the whole world create against Cosby Show that was a groundbreaking television oh yeah so many factors so many factors and then on top of that a psychotic pervert and a creep and drugging women I mean on top and who knows what else just a my fine like 30 dead cats in his backyard me who knows the Five Guys into somebody told me it just may not be true that he was drugging people with animal tranquilizers that that's he had a vet's license or something and that's how it that's how he was two people were like how did he get the stuff that he was using for The Knockout pills vitamin K if I don't feel good I got my feet up here all the time you got some low for now I want to go to your choice you wore those today I didn't even think about it that show was at went out when I started to do it there was such a proliferation of comics that you could do that show 30 times and that didn't make me famous I mean elevated me to a degree it legitimized you and Joe business but that did at one point just doing The Tonight Show once made you a star but part of what true story is about was the comics frustration that they came along at a time when it was did at one point just doing The Tonight Show once made you a star but part of what true story is about was the comics frustration that they came along at a time when it wasn't that unique a thing anymore it was too many Comics you couldn't swing a

		<div class="paragraph"> yeah I would watch something like that accept it is just too much the first was just too much do any dance to watch I mean I put it on my list but you know that and this everything have to be like a season does everything have to be so drugged back to our subject everything is either very condensed or way too drawn out and you have to follow it and you're not like an episode of Friends we don't have to know what the fuk happened the week before and you just tune in to psi yes I depend upon the week before right it was all everything is on dark and I've had 10 people binge I don't binge I never been to anything I have the opposite problem I have watching a d d i when I I love to watch TV it's the last thing I do before I sleep at night but unless something is absolutely compelling I don't watch more than 15 minutes of it I like 15 minutes of this and then 50 minutes of that and 15 minutes and then go to sleep or structuring and Netflix specials that way because of that people are doing their closing bit first I read that somewhere that you have to get to grab them every f****** drama is something and then six months earlier you know we have to go back really crazy do something linear well it's this whole thing that you were saying before we do have a second 7-second attention span or we have 3 hours I would love to see someone try to make a movie like Steve McQueen's LeMans cuz if you don't remember that movie old Steve McQueen before the very talented director heat direct what you know right you're really hate directed he's an African-American eat directed 12 Years of Slave I believe are you are you using your magic lightbox to Google her and he's a big guy that Steve McQueen who died of cancer in 1980 I believe I remember him chasing cures and Mexico for wedding yeah I think you probably was a heavy smoker and there's no talking for like the first I don't know how many minutes is just you know people going there life on the racetrack like all preparing for things and there's no chat Hitchcock movie I mean it just shows how different the audiences are in how we developed or undeveloped or if it's that there's an expectation that people have a short attention span so that everything is made for that expectation know they do I think they I think they really do I mean the more you I do I must say as someone who grew up when Alfred Hitchcock was still was he still making yeah he made a movie in 1972 I was 16 I saw it in the theater was one of his last he was on his last legs but psycho it was 1960 I was too young to for that but he was still very involved in the big director and I tried to watch I did watch the one he made in 1956 the year I was born called The Man Who Knew Too Much I think story he made three times he liked that story about the innocent guy who's being chased by somebody and he doesn't know why they're chasing him and the police are after him but he's got to find the bad guys before the police find him it's Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day it is I mean they talked about at the master of suspense I mean Jesus Christ is like the master of keeping me falling asleep it's really subtle slow I'm sorry but I think they've improved on that I did maybe that's sacrilege to the movie community and Martin Scorsese a write me a letter or something but Jesus Christ I'd much rather watch salt you know there's a thriller that Jason Bourne movies I feel like they took what Hitchcock was doing and yes they wrapped it up and I'm glad they did Hitchcock's hard to get through we also have to realize when Hitchcock was making films they've been only making films for 50 years is a real even though he started in the late 30s Wayback yeah there's something about that like you know anything about stand-up like if you ever tried listen to Lenny Bruce I certainly have good example yeah I can't do it doesn't work anymore we're in a different world</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I've been a fan of yours for a long time I bought true store and I of you what how about that book way back in the day man if I was living in New York was great book thank you I very underrated book on Stanley, early life I would never write another novel just did to make every sentence every paragraph funny or telling no extra words to me that's the kind of that and I would get busy and put it aside and I'll look at it for years and then I did my old life 1985 in December I went down to Zihuatanejo Mexico to do the memorable TV movie TV movie there there's a praise that they chipped memoral TV movie Club Med I think we all remember it now we don't Linda Hamilton was the star I think I do remember it I hope you don't I remember Linda Hamilton in a movie review it was a TV movie and we stayed at the Club Med I was in you know it was kind of a low-budget thing as far as the people in the cast and crew went because we stayed at the Club Med which was not a club that is not a luxury hotel you know what club meds are you give up your money you pay everything and Beads but you don't really need money and the rule is for people who just enjoy the outside that's why you're in Mexico so the room is monastic right there's no TV cuz you're out all day you know you just going to be in the waves and then you're going to f*** and go to sleep and whatever so I had a lot of free time because I wasn't in the shot every day but I was in Mexico eventually I got f****** cabin fever down there and I couldn't wait to get home because they're a long time and I've nothing to do and I wrote a lot of the novel there and put it away again and then I was in a career slump in the early 90s had finished with acting mostly I didn't want to do that anymore I've done a few sitcoms and I didn't want to be the office creep forever and so I was just like nowhere and that's when I finished it and also that's like the year I did cocaine which it probably would not have finished it without that only one year wanted to let you know me I'm a pothead like you I it's not my drug but you know if you really insist you can get in you can get into any drug and I just happen to be at this point in my life where I was vulnerable to any I've nothing to do all day I wasn't working so and it helps you write it help productivity due to productivity drivers drug that I liked because I wasn't social on it I just don't like to have sex on it most men did not I love that and and right but I didn't want to talk somebody that guy I don't know he's never that guy and talked a Blue Streak know but but it helped me you know concentrate and organized and that kind of stuff and you know and then I was probably smoking pot to I was smoking cigarettes a year that was not a healthy year remember you know you could cocaine which is kids that is the worst drug it really is because you got a little honeymoon. And then that quickly goes away and then you're chasing that high and you know it's not healthy and then you know you're you're trying to at the end of the night take the edge off you know you're into that put the Ed it said that was I never touched it I got lucky very smart gout is it still in publication the great question I'm finding so much about my own life here I didn't know cuz like I didn't correct with being redone how much from my arrow like guys who grew up and shot hold up when we were just starting it was huge fault for not pushing that through I guess but I thought at the time it would have really would have made a good movie but it's Robbie too late now and I was doing that well remember that movie came out with Tom Hanks remember that flashlight punch lidocaine Tom Hanks was good I mean Tom Hanks could could have been a stand-up he did it as good as you can possible possible but they just never capture the whole essence of it and also when you trying to have someone I see this on maisel no I haven't seen that yet some show the one I think it's Jim Carrey show on Showtime about dying up here and I like the show but whenever you showing a stand-up comic and your kids acting you're acting as a stand-up and then the audience has to laugh is something about it that isn't it just you can tell it's not real it's like a boxing scene in the movie same thing a little bit yeah it's in you can't as any giant comedy star-nosed you can walk out at a comedy club and you'll get the biggest Ovation in the world 2 minutes later you can be dying because it's involuntary after thrilled to see you but then if you don't say something funny that can't then I Gotta Laugh it's also very uniquely live thing. Like you have to be right I was hitting like if you watch a special on TV you're really getting 50% of funny your rent you have to be there live you if you're there live you'll get 100% of it so not only that not only watching it not life right because you've got a recording of it but now it's also a fake recording so it's a guy pretending to be on stage and audience pretending to be an audience in the whole thing yeah so maybe it's a blessing in disguise I kept her going up drunk and talking s*** and then people telling her like you can probably do, they like it seems chaotic it gets a little less realistic as time goes on but you watch that show and I like the first two seasons the third season of hope they're not losing me here and it took place in the 50s yeah yeah people telling her like you could probably do, they look at seems chaotic and it gets a little less realistic as time goes on but you watch that show and you like it I like the first two seasons the third season of hope you're not losing me here and it took place in the 50s yeah yeah</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> what year what season are you guys coming into Norfolk I don't know Seasons it's hard to adjust couple years and we started on HBO in 2003 but then we used to do for the first two years I had to do two seasons they took took them a while to get the idea that this is not like The Sopranos or any other show did this kind of show is a habit show it has to be on most of the year we used to do a season from February so like may let me be off for 4 months and come back for a few months in the fall that's not the way you can do it when you're following events alive show so finally somewhere in there they just okay so then it was one long season 2 supposed to so I guess they counted the early years has two we've been on HBO since 2003 but of course I started to you were on the old show Politically Incorrect somebody sent me a clip of that wow I couldn't even bear to watch it just from the way it was too sad time is cruel actually we look better now just because we look douchier younger of course I mean that's the trade-off in the answers that you're here when you're younger but that started in 93 so I've already passed my we did a 25th anniversary show about a year-and-a-half ago yeah and the fall of 18 it aired I couldn't believe that you know they're trying to bring back Politically Incorrect who is pay whoever came to me a while ago with hosting it a course but it was somebody else hosting it remove to ABC I think we probably sold them the rights to the show which is was probably stupid but at the time it made sense and good luck with it I'm not doing it was one of those question though my manager calls me up because you're not going to want to do this but I'm obligated to tell you why wouldn't you want to do like when someone doesn't show leave it alone and I know right leave it if you laughed and they started doing real time with Adam Carolla right you know exactly what they will be doing format sometimes can I watch or listen to you it's it's not even there I don't get America like people's attention span is either 7 seconds or 3 hours between I mean I do like being forced to condense and four people I always think of the person watching my show is the person who is interested in current events but doesn't have the time to follow it during the week they've got kids and jobs and lives they are going to watch me to catch them up and it's my job to obviously entertain them but also to the Pointe at what's important what what happened this week that you should know about somewhere in that live our whether it's in the monologue or in new rules or the editorial I do at the end or in the panel somewhere I want to cover everything I think you should doesn't necessarily mean it's the things that the newspaper or other outlets thought was important what I think is really important that's what I'm going to cover so there is something to be said for condensing is also a lot to be said for letting it breathe you know I mean letting it breathe I do miss that sometimes I wish I could and very often we're in the middle of a discussion and I have to move on I feel like the way things are going now with streaming like I know HBO has their new streaming service maybe they could just give you an option to let some some of those conversations lengthen out to seems like some of them you just getting started you have to cut him off your right and again sometimes people just want the headlines for you off and I'm reading something and it's too long I just think you should have given me the New York Times starts every article not just tell me what happened don't give me the background on a rocky road and Afghanistan is very label which one side and movies are too long too long people need at but these kind of conversations lend themselves more than most art forms to just letting it happen and yeah it's more natural I mean I like the fact that unlike my early days when you sweat backstage and you'd hear The Tonight Show band playing in summer I did I really have no Lista question no no I don't want you I like you but I'm sure I'm not going to run out of things to ask you or talk to you about but that's a talent itself that you could do that off the top of your head I think you think it's not that much of a talent but trust me a lot of people could not do that I don't know if I would trust myself if you said you have two hours with this guy I would I would be in the back of my mind like s*** what if an hour what if an hour and 10 minutes in I'm like f*** I can't think of one more things you can imagine if you and I were at dinner together talk about it's probably true so that's this okay the same s*** followed by dead air why is complete dead air</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> I want to know how the divorce laws came to be I do I want to know somebody must have written a book on it I just want to know how we got to this place where you know first of all this idea that you have to live in the style of which you become accustomed I can help you here I can help you in great lawyers make a lot of money if there's a large settlement to its lawyer yes lawyers don't make a lot of money if there's no settlement you know Phil Hartman when he's getting divorced when the things you said to me I go to to f****** give her half come on man you make a lot of money it was a crazed like a 2/3 and I've had friends that have gotten divorced and even though they were they had come to an agreement with the the acts like let's listen to this this and you'll get this and I'll get this by then the lawyers jump in he's trying to f*** you and this know they're trying to f*** you over that deserve more actually the plot of the movie Marriage to be seen Mary story it's terrific I was again it at the beginning because it was about an actress and a theater director and I'm like Jesus f****** Christ can't you at least pretend that there are people in America not outside of your exact circular been so many big movies you know that are just about your world of Show Business terrific movie about it is no bells and whistles it's just we're married we seem very happy and then well we're not happy and we're going to get divorced and then we're going to just just do it amicably and not getting lawyers involved and then it all falls apart and once it goes down that path that you're talkin about it just becomes as vicious as anything without guns okay no children didn't have children and it dragged on for more than I think almost three years and even though they did some kind of a sort of conclusion he was paying for his wife's lawyer I go like you're paying for the general the arm is trying to kill you you're paying for someone to f*** you in the ass you're getting f***** in the ass world of men broken by but you know they've people unfortunately get a horrible disease like cancer and they say I couldn't have gotten through it without my wife I always think yeah and maybe she gave it to you of course literally but I just mean that when you're in a bad relationship the stress we don't know what contributes all the things to cancer but that certainly is I'm sure one of them and then going through a divorce like that I've seen people like you say broken the attract and it's a system the reason why the divorce laws are set up the way they're set up people think all we're protecting women horseshit they're doing it so that they can extract the maximum amount of money out of the mail that way the lawyer gets the biggest chunk that they can possibly get most lawyers have a the work on a percentage basis especially if a woman doesn't have as much money or if she's you know the oil come to her look we've got a deal here we'll we'll figure this out I don't pay me now we're going to make sure we the most will will take care of it all in the end and this is what has happened to several of my friends have been divorced and you know what it is once you see it what I got and I understand and I accept and I support is child support I mean I've I grew up with a deadbeat dad my dad never paid for s*** and I have many friends have also experienced a lot of financial hardship growing up because their dad was a piece of s*** and didn't want to pay for the children the people very close to me but when there's a big difference between that a man taking responsibility for his children big difference between that and alimony alimony is creepy there's something creepy about like my friend like I said didn't even have a child with this woman he is still paying her by the way this is the same guy very good friend of mine has been divorced for 14 years has been married for 12 to a new woman still paying old woman and my job is like you f***** her so hard she can't work right but she literally can't work cuz he be he's a wealthy man he made good money and he works really hard as he's not in the business he's at his real job and he works you know long f****** hours every day and he has his own business and he has to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to someone he doesn't even talk to you anymore I go to the doctor what did jail every night because he couldn't make the payments and they would like let him out on weekends to do rounds and stuff but he was its I got a better one for you when I get angry when he was getting divorced was when he was on Newsradio so it was a financial Peak you know he was the star of the show is making a lot of money right and so his so yeah I get to that that shirt is in Canada right he the judge tells him I don't make that kind of money anymore that was an extraordinary kind of my life it's very hard to make that kind of money you know I'm an actor or just the doctor's the judge rather says your ability to pay has no relation to your obligation to pay WOW think of that just pause here for a moment what a statement where else would we say that it's insane talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars hundreds of thousands like as if he's supposed to conjure this up like his careers about supposed to magically resurrect itself in some really financially viable and strong and able to do everything we can do but when it comes to this it's like we got to take care of them dependent because the men in general are in control the finance or make more money and they can extract more money for nausea while people turning it down it's dark man I mean the only time that I know of is Tom Arnold the males ready we got one on the board there's like if the board was like here if it was it would be a f****** billion scratches on one side and four lines of the one through it and then next to it is like Tom Arnold I never uncouple of the dude never understood the concept of marriage because when people would say why don't you want to get married at a why would I invite the federal and state government into my love life otherwise is not real if you don't get it the sign piece of paper what the f*** do you have just your feelings for that other night good enough friends she had to tell her friends and he really cares that's what's real the paper is what's fake the made me worried about divorces whenever getting divorced so I don't know about you f*** you're doing like why why you're getting so upset about this bill just signed a paper and get married we're going to be together forever I don't know what you're worried about Jesus Christ love me hahaha but also like humans change it's like we said it's so funny when you you can tell you about anything else while I'm not married to it you know do you want that thing they're at married to it but with a human that thing that's most malleable were like we did this before right this real some countries have like you could get married for like 7 when the moment comes because you're so co-dependent girls are not going to tolerate interment cuz I cry if you stuck with Dave at Dave wouldn't ask the boring. It's funny to sign the contract you be fine girl how do you mention Tom Arnold I had him on the very first episode of Politically Incorrect I think with Roseanne and they were talking about marriage and he said the great thing about marriage is when you have a big fight and somebody says I'm leaving you can go you can't we're married and I got what he was saying some people like that that you have this this self-imposed barrier that for difficult you know or when they make you look at the sonogram when you want an abortion in some States look at your f****** baby on the computer screen there and tell come back tomorrow and tell me you want to kill that kid you know you were waiting for you have to cool off you can't just leave where is if you're not married you can unless you live together that's more complicated or kids are more complicated but yeah look at your f****** baby on the computer screen there and tell come back tomorrow and tell me you want to kill that kid you know you were waiting for you have to cool off you can't just leave where is if you're not married you can unless you live together that's more complicated or kids are more complicated but yeah</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> you think should go on with Louis Louis CK you mention him I know more about it than most people could have talked to Louis about it but what happened versus what's being portrayed as what happened there were there's a lot of stuff that's just not true lucky block in anybody's door woods and what's unfair is that he cannot say it he wanted you if you engage and defend yourself correct the record then you make it worse so you're in this sort of purgatory where if you hear things that are not true you also cannot say anything about it that's it that's it unfair place to be and also like is everything a hanging offence my problem with some of the me-too stuff and of course I think like every right-thinking person it was a great thing that happened that men have been put on notice that you're playing with fire balls and you just can't get away with a lot of the s*** you use regular men in positions of power and are slaves but there is just no consistency Charlie Sheen I like them but he got Super Bowl commercial last year he did way worse things that Louis CK you couldn't get Louis CK are they still giving people I mean at this Litany of things that are way worse than whacking off in front of people which is not cool either of course it's me Louie did Lee Lewis College eyes and own up to it and I just think the there where is the consistency and also where is the is it is it is everything a life sentence that Louis is is a horrible person forever or is there some point where we used to go yes a person pays his debt to society in some way and then you know I know you're allowed back I feel I just feel bad for him I mean I feel like he did weird s*** that he shouldn't have done for sure and I think he knows that I know he knows that but what is the proper punishment and is and who decides it is definitely working again so all the people that are complaining and bitching about our seas know you can hear a lot of theaters is doing his touring again right when you selling his tickets to his fan but he wants to do beers before you can have a special but I'm just saying I'm just pulling it out of my ass I'm just saying what we need some sort of it's been more than two years some sort of me to court yeah that by Judge Rose McGowan how do you decide when you know a person has been punished enough and what what is the gar jerking off I don't like being alone the rest of the material he does about it but you know he asked he asked can I jerk off in front of you when they said yes he did it it's not a good thing nothing good about anyone else and he knows it and I'm not defending them but right people are portraying it is far worse than like he went up at skankfest in New York and people went crazy and cheered and I repost the video of it and someone Twitter weather rare time to look drugged and he assaulted women he asked if he could jerk off in front of people and then he did there's some question as to whether I jerked off on the phone with somebody I don't think that's assault either it's kind of creepy not even kinda it stopped I'm sure he would say it's creepy but we're not talking about someone assaulted people like you can't just change the definition of the word present make you feel bad but hating someone now I also read but I don't know if it's true if his management I think threatened women who were going to talk about this or prevented someone's career from moving because of this if that happened that's amazed almost worse yes that's a really bad so yes I don't know if that's true and he's not allowed to talk make a Twitter just talking about it a few times and I think he just decides at the end of the day it's just better just keep pushing ahead and write and his new our apparently I'm not advertising for it but from everybody that I heard it's f****** amazing cuz all the pain while the trailer he apparently has a just better just keep pushing ahead and write and his new our apparently I'm not advertising for it but from everybody that I heard it's f****** amazing cuz all the pain while the trailer he apparently has a</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> categorize people is being like you said 1 or 0 binary like either chosen or iridium very careful with how you talk or you get labeled and in one or two of those categories and people are so scared now communicate I had a conversation with a friend a while back and he is crazy conversation it was alcohol involved that women get so much money and divorce of all the s*** they've been through for men over the years and I was home plate I mean like what that it wouldn't have to do with money and divorce like if it that's an individual person it's getting money from another individual person is she getting she collecting is this like reparations for the horrible things that have happened for women and he goes well and you so he starts getting defensive because we would have income inequality the women have to deal with Jesus will you know that's not real right angles we me niego it's not like they have the same jobs both the man and woman are both mailman they both the same amount of houses but the man makes a dollar when the woman makes $0.70 because that's exactly as I go the f*** it is what it is still illegal everybody walk on a mic drop want kids in cages but there's a whole discussion to be had about the immigration here as opposed to just kids in cage or Islam a phobia of course that is a real thing that exists but there's a whole other discussion but just these the left often uninformed but they have these bullet points that they feel like they definitely can shut a conversation. But I mean the just stop people from talking but fortunately known the actual statistics until when we were talking about I was saying don't know you choose different jobs and also they negotiate for themselves differently they need to negotiate for themselves better jobs to get better raises Shores really explaining how to do this and in the end just even maybe possibly against your better instincts to exert yourself and show that you understand your value and this is what men do and this is why men get raises and often times women just kind of keep it to themselves and their little nervous about it but it is amazing it made you mention divorce yeah they don't sir Tazewell going for a raise but only the divorce thing that can go both ways if the woman is the one who has more money women right up to like when I hear that I might go to the gym yes you should go to the gym man much to make fun of men's rights guys but I had one of them on my one of my specials had a bit about it where they were saying you know that men get raped more often than women I go yeah by other men you f****** idiot they're rapin dues what do you think the cheerleaders are there raindrops and Christina Hoff Sommers yes no she was recently and we were talking about the fact that also they don't bring up a lot of the time that most of the horrible dirty jobs in the world yeah for the same crime so we're not crying about being men we're just saying as she says life is a complex yes mixture of advantages and disadvantages I think the pendulum swinging the other way though I think really dumb statements like f*** all white men like we choose to her on Twitter and people used to like a plot and retweet it I think people in Ellicott Co at the f*** a little out there but I have heard when now it's going in the other direction because the races but at the point of say 6 months a year ago when lots of people were getting into the race at some point there were 24 Democrats in there and when a white guy would get in it was very common to hear do we need another white guy and to judge whether someone is qualified right we are using race and gender to say whether someone is qualify just so we understand what we're doing here because I don't think that's exactly what Martin Luther King meant when he said judge by the content of their character and that the color of their skin which seems to elude a certain say when they don't realize it's like people to think they thought him f****** punch I'm going to punch you back like this is this is not it's not that simple when you when you if you go around judging people based on their gender and their their color and their race guess what they're going to do that to you now like this is terrible strategy</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> Bernie's 2 left disease for a real idiot word wrong question debate tonight the media asks the wrong question which is what would you do this is a question only makes sense if you're running for King the question should not be what would you do the question is what can you get through what can you propose that Mitch McConnell will not either block or you can override with votes because that's a very discussion what Bernie Sanders wants to do we shouldn't even be talking about cuz it's not going to happen the free education paying back student loan debt medicare-for-all for all even if the Democrat wins the election this still going to be half the country that's Republican and half the Congress is going to be Republican and district and wanted Democrats are not for this stuff you know when the Democrats took over the house in 2018 it was moderate Democrats who won their elections it wasn't the far left so so you get four years of spinning wheel in the mud hoping to get some traction yeah if he gets in again it what can get through Congress what can you get a consensus on what what can you make possible Obama when he did Healthcare said yes we were starting from scratch it would make sense to go for a single-payer system but we're not starting from scratch we're starting from a system where most people already have health insurance through their employer it's a crazy story how that happened it was World War and they couldn't raise wages cuz that was the loss of it to find a way to give employer something else so they gave them health insurance but that's what we have now and a lot of people like it or say they like it I don't think a lot of people like arguing with their insurer company but they were afraid of something worse and I don't blame them you know if you're going to tell me the government and I'm a Democrat but if you going to tell me the government is going too smoothly handle taking over something that large I am going to be a little skeptical we should be there smoothly handle anything there's no evidence Progressive when you go down the list of things that the progressives have accomplished especially in my Lifetime Eyecare the mall Social Security on that was in my lifetime but they improved it in my lifetime Medicare Medicaid these are great programs I mean before Social Security the senior poverty rate was like in the 28% or something and then it went down below 10 it was a success but when you look at what the government really what they're big successes of amounted to its passing out money that very often they don't have that's what they're really good running a giant Healthcare System especially when the politicians who are proposing these systems will not a talk enough about aging you can't pass out all this money with if you're if you're going to allow people hospitals pharmaceutical companies to judge anything they want when the price of an EpiPen can go up from $12 to 1,200 overnight that just can't happen and also they don't ask people to lift a finger to take care of their own health nobody's Healthcare System is going to work unless you involve people at some sinks get in the game you can't like not tell the people look you can't keep eating as much as you want and a shity food as you want and expect us to cover the bill you just can't that is not something that anybody wants to hear that oh I know because I did that editorial and and then remember that people got upset people did not people loved it until James Corden said something oh that's right he had them first of all he did that and in doing that made Fat Jokes which was okay I did not buy the way to literally save lives if he had taken the opposite approach he took the easy way out of course you can always get Applause for saying okay let's let's boo the mean man who told the truth that's not brave principal of my point was a that you can't solve Healthcare unless you ask the people to participate in that that was one and also that we've gone to this place where we're proud of it we're proud of being unhealthy Weight Watchers had to take the weight and Watchers out of their title it's WWE now it's like being fat isn't bad what's bad is someone pointing out that fat is bad but I mean I read the statistic in that editorial 40,000 people a month a month die from obesity that's a crazy number that is a crazy number we have to somehow reversed idea that we have in this country not just about obesity but about a lot of things where I'm perfect the way I am I am perfect the way I am and if you say different you're a very bad person that's not a good place to be it's not healthy for anybody it you're you're protecting people's emotions but shielding them from a possible moment that might make them realize that they are eating themselves to death and I mean I said it also in the peace beauty is in the eye of the beholder that's fine whatever you think is beautiful that's your deal but health is science yeah that's science and when we get apoplectic when there's fifty deaths from shootings or something a month yeah it's very bad and we should be serious about that problem but 50,000 every month and that's just what they're counting from the big ones cancer diabetes and heart disease this literally nothing about your health that is improved by being overweight so you know I said we shouldn't talk people but you don't compare it to anything else I also owned up to the fact that I used to drink too much and I smoked but I didn't defend it would someone said you know you went kind of hard last night with the drinking I didn't say how dare you drunk shame me that fat like he can fix that in a couple of months that's not that hard know he took it was it was opportunistic and I could have literally lost an opportunity to save lives because as someone who does struggle with weight he could have taken the opposite approach and said you know he still makes a really good point and we should we should look at how we are dealing with it I I noticed Jillian Michaels the fitness expert sugarlash it for lizzo for Lucia and you know if if you want to be whatever way you want to be that's fine but it's wrong to shame a fitness expert for saying this isn't healthy or gets even do that it's not going to be that amazing when she gets diabetes diabetes another one and look this is valid it's valid that in this country it is a lot harder to eat right if you're poor yes and we should totally address that doubt if it's on any candidates top 10 list but the way the food situation and subsidies are done in this country is horrible but given that let's not just throw up our hands and say where they can't do country and because it's harder let's not even try it is harder to eat right on a budget but I'll tell you something something you never need to have with your food soda which is a large part of it okay and you'll save money you don't have to have soda you don't have a Snickers bar a banana is $0.19 so it's not impossible Adele got s*** recently because she Apache any fat people go eat something eat something I'm fine what so you can feel better about your weight problem I should eat and get that too willing heavy people have a fan have with someone that they're a fan of that's all so heavy like James Corden like so he's heavy he's got people in the audience at love him and they love him standing up for other happy. singer super-talented extremely popular and overweight like yeah it's fine it's fine I'm like Adele everyone's fine then she loses weight like you feel like she's betraying you because one of the reasons why I like you is because you're fat and you're not fat anymore it wasn't that long ago that we were applauding people when they lost weight remember when Oprah came out that time was she was in the 80s I think but she had lost a whole bunch of it's a very famous picture I think she's she's like in jeans and she's got to like really thin waist and you know she was raising your hands and Triumph and every was applauding I guess that's bad now because again you have to be perfect the way you are and if you criticize that then you're a bad person this picture I think she's she's like in jeans and she's got to like really thin waist and you know she was raising your hands and try if and every was applauding I guess that's bad now because again you have to be perfect the way you are and if you criticize that then you're a bad person</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> yeah I mean this is like what we're talking about with us growing up that life was rougher in life is easier today and but you have more access to information so maybe it could be better and then things seem to be moving in a better Direction terms of things being safer less violence less crime less rape and then people also get upset at you bring up those statistics that's where it's really interesting to pay car gets attacked for just stating statistical facts to sit and he's not making value judgments he's just saying hey things are if you look at the overall numbers of things this is the safest time to be alive ever it's in the people know but what about this what about that horrible of our era that we live in that fax almost always come second guess your political agenda comes first and if it doesn't fit in then we don't want to hear those facts and that's the left and the right it is the left and the right it's both and it's it's hippie is it to be something that everybody was Jack's it to be something that angered everyone it shouldn't be tied to one party or another party and it really should be something that if there's a there's a real problem with communication in this Society one of them is the denial of actual facts and information if we if we know think we have Rock Solid threads it's whether it's about climate change because it's about war the budget whatever the f*** it is if you have a real number yeah you want to spin and deny like that that's a giant problem it's a giant problem right I get madder at the left because I want them to be better and they should be better and they're there their the science party and they're supposedly the fact people I expect this s*** from the right I'm denying climate change and so forth have been doing that for a long time the left has his dirty thing if you disagree with him in any way you could come on all right person like right I mean a small sliver or rated well I got stuck in this all right category make you guys are out of your f****** mind I've never voted right in my life right I know but there's a there's a I feel like I'm sure you just sometimes a man without a country and there's a group of us Sam Harris find a party and we don't chase these virtues signalers who are always as a friend of mine said they wake up offended yeah and I am always reading a story like daily I read something and what goes through my mind is this country knows completely binary there's only two camps we're totally tribal you either red or blue liberal or servative and everything that one side does that anybody does that represent that side has to be owned by that entire side because people go you or your the party of so whenever there's something on the left that's cuckoo crazy we all own it and that's one reason why Trump won because people you go through the polling his fans are not oblivious to his marriage law what they love about him but they all say they love is he wasn't politically correct it's hard to measure how much people have been choking on that political correctness they do not want to walk on eggshells they do want do not want to think that one little misstep and we'll get fired or be castigated at least you're not just famous people I mean this these are regular people and I think when someone reads the kind of stories you see everyday and it's an eye roll and it's a eye roll at the left that's when you lose people I give examples about two weeks ago the Giants my football team the New York football Giants cut his name is Janoris Jenkins yes we have to say the r word okay first of all I don't understand why that generation feels the need to engage with their fans on Twitter but he was and some guy needs a teaching social media with criticizing him and he's a good cornerback or whatever he is and the was criticizing him and he answered back again I don't know why but saying that I'm pretty good I only can do my job. Retard explain so then the guy the fan says what was it matter the team is losing and that's when Janoris Jenkins said I can only do my job retard and cut like cut from the team got like the heck use a day and first but I think he said there's something I thought it was a hood thing you know maybe Janoris Jenkins didn't get the memo because he's not Twitter 24/7 and living with the woke stirs that we don't do this anymore oh sorry I just figured if we don't do this anymore my bad and move on with our lives instead of know you're cancelled your cut you are irredeemable yeah like that and it just all goes into the bin left-wing assholes I don't like him but I don't want to live in that world these people are even f****** cry all goes into the bin left-wing and that's when people go you know what trumps and assholes I don't like him but I don't want to live in that world these people are even f****** crazier and that is the great danger of re-electing him and the very well maybe do it</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> series or something along those lines I'm absolutely convinced most of these guys believe what they say and I made maybe they're bullshitters at the start or they only partially believe but they they repeat their rhetoric their followers getting a positive reinforcement take time to believe it and you know David koresh he was willing to die for his beliefs and he also was having sex and his ex-girlfriend grew up in one of these sort of religious cults and it was the same deal that had guy was having sex with all the women and you know he would have sex with different people's wives and everybody had to let him I don't know if you ever read. Jon Jon krakauer's book under the banner of Heaven this is the guy that does the mountain climber that did Into Thin Air and and and the the one about the Alaskan kid anyway he wrote this book called under the banner of Lori from The New Yorker something many realize this takes him down the path of this incredible world of polygamy would still goes on now legally is not legal but they marry one and then the others are so-called Sister Wives and they're just there and they live on these in these border towns along the border between Colorado and Utah like Colorado City and all that I've been through some of these places it's liked it sophina going all the way back to the founding of the religion and Joseph Smith and you know he gets this Revelation from God that well basically he's banging the woman down the street he's married and so he gets this Revelation from God and this scenario in the book where he says I have to marry this bye-bye have to start seeing other guys no no God was very specific about this is just for the guide and I know you talked to get one of my buddies they were there they heard it also and this is the first page of the Book of Mormon is an affidavit these are the people that heard the Revelation and that they all sign it and it's like okay so this is how it starts why did this isn't even like it they're bad people when you 14 years old you are a developing entity your frontal lobe not fully-formed you don't really know what you did practicing sentences exert your influence he was in trouble with the law and other issues and then he got in trouble there he was killed and Sansa cult when the leader dies now there's that there's a ton of it there's a critical. If you get a new Dynamic leader to take over like in the case of Scientology David miscavige took over after El Ron Hubbard passed over to the other side and he managed to keep a world religion and they just went to Utah to get away from federal authorities know how much of a hit is Scientology taking from that Leah Remini saved I'm not seeing any data like a memberships and they're all secret about that anyway it's Brighter Day to so who knows I can't imagine they could survive while they could survive cuz I have tons of money through real estate Investments but I can't imagine their numbers or could be doing anything but ranking than the HBO documentary that's really that's really the only the best way to do it not top-down laws against cult unless you're doing something obviously illegal but just bottom up members speaking out his dad on as well just it is very strange that the United States government is allowing those people to be tax-exempt I mean with all I know it's available go and look at what they're proposing and what they believe in the thetans and the frozen's entities that are dropped into the volcano but they're the only major organization I've ever seen that beat the IRS and they did it through thousands of lawsuits I think I stood him like 3,500 times or something that they had every single member that they could get to do it right as well they were getting all their members to Sue at they were so angry I was a story I really don't think any relationship with what we know about reality old Voodoo superstitious nonsense not have to pay taxes and exert extreme power politically socially or economically it's crazy I'm from religion foundation and some of these other organizations ACLU or you know trying to combat some of this but but legally how do you distinguish that from say a nonprofit like Doctors Without Borders one of these other groups Foundation mostly expenses yeah well Supreme Court then they have a problem is where do you draw the line by do you cuz somebody says well I have a goofy believe the Jane's have some weird beliefs or something but you know but there but their man in the soup kitchens are helping the poor and there's no corruption what to do between them and the scientologists to say hey religious beliefs that do you sound goofy but unit us their true what's the difference will the Mormons are fascinating to me because they do seem goofy when you look at the idea that Joseph Matthew was a fourteen-year-old found golden tablets that contain the Lost work of Jesus and only he could read them cuz he had a magic searstone right and then when the the local townspeople came to see what where are these Stones all the Angels came and took them away because I did not believe it it's so Preposterous but Christians no longer consider them a call because they're pretty far out but most mainstream Christian said yeah yeah they're Christians accept Jesus as their Club but I think the way they deal with community each other it's like a very very warm and friendly and family environment and most of Mormons and I've met that are practicing have been very nice people poor people about this like capital gains on California so if you sell your house and make a profit you got to give 10% of that to turn I just your income is your paycheck. Yeah and they're pretty pretty strict about that as far as I know mostly goes for good causes that really does help poor people</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> everyone's mad about everything like Donald Trump has everyone's mad the picture I swear on CNN words like I was literally like that is Donald Trump afraid of stairs would like the Chiron the lower third but to me I'm like that's why it goes back to the fact is I think this is important component to maybe making you understand what happened a little bit better cuz you're not in the in that ecosystem but I think you can relate because you're seeing it happen elsewhere is that the gaming media is dying and they're dying because no one really trust or cares trust them or cares what they have to say anymore people in 10 year old and 15 year olds today or not which is why the only people unanimously pretty much that came out in my defense were YouTubers because they know that their the next rung of this evolution of the way we absorb in and communicate and absorb information and have news to me while these people to your point already clickbait trying to stay relevant but no one really cares what they're saying anyway so they're in their death throes this is a way for them to take shots in multiple people at the same time contact yes and PewDiePie and I had fewer than 10,000 Twitter followers and I'm ready for a site no one reads and I'm trying my hardest to stay relevant and to do my thing I'd be pretty mad too if I saw a guy that turns on his camera and speaks whatever he wants and get the amount of views in 30 minutes and I'll get the entire year the idea that anybody's views is somehow or another taking away from your views is just straight famine mentality is plenty of lies to go around your showing it right now with your your new project sure but I'm just like that I'm just saying thought process sucks you worship on television is actually starting to be outpaced by YouTube so that's over now right to video online or video on demand that's just YouTube and so people are looking at the situation and actually precipitating it happening quicker because they lie million subscribers and he's a millionaire just be clear I've never I don't really know him very well I think I've had one or two communicate with him at some point but I don't know once I don't have a horse in the race he lives in England I think he's Swedish or something of that nature but he lives in England and he has a mass of you two following every video he does will have 10 12 15 million views as is his right and the thing that really caught on was that he was using this this app or this this this article fiber which is this kind of taskrabbit kind of thing where it's like you can pay people to do whatever you want and he paid some of the things he did were otherwise what he paid these guys and some country to hold up these like death to all Jews signs or something like that as part of a joke and tasteless a lot of people and this combined with some other imagery had been using some like kind of fascist or Nazi imagery and some other things I've been going on over the months and so this newspaper 1 cm in all this has been quite a lot of personal and economic destruction for the intent of what he was trying to do especially with telling people to not be Nazis he was like mocking people that were being Nazis and they use that to say this guy is pretending to be a Nazi punching up now on YouTubers but really cause a lot of silarius on a YouTuber your punching up to attack him cuz he's the king cuz he's the media Elite I mean that's the media elite mean it's like an independent reporter attacking the middle ABC news or something like that and it showed a lot of cowardice it showed a lot of half-cocked thinking on their on the back on them showed a level an egg using this word because I don't think innately it's necessarily a bad thing that they could drive you forward to this at the level of jealousy that play with a lot of these kind of struggling to get 10,000 views and a story they write is going to look at a guy like this that can do one video where he talks about farts and he makes you know his 7 million views or something like that I don't get this but I'm not going to like sit here in like rain on their parade that's their right have an audience that's totally fine maybe look at yourself and why you don't have an audience may be able to yourself and realize that you've been doing this for so long you're so proud of that why isn't anyone listening to you could it be you you know instead of instead of looking around for people to assassinate which is what basically Happening Here my where you are now is just lost and a lot of it has to do and that's what I was saying with media precipitating the Fall by not telling the truth by not doing the right thing I think the media in terms of pullet politics residences really rebounding from the fact that they thought Clinton was going to win today. They can get away with saying and doing anything for that means to an end the Donna brazile thing for instance where she was feeding questions to the Clinton campaign is so incredible so it shows such a level of why isn't systemic inherent bias they don't they're going to get away with all that stuff I don't know what's going on with I know he could be a f****** Manchurian Candidate you know but I don't believe a word they say to listen to people like you to listen to people even Alex Jones listen to Dave Rubin to Listen to Problem it's the race for clicks is the race for money as the race for prominences the race for relevance and not honesty not transparency and not a real objective sense of what the truth is and what it would the actual facts of a story are that's where journalism is a different thing now because it's now a entertainment show it's an entertainment show that also has the news in it but that's why the women are so hot that's why the women on Fox news or wearing these tiny little dresses and they have beautiful legs and heels on they're talking about important issues but they're giving you a little bit and I candy while they're doing it weird growth. Where where we have this incredible access to information and the ability to spread it like we have now with with social media on with YouTube and all these different things were anybody can kind of hop in and all sudden get a platform like this Pewdiepie Pewdiepie wasn't a star it wasn't a politician and you wasn't an actor before this you just got up and he connected with people and carved out this path for himself and pretty pretty much anybody can kind of do that now I mean there's it's not easy it's not okay if it was easy everyone would do it but not insurmountable and I wonder what the next stage is an in terms of the building share information if it's going to change password or it's at now and get to some new level yeah I think I think you're right in the sense that the internet specifically had taken off so quickly the World Wide Web you know is only 24 years old internet way older but the way we communicate with each other now is so different than even HughesNet in the 80s or these kind of university University Communications that they had going on the seventies where they were sharing example you don't need Gatekeepers anymore there are no Gatekeepers you can go start a YouTube channel Now find an audience gain thousand subscribers make a lot of money and say what you want and that's scary to the traditional Gatekeepers and they don't like it and they're get there if they're fighting after the so transparent and it's so self-serving when I don't we need a meeting that we can trust but I don't think we need the media as it is right now either because the media we have right now is bloated dishonest partisan political Ian and motivated I don't we need a meeting that we can trust but I don't think we need the media as it is right now either because the media we have right now is bloated dishonest partisan political Ian and motivated all the things that don't really serve a purpose to educating and informing some of the days of Cronkite are gone</div>

	<div> <a class="links" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baq4XzKOybI"> Joe Rogan &amp; Colin Moriarty on Progressive Politics in the Gaming Industry </a>
		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> bubble in the video game industry with these people that are predominantly left-wing and predominantly Progressive look what I say Progressive Progressive is kind of a dirty word now it is coming anymore those things are like ideologies the people subscribe you in a very very rigid way what did you find was an issue when people found out about your extreme understanding and respect for the history of the United States we have like not all my ideas are radical or even outside of the mainstream socially I'm probably further to the left then maybe people the legalization of prostitution I'm for a lot of these things that are very far to the left socially that we probably could find some agreement on somewhere and we can work on those things and get those things done together because I say also like hey the income taxes predatory add this one thing that we have a problem with now we're going to make it clear about that issue when it comes to small-government like you wanting small-government what's the opposition to that what do they say but they even look at that at the push too far on the on the system with you I'm trying my hardest is is that they you have to agree with them lockstep right they see you in one way that is that is is injurious to their cause or two that is conflicting or contrary to what they believe they do not give a f*** about anything else you believe people really were running me out on a rail out of the gaming industry with I told you everything you need to know about the the intent that they don't they don't want allies in different ways the Allied in different clothes they want just they just want complete you know it's very well they just want you to be completely like them if you're not like them they don't want anything to do with you at all but we've turned a corner where in many ways the right is more tolerant than left to variations in their ideology where is the right is much more tolerant to people that support gay marriage the right is much more tolerant to people that you fill in the blanks is a bunch of different rights that the right would sort of except from someone who also voted Republican the left isn't like if you got to the point where I like I got a heated argument with someone wants about abortion which I'm pro-choice but I was saying well essentially what else criticism of a Richard Dawkins Voorhees comparing a human embryo to a pig fetus or Pig embryo whatever get there with the terms used but I'm like let's ridiculous cuz one of them is going to become a person if you don't take it out of your body that was the idea behind it like you can't you can't use that sort of an analogy because it's not true I mean just one has the potential for being a person I was being accused of being right wing because of it life like a pig embryos never going to be my neighbor Mike and I was just playing but that baby I'm not saying you should be forced to make that baby a person and keep anybody when it's a few cells and then two weeks old and then I'm not saying that you can't choose when to terminate your pregnancy what I'm saying is your terminating a pregnancy we both know what you're doing I'm not saying you shouldn't be able to do it but you pretended it's not messy and nobody wants it to be messy nobody wants to be naked issue they wanted to be cut and dry if you're on the left in particular it's pro-choice woman's reproductive choice that freedom of your body to do what you want I get all that I'm 100% with you but let's let's not lie about what it is because as soon as we as soon as we distort the reality of what the thing is then we put up his ideological boundaries and blinders and we make communication very difficult and we make these rigid ideologies almost like a religion they are there almost like dog and when you do I put it when you do that you have a real problems because people can't communicate so if someone these are the things that I I forgot for so long in a way because I was riding bike games which I love I love games are important part of great but being able to engage with someone like yourself with someone like a Dave Rubin or someone like a Steven Crowder whoever might be I was on Glenn Beck's radio show last week but it brings out an energy me where am I picking finally engaged with people that know what the f*** they're talking about in this particular realm which I think is so exciting and so interesting and we can have you all we had we debated we don't agree on everything is awesome you found a very big positive out of this and you can interest and that's what I'm trying to do this is an opportunity for myself and try and use it as an opportunity to just carve out a little slice of the internet however big or small might be where we can affect some positive change and like an idea in your ideas and learning and free expression and free thought and making mistakes and disagreeing and all that I think it's all great I want to use this as an example I want to get away from the Orthodoxy of the gaming industry of stifling a strangling left-wing Progressive like no variations no room for debate why is that why I think it's it it portrayed it it's like it all gets funneled through a media that is that is hyper level right so it's it's similar in a way to the media in in news and politics these you know underneath the surface of the gaming industry are there plenty of conservatives and Libertarians they they hide they do a lot of them heads of Studios that feel the way I do I know people that are in the trenches at QA and doing like very menial things again soon as I feel the way I do everything between I remember to GDC game developer conference in San Francisco which Happens Every Spring six or seven years ago guy pulled me aside are speak out because they'll get lambasted in some way that would happen to me over something so innocuous will you push back about your ideas before this yes what what did you experience so every time I would write a politically-driven senior editor but I kind of had like editor-at-large quality meaning for be like 50000 word articles 15000 words there's a game that was cancelled maybe five years ago or so it was pretty late development so we're does cancel a game when they already spent too much money on it it was called six days in Fallujah and it was it was a third person shooter I think about the experience of Fallujah Iraq terrible conflict in there and people even on the right we're getting upset about it's too soon it's it's this is awesome this is so great that someone to tell a story like this evening and do something like that and you just get it from all sides people will be like you know it it's it's it's not sensitive it's it's it's is Jabra he made a mistake maybe exactly that's why I say like this was the moment the joke was the moment that they were looking to pounce really and I'm not saying that they were calculating everyone's waiting but they saw an opportunity and I took it because over time you lose respect over people where they remember that you said this group call me in an email now it's like I'm a Nazi I'm alright as long as I don't think I have one I think I've won all right all right means what is all right and I don't I don't know the image that you have alt-right characteristics you can see these four words that mean what about me 20 poster idea maybe 50 poster page and I was reading it and I heard some of it because people are like people telling me I said things I never said fish and blah blah blah I like counter nausea and he's a racist either so I think the soft races are soft bigots off trace of being like that he he doesn't he doesn't intentionally or actually over at least anything that supports causes that are racist or sexist feel and end things that I said or being taken out of context I often used in video games one of the big things is like you know there's a need for diverse casts the first protagonist some stuff like that and I often use the case that I used to use the saying I don't believe in diversity for diversity sake I believe that an artist should tell a story of an artist or writer and a game wants to have an all white cast and that's what he thinks took that out of context of her calling me a racist and a bigot and all these kinds of things and it's it's it's hurtful because there's no one there to make it worse so it was kind of like this hapless kind of situation I found myself in and I tried to make the best of it once about that with a friend who is an Asian actor and he was talking about the lack of roles for Asians in Hollywood and what a massive issue is and you know that he wanted to raise awareness of it I was like man but this is you were talking about a creative Venturi talk writing a story like I think the the correct way to go about it is try to figure out how to get your own project through or someone else who feels very strongly about this trying to get there on Project through but the right way is not for someone to have to compromise their Creative Vision in order to Encompass the full spectrum of races in whatever story their writing a creative story you want to write a story about a small town in Maine like Stephen King has done so often you shouldn't have to have 10% Asians in that story I mean that's not what creativity is about it's about a deer There Are Places and people and what you're going to run into all black folks or where you going to run into all Norwegian people I mean the dodo stores are just as valid as a story that's fully Devers you know I don't know I don't think that necessarily makes anything better and I also think that when you're talkin about that you're so you sort your sort of talking about it like there should be a quota you know and like in Hollywood should recognize the need for these people to be in films and movies and see you you're you're making this politically correct sort of passing these these judgments on this thing that is all about imagination I mean Hollywood essentially like what when you're making a television show or you making a movie is really about an imagination it's about imagination and vision and having that Vision being entertaining for people and if you like only want to write about the people that you were in college without you that you share a dorm room with you should be allowed to and if there's a disproportionate amount of people that are doing that happen to be white males that Nina we should probably try to figure out why but the idea that you have to force people to hire Asian folks or black folks or women or what teams are crazy to me project their Warsaw and it's based on diffusion of like polish kind of identity with this famous book series that they sound like kind of Polish War you know I kind of The Lord of the Rings but in Eastern Europe and 1 Guys cartoon character that works at this website called polygon review was talking about how there were no there was no diversity there nnn everyone's like Poland and it's based on one of your like and it's about dragons and like goblins and there's some white guys and this is like what you're upset about you know there's another guy making an Eddie Slovakia Kingdom Come deliverance and in this area in 15 I'm trying to make a game that's true to the era does that doesn't make him a racist and and these are the kinds of this is a kind of b******* like a black person in a game about Poland in the 1500 to whatever it was virtue signaling even knew what it meant until a few weeks ago around I didn't quite know what am I looking into it it's what it is we have to have black people in this game can in Disney be out but what they're saying when they when they when they're saying we have to have black people in this game in Eastern Europe in the 1500 what they're saying what they're really saying is you're racist</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> thank you so much pleasure is amazing will Dave Rubin recommends you listen to Dave room is a whole lot of people's recommendations but Dave rubin's one of them he's been an amazing figure my life is in the last lesson even a month and usually these kind of was like my savior when like everyone was kicking me while I was down he was the one that got to reach the hand out and so I owe him a great deal real simple joke James helium pull up the joke this is what happened Colin tweeted a joke about a day without a woman and everybody knows that a day would I want without a woman was like that day without a Mexican thing where you were supposed to like well imagine if there were no women well so yeah I would laugh everything was funny and I would move on and that's it so then go above that go above that above it send this tweet which was roundly condemned as sexist yet not really true if you leave the gaming industry but probably condemned in the gaming industry for sure outside of that people I mean normal everyday people that don't have an axe to grind about literally everything how did you know Reddit maybe Corona maybe laughing then kept going about their day like a normal person if you work for any kind of a company that is in any way public where you can be targeted where they can say all that's the f****** God go get them like anything that's remotely controversial and that is a really remotely controversial it's just Al Bundy put it up on some YouTube channel that's like that. Like my family forever ever I can't believe this this is so great by the way on Twitter stupid and she left yet she's at the ER nurse and she works the overnight shift so she was just getting in the padded as I was getting up and she's like gas when we didn't really think twice about it I sent that I got in the shower I went about my day and then when I got to work I realize I was a much bigger deal than I had thought and and it was and then everything fell apart and then we built very quickly so the straw that broke the camel's back for me yet why in the f*** man V I was just I I felt like how is it how is it possible that there's not a single man that would complain and if he did he's not a man I agree and I say also that if a person that wasn't a self-described like it also gotten a rash of s*** and been sort of I think maybe in a different maybe in a different place when not in the gaming industry which is almost completely hyper liberal so I've had a Target on my back for years and that's kind of the point that the lost on some people is that this was just an opportunity no one was offended by this joke no one was a gas like I said I have person study them in a lab but to me I was like no this is I mean it was Cruz clear a few hours later when I finally realized what's happening with this is there in for the kill now this is this is they found their way to get me and why do you think they wanted to get you because I was born and raised San Francisco and it is as cartoonishly liberal as everyone thinks it is so it's it's the gaming industry is there the gaming media right about the engine cover them in and do all that kind of stuff there but they're largely there and it's a huge Echo chamber they don't like when people penetrate the echo chamber and I made a name for myself and entry over years I was a senior editor of the biggest Gaming website in the world for years and there and I made a name for myself not only with criticism in with long-form pieces but but but basically it's in 2011 and 2012 people going after game developers this is an okay this character assassination a good example for everyone out there doesn't know games there's a game called Borderlands 2 and one of the developers was giving an interview about it he was back in 2011 he said something to the nature of this mode that particular mode in the game is accessible for everyone it's like a girlfriend mode if you want your girlfriend to come pet play this was like a he said by using the term girlfriend and I wrote this piece saying like what the hell is everyone doing this guy is trying to explain something he's not a sexist why do you make these assumptions based on this one thing about him and why do you want to ruin someone and that's the whole thing they want to ruin people so I was outspoken about this and I would have spoken for my support of Mitt Romney and all that book about my support for Johnson in my house so they don't like that they don't like that stuff and and and I think that's pretty clear now so you feel like there's a sort of a reinforced type of thinking like a very liberal reinforced type of thinking that you must subscribe to if you want to be a part of this yes it's an orthodox it's a complete and utter Orthodoxy and it's it's it's kind of nice about this like the unintended consequence that I think it's the silver lining of the Dark Cloud is people from the outside now saw firsthand like what I have been saying for a long time which was which was like I was kind of On The Fringe I was kind of being pushed out and I got that literally thousands of people tweeny I mean Facebook message this is f****** crazy these people really are out to get you based on that you know you would think I died I said some horrible just defensive just truly awful thing do you think they're really out to get you or do you think they're capitalizing on a moment where they feel like you have a Target on you and they like him he's down we got them and but this reaction culture that we have like this over over-reaction culture that we find herself in today it really does seem to Foster that kind of behavior that people really like it when someone gets caught doing something or what said something inappropriate when you can just point the finger and then everybody can pylon yeah I think you're probably right in a sense I never gain the benefit of the doubt Austin flag is my Twitter I kind of had that first since 2009 and flag being don't tread on me the snake then other people in the industry and I think that I definitely think of that tweets will make you very economical with your worst something really long tool for that but not if that's a little ridiculous that's cuz you only I don't know if that's the case how it is now but well actually it definitely is right like if I write to you if I reply to you your name takes up a big chunk of what I tweet right you but you what you tweet doesn't take up so it's like 240 characters would be limiting people that respond to you rather than you tweeted unless you're whatever they were images used to take up characters to and then in videos and links I think the links are the only thing left that takes up the extra characters in addition to the name but he keeps everyone Kurt she was waiting by the by the window to scold me for this and I like that what the hell is going on between out if you tweet about that just for posterity longer s*** hey that's a loophole don't do that don't do that all the time people like going in Photoshop make a paragraph of a text and then make that the image that you would take a picture of it yeah that's exactly mean in writing it's very difficult to me even if you're reading a book sometimes you have to go over the previous paragraph to figure out exactly how this guy was setting this up but I think what's it what's happening what you're saying I see there's two parts one before about the guy saying that it's like girlfriend mode if he just said it's like safe your girlfriend does video games and she wants a really easily accessible you can do it that way but I would say it's I'm going to die on that Hill because I feel like people deserve the benefit of the doubt people deserve to make a mistake or get a joke wrong are you know all those kinds of things and I feel like yes people are allowed to exercise their free speech on the other energy like I don't like that joke or I don't like this or I don't like that but it doesn't stop there with what's going on with Dave Chappelle this week was really actually interesting with his two specials on Netflix people are freaking out about me or his jokes has his jokes about gay people the amount saying that it's ridiculous comparison and or Daniel Tosh that's like where I am because I was reading a piece specifically about Chappelle weather like this close-up questions as to why I like how far should comedy go and people like it I understand what they're trying to do because when they live in that world of cubicles and human resources and very stricted patterns of behavior that you have to follow if you live in an office environment and work in an office environment rather you know there's a lot of people out there that are boxed into these terrible situation we have to pretend to be this thing that you're not and again you don't have any personality you. You're not allowed to say anything ridiculous or silly and when you you have that kind of environment and you see someone was free like Dave Chappelle you you want to stop it if you can if you can point something out that can look he's saying something that's in a pro you saying something I don't agree with you saying something let's get let's go get them and then also in defense of the writers that are writing his articles look there in a bizarre environment where they have to f****** constantly defend like their position they have to constantly get clicks this consoling get hits they did Canton put an article out nobody reads it they'll lose their job so they have to write about something that's inflammatory right about something that's salacious something's going to get excited I mean that guy that wrote that thing about you for the international business times I looked into that international business times in one of things about it is that there was a I think was a Mother Jones article about that website where they were told like that the people who write articles were given some ridiculous tasks like they have to get 10,000 hits per article there I'm right so that might have four people don't know there was a guy who wrote an article about Colin where it said kind of funny Colin Moriarty was mine's after writing a joke a racist joke the targeted women wasn't racist even remotely in the slightest but when you take into account the environment that these people forced to work in and you say well this guy literally is forced to write something that's more f***** up than it really is so you have to get people excited about this in a way that's going to get them to click on it and hopefully get him to his 10,000 hit quote if that is true I feel for him in a way he's worth shity business you know right but it's the same way I feel like I actually came from the editorial world we have to get clammy we get our expectations are way higher and you have those kind of requirements there are a couple of examples where I wouldn't write a story because I felt like it was important to any information and it was specifically to assassinate someone character to what I was actually interviewing her that she never would want the victim of sexism in Industry ever and that was and I was like I I could write this isn't why I was there I was interviewing about this problems and that's not who I am and people appreciating her work would not be celebrated have to be in some ways Target like why is that story at Target but wouldn't you assume that if there is a person who can reach a high-level prominence in in this very complicated business right when the gaming industry is incredibly complicated especially how weighted everything is when it comes to male versus female stuff that whole gamergate s*** expose so much which was really confusing people in the outside supposed to be like me you don't play game right I was like what the f*** are people involved in a sort of a dispute that makes that person appear to be a sex that you supposed to pylon piling on me remaining silent that got freelance work because of me that got maybe even got hired because of the hiring committee that put me a push for them to take out to lunch I know who you are whether or not they agree with what you said or agree with what you do but they know you're who you are and they know the severity of what people are saying and they don't say anything that really wounds person and that really f****** hurt do you think that what's going on in a lot of ways when people did not come to your defense is that what you're doing and in many ways is making a very complicated and nuanced perspective from person and you're in your stance you're kind of you're taking this this this path outside of the ideology and by doing so you sort of challenge a lot of the ways these people have been behaving for a long time and as soon as you do that they have to kind of reconsider these ideological boundaries they've set up in their own behavior and thinking and communication and that they don't want to do that and they didn't want to do that like to keep things rigid and simple and they also want to continue to progress in career and in order to do that you have to kind of like have this predetermined pattern that you follow I think simple is the keyword that use Simple because yes they can't there people out there that cannot comprehend how a person who believes in small government for instance will use the same argument that says that the government can't touch my guns that's consistent with saying the government can't tell them what to do with her body I don't want to be able to marry woman and I would go as far as to say that even as totally on the up-and-up everyone's in on a relationship should not be when they feel like it's the right that's not figure out how that might be is always been real real fasting, and now that you've left your company which was what was it called kind of fun out of it was kind of funny kind of funny was the four of us founded the company were all at IGN in different respects and I'll respond to just start our own YouTube channel about games and their culture and stuff like that do podcasts everybody but once that how could you not they turned on you over that stupid f****** joke stupid joke this impasse again so I was like let's just pull the Band-Aid off and get the kids over with are you going to do something involves politics now but clearly you have a deep passion for this new YouTube channel that April 3rd is called Colin's Last Stand thousand a month people are talking people are responding to this holy s*** that's not a f****** money 39 Grand a month somite my my expectations were blown out of the water and I really would I read it in the show is is is you know people are just sick of this b******* this is them this is them speaking and being like we need a conduit that's going to get into the history of the flossing the politics but also that will stand up and say like I'm not sorry for a joke people of the right to make mistakes people have the right to express themselves fly the flag on their door and pull it off and call in a race I'm just going to shake my head and walk away because there are other things to worry about people that like one more Liberty focused individual Focus kind of things and that's just people speaking to me you know</div>

Friends have been rocks just like when they tweeted out those so you find out this is what I say and all the Muslims at the airport then you find out why are they at the airport I'd be honored they were gassed by the lesser of two evils so there is the Silver Lining and it's finally starting to come out because the the Democrats have run this russiagate to that it's a good. They did the Mueller report it's over he concluded there is no collusion over so now they moved out to impeachment but now he's bombing so they're finally starting to talk about the War Powers Act Ukraine to investigate his political provide jobot aren't really that upset that makes sense because they think that he's not presidential because he debunked it like a good reporter supposed to do what he he always makes a point that Trump is not a suitable Steward of imperialism and they think he puts an ugly face on the ship we've been this is what I would Trump what's an ugly face on the stuff we've been doing all along so now people are going to be more aware of it and we would have been more aware of it if the Democrats would have actually opposed them on substance instead of Russia Gates he says things like when he when he was talking about back Daddy that he died like a dog and you'll like what are you allowed to say that I die like a dog or how about this is the weird thing that he uses Twitter to threaten other countries like we was talking about Iran that and if they respond they will we will respond it in / happening is proportionate manner you using Twitter to threaten nobody ever thought that there was going to be the sort of a venue for president to just just have mouth diarrhea and that's why they believe that's a big reason why a lot of the establishment wants to get rid of them because he makes them look bad because they agree with his policies that Democrats just gave him everything he wanted they pay for his f****** border wall they gave expanded spying Powers they gave him the Democrats just gave him everything he wanted they pay for his f****** border wall the game of expanded spying Powers they gave him a x231 billion to go bomb people's they help fast-track is judges they f****** also helped him deregulate walls through what the f*** aren't they doing for him and that's why we have Donald Trump</div>

Neil Riordan my saying that right yes sir and Mel Gibson how are you sir you know he was 92 and not any was doing all the old man stuff you know his hip was killing him and he was like he had he had multiple problems I mean I won't get into the whole Litany of complaints but hey you know your engine starts wearing out you got to replace the carburetor in a few other things I took him to the Mayo Clinic great place if I ever get into serious trouble that's where I'm going and they were fantastic there but they were able to say a early. Be dead in 48 hours of my vote so they they clocked every problem that he had everything from you know the prostate to the to the hip to the kidneys to the heart to the lungs you know the whole deal and he stabilized medical procedures all allowed which country and they were great but you know I still had reservations about him getting hip replacement cuz he was old and of course just the recovery from a traumatic surgery at that age is like it's a big deal and I thought what can I do with my brother adult stem cells Hannibal Lecter assholes or something but I was like okay we'll look into it so we did and of course A buddy of mine who was that who is a Mayo doc he should stay away from those which doctors down in Panama he said it's like leprosy and banana boats and three legged dogs you know when am I going to come we call him and so so Brad and I got on the phone to Neil and who else was it so they're talkin highfalutin terms medical all day medical as you know they sort of they know what a mesenchymal stem cell are mesenchymal how do you say it you know so when we hang up translate what does all that mean he's like he translated a few things he's pretty good you know I think we called you right back and we spend another hour on the phone and look at it but it was all relevant to what had and you know for the heart heart problems and kidney problem orthopedic problems and he read all the Articles any red. The upside the downside and and and then then we had it to his credit then we had a very educated talk at conversation yeah they took him into the hospital he was 92 and they said what medications are you on these said I'm not an Indian they said you're 92 years old how do you account for not being on any medications is because I stay away from doctors and hospitals have a rough trip right now they're clinical trials gone in the US but it's not broadly available and in Panama they passed a law in 2004 which allowed us and allow doctors actually to go down there to be able to treat people with using adult stem cell so the bill was actually designed to prohibit the use of embryonic stem cells and in this at the in the same law they said it's okay to use adult stem cells including those from umbilical cord basically from ethical sources and sew in Panama date gave us we have a license from the Ministry of Health to manufacture and use those cells in addition to doing clinical trials there so it's it's one place on the planet where you can get really high-quality umbilical cord these this type of cell the two major kind of stem cells mainly work with and finding us on the internet and they go and then they brought him down to get to take him because the last thing you want is Mel did Mel Gibson's dad to drop that in your clinic come down there privately then we we did some IVs on in first in the clinic and then to do the hip we need to do that so we give the umbilical cord these are these are isolated from the the basically the the meat of the umbilical cord there I slide then they're grown our laboratory which is you know ISO 9001 and very high quality certified by Ministry of Health they're grown in the laboratory and their certified to be in a free of everything and in-kind infectious disease and and clean rooms and to make it put on like hats and gloves if you feel like all Frankenstein doubt you walk of these cold rooms and you're watching cells divide under the microscope is kind of miraculous really look at this and normally what they do is they they modulate your immune system they decrease inflammation and they stimulate regeneration so and the good thing about them is they tend to home to areas where there is information so intravenously they do a lot of things and but they can home to areas of inflammation and and they they really reduce inflammation in the body because they upregulate part of your immune system that that controls the inflammatory process so I can talk more about it later but in his case you know his kidneys were in trouble his heart was in trouble and the cells date they don't unlike what we used to think in the early days they don't become anything these kind of this kind of stem cell does not come become anything in your body but it home stereos of that need repair and it secretes things that stimulates the repair and decrease the inflammation and helps out with the immune system so what we treat are autoimmune diseases and miv so that that he could basically have these things on board secreting the secretion of cytokines in the in the growth factors that are normally secreted and when you're 92 and you have multi organ failure you're basically Running on Fumes and so you put these days gyro young healthy cells and they secrete these things that kind of restarts everything and so what was his response to this IV treatment wax lyrical about that he's almost a hundred years old and from pretty bad shape it was like bee stings it was like you got a new lease of life like you got a big dose locally in the hip Woodshop fixed all his inflammation and pain and he start walking again and his kidneys were good and his heart that he had a prolapsed Valves and there and they healed and his cognitive Powers improved his eyesight improved you know and other stuff improve that I he would hate me to talk about but he had two nurses that reported to me it was like holy mackerel back injuries and neck fusions and he said he got intravenous stem cells the way he described his life with his Dutch acted like it was like I have lightning coming out of my finger injuries and neck fusions and he said he got intravenous stem cells the way he described his life with his Dutch acted like it was like I have lightning coming out of my finger</div>

Finally the muscle Memories Back and I'm at a new camp it's great for my style train with Rafael Lovato Jr maybe the best American Grappler for BJJ was accomplished maybe he's fantastic. Oklahoma City how f****** convenient absolutely so now the Best of Both Worlds my two passions right there that's not the other guy I've ever felt claustrophobic yes I'll o'shaughnesy the whole that whole family of the style of Jiu-Jitsu so powerful man both of them no treatment with solo and then Shawn G was there in our corner so is pretty awesome for a Bellator fight and I was yesterday I was kind of bummed out well but he's been he's an animal honestly he's one of those guys that is so well-rounded and you think he's just one-dimensional because of everything is done in Jiu-Jitsu but he grew up kickboxing I don't yet dad's been a lifelong martial artist senior he's an incredible guy and he's been taking Rafael all around the world since he was a little boy having trained mixed martial arts not just Jiu Jitsu is a life Salvatore's making some moves man you know they're doing mitrione vs Fedor and they're going to Lorenz Larkin just sign with them Roy McDonald sign with them that's a stable now they have a legit at Lima how to pull out because it was kidney stone and then they're going to schedule Taughannock apparently but I think I think this car there their stacking it pretty heavily has been going down into andales a fight apparently apparently you're fighting he sent me a meme of something like let's train easy and vandalizing like yeah train easy but it's that picture of him in a private or something or maybe train were jumping in the air and just coming down with a big hammer Fist and you land on you with his feet yeah that's a light day he's kind of known for that being a barbarian 24/7 I flash back right away to do you remember whenever Stefan struve had to pull out of his fight with mitrione backstage and yeah yeah yeah but already taped up had his gloves on was hitting mitts and then there were some of the behind-the-scenes cameras that caught a moment where I believe was Danny coming back there telling the fight was cancelled and mitrione just was you know Dustin up a storm no way not at all no but then I'll send you saw shiftwear Ellison he was worried about Stephen and he walk down there went backstage or to his locker room and Mandy just hug them and Stephen was sobbing and Matt mitrione just like you hey it's alright bro I know if you could fight you would have and all the other stuff and so I guess he had passed at least one or two kidney stones to fight week couple days before weigh-ins and then the day of the fight they just aren't coming back out I think he had something 20 photo so man I know all the ladies out there you are your lot tougher than us giving birth but I hear this is the equivalent you know for the men is I doubt any stone I doubt it that's be like more like a passing a marble I call you know I doubt it has to be like more like a passing a marble that's a call you know</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> I don't know but I feel like memory when you told me that story about the monkey that you had that you had when you were on Fear Factor set of Newsradio like way back in the day was supposed to be in some stuff that I tell you this I probably said it before this little motherfuker was on my back and he hit me a couple times and I was stunned I was like oh no this is not what I thought it was a little person buy a full grown chimp okay well that's my argument with the Silverback vs Grizzly you said Grizzly because grizz's your motherfuking badass than a champ grizzly grizzly can't like there's no way that you can outrun a Grizzly there's no way in hell I don't know what is a Silverback full speed by the band Grizzly can outrun it's whatever what's the gorillas and I think a Grizzly can outrun a champ and I cry for me I think there's no way the gorillas getting f***** he's getting them telling you right now big ass interior know what your hands feel like when they Shake mine so I would be I guess I'm not like a Grizzly butt top speed that was it feels like 25 milk is dude I'd but I'm wiry it's actually a Wapiti Wapiti what is that it was that name come 5 heard it school named Wapiti Wednesday is a hashtag cammie's is a lot Wednesday told you so guess what I'm thinking it's just like an archery argument but there's not much of a difference in the speed it's real close and a grizzly bear is so much bigger moving so much more mass around like of a big Grizzly is 500 lb I'm pretty sure what is a big 190 is that not a mountain your name is like not the biggest one she's weird like brown bear sounds like by so cuddly and yeah Nature Made Them cool to look at so we don't mind as much that they're murderers I would argue Disney right like that Bambi movie that's a lot of people of a Silverback versus a grizzly about grizzly bears and brown bears that were listening yeah they were there they're pumped I think that they're all dangerous and ferocious and Lincoln Silverback versus the nigras you think you would win podcast what we need to know what people want to know I wouldn't want to fight a 38 lb rat ratman you should have said 3048 how much you can get it no way if you're not wearing welding gloves talk to you about Garfield you're talking like I don't know let's talk about a Conor McGregor Garfield at coming in at 10 like a real good tiger-cat like when you know it was those ones like real common house cat ones to look like a little picture this pic if you grabbed 10 lb mountain lion and he he's home outline and he saw a mountain lion when they was walking his dogs get these little cutie dogs is walking a little cutie dogs and he saw this f****** thing so its tail and picked it up pick the dogs up and then ran back to his house and then website website and found out that that they attract this animal and that it had a collar on it and the tracked it and it got hit by a car on the 5 and he's explaining like how the whole thing went down I was like well like you were walking your dogs in this big-ass lb + Cat so the actual cat that had a collar he knew because he died and when he found out the cat died he went and the sound of whiskey Ebro could bullying me sorry to my instinct super primate right the most super super but a bear is super super freak Predator animal freak out there Mount bear I just size of a 9 Pound rat was trying to kill you you would be freaking the f*** out who's running in your eyes like a little tiny bear you'd be f****** terrified of think of a giant one and realize help you you are totally defenseless and I don't think it's going to be that much difference for gorilla nearly think of a Silverback Gorilla with the way they're built and they swing around I think you'd be stood on the chest of a Grizzly could grab its paws and literally rip its arms out and beat it with it wow that's King Kong was a good movie I agree with you there I enjoyed it as much as I don't think they're that Grizzly hit a moose and can you told me that you saw it with your own eyes right is there any solid information of strength of a Silverback there's not the Silverback definitely can't grab his hard cuz doesn't have thumbs like we talked about but I think yeah but that's relative to a beating right how many fighters have a big ass and a lot of like leg power Cro Cop vs someone that's just sheer Grill up top let's do go there I just wonder dog giant dog crazy is equivalent to a giant dog a bear has a bear a bear</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> just talking about the the Air Force admitting that their pilots had seen UFOs and you were telling me you interviewed one of those interviewed commander fravor and he was saying that this the chocolate is Big my favorite figure out what the f*** something is but the monitor this thing they saw it with their eyes they saw it with their equipment it was actively jamming the radar whatever this thing wasn't shaped like a Tic Tac and it moves so fast you couldn't track with the human eye they said it went from I think they said some someone possible number like 60,000 feet down at 200 feet in less than a second like whatever you could try you know a radar as a blip blip blip they don't know how fast it actually went they just know it went this insane distance in less than a second less than a radar jump thank you and it would had observe them in that area without his knowledge like the other Air Force pilot observe them and then had brought it up the top of the food chain but it wasn't something that got distributed to everybody until he saw it when he saw he was like what in the f*** am I looking at here and they like we are we've been seeing these things and this thing was no active propulsion system you could recognize there's nothing around no fire coming out of it nothing around and it would just just disappear to so you take off an insane racing speed and actively jamming the radar so when I covered this on my show I said now I've heard reports that pilot see this stuff all the time but they never confirmed it and my question was why now why would the Air Force be confirming that they saw UFOs I'm not saying it didn't happen I'm saying why are they admitting it at but now and then of course you see in this last dog defense budget they put in money for space for therefore so do we don't acknowledge that application for expanding their reach or expanding their budgets they come up with some threats did I can put it together all we're going to admit that we have UFOs and now we're going to have a space by okay I can put that together that's the whole thing is like if I can do this I know they can do this they're just not doing it I think the UFO thing is you know I know you're probably right in terms of like one of the reasons why they released it but I think there's also this when you get a bunch of like really credible people like that Commander fravor guy when you get actual data like radar your you actually can look at video of the infrared infrared camera of the tracking that thing is enough for those now that people are like what the f*** is going on and if you guys have all this money and all this equipment is this is this something that the Chinese are doing or the Russians are doing or is this something you can explain and I think we're in this area where there's so much information people can get a hold of so many videos and so much stuff that they kind of have to start talking about it now okay conversations around the most innocuous of inquiries so they can shame pretty hard but when you got a guy who's like a decorated pilot like fravor and he's like look other crazy stories in my past he's not crazy guy rock-solid General all-around American hero type guy he's like look I'll tell you what I saw and it's pretty crazy when you got a guy who's like a decorated pilot like forever and he's like look the other crazy stories in my past he's not crazy guy Rock Solid General all-around American hero type guy is like look I'll tell you what I f****** saw and it's pretty crazy</div>

Charlamagne Tha God calls Elizabeth Warren the original Rachel dolezal that's right that's right choose Native American reason why when she's just saying this because our family but you were saying she's Native American that's the whole thing you're a 100% that don't know what she was right I know it's it's really come back to bite her in the ass I know I bet you she's created a fake pass and she did it back when there was no DNA test available so you can get away with being Native American and makes you look like your first of all kind of cool right everybody like ever see that movie Vision Quest no great movies Matthew Modine his buddies are a fake Indian is but he lied about being Native American had a mohawk and everything he's playing up the Native American thing cuz people want to be Native American it's a cool day to be more spiritual and it's certainly more oppressed so if you say that if she says she's Native American doll look at this native animated all the way to be present meanwhile she's like like 1 mm Native American is that what it was some ridiculous ridiculously small number right what you got a DNA test Trump said that you if she was Native American that he would give $1000000 of Charity give her a million-dollar some of that and she was like what what time to pay up like what did you look in the numbers yes she did yes she did everything you're saying right now sexist and I hope you know that everything you're saying is independent like how why is he allowed to tell the truth about war at Fox News I don't f****** get that they're not allowed to tell the truth about war at CNN or MSNBC will Shepard Smith was allowed to tell the truth to but he was but he was Australia's what's his name oh whoever that guy is he's fantastic in bought what business. John discount bombshell though niwrc nonprofit working to protect native women from violence more than half of all Native women have experienced sexual violence in the majority of violent crimes against Native Americans are perpetrated by non-natives send them your $1000000 check realdonaldtrump so she was saying that because she's Native American she tested like a trace amount like it really it's probably like she blew a Native American guy in college but when it is by the way it real Donald Trump I remember seeing on 75 you give me 1 million Cherry if I twist my DNA show Native American ancestry I remember and here's the verdict Warren test Warren reveals test confirming ancestry but it's such an insanely small amount I am 1.6% African I am 200 times more that's real yeah LOL so imagine I mean I thought that when she said she got fired from teaching and then video came out said she quit I thought that would be the end that should be the into I got called a sexist shut the fuel door so lucky you're not in jail with Jeffrey Epstein is not a lot of times he was a good guy that a nice yet we flew around with all the sky looked at things you had a couple drinks it's alright</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> busted that's kind of like the mission of my show is to remind people how we got Trump people want to pretend that corruption in lying started in January 2017 the Afghanistan papers just came out jokes that revealed that three administrations in a role I'd completely one-hundred-percent about Afghanistan from the day they took over to the daylight left stuff like Donald Rumsfeld saying we don't even know who the bad guys are really think that maybe we would go to war from mineral resources upset at what a small story it was those papers came out and then no one really even talked about it barely got it government including Barack Obama Afghanistan papers proved that they've been lot we've been lied to forever with the papers earn some people just don't happen when they did a study just like the Pentagon papers right they do their own study that reveals that they're lying so they interviewed 400 people that were like in the middle of generals in the military and contractors and all these kind of people to find out so they can know what will happen in Afghanistan so they revealed all this the people who they were interviewing we be allowed this that at the beginning of the board so who that that they still don't know who's the bad guys who were killing their lying about stay would lie that is going well and then their personal writings would be revealing that they didn't know what the hell they were doing and so it was what's worse than you think but we can still just keep sending four billion dollars a month they're just keep sending it just keep sending it for what no one knows we're not leaving Trump didn't take us out it's going to get these are up for re-election a couple of months we're still in Afghanistan he didn't do what he said he was going to do nobody does the problem and that's why we got Trump in the first place because Barack Obama comes in as an anti-war guy immediately get throwed by the military-industrial complex just like Trump did I believe that I did believe that Trump his brothers would get the hell out of the Middle East rights but he doesn't really have any druthers he's like okay I'm done doing that cuz they rolled me hard enough three years of russiagate I'm going to do what they want will you saw the conversation that he had with one reporter we talked about the military-industrial complex in about how they want to go to war actively while in office this is like like at Eisenhower thing like as he's leaving while in office talking about the military barely got mentioned I know and so I so I think that's why the establishment wants to get rid of trump even though he does their bidding and gives them their trillion dollar tax cuts nobody asked how we're going to pay for it he gives them into Venezuela he tried to try to do what he's doing here and he didn't come out we didn't get out of Syria what was that exact opposite of what he ran on his happening so why do why do I why do I think this happens because just what Eisenhower said is he left he says we the undue influence of the military-industrial complex and she mentioned they just invented 131 billion dollars more worth of work for Raytheon and Boeing and Halliburton how much money does the recording music business make a year Trump got elected 131 extra billion and we just think what you could do with that you can build 131 Yankee Stadium's do you hear do you think that a lot of this impeachment stuff and a lot of Scandal stuff is really a distraction for a lot of these things they're pushing through yes it's 100% distraction and if they really believe that they don't try to put handcuffs on them so that's how you know they're full of s*** and the reason why they're coming at Trump in the way this does waste so now they're starting to oppose them because of this Duran thing so now you turn on CNN Chris Cuomo goes to pay why doesn't Congress do its job and take back to war powers that they gave it to the president under which is what I predicted that the Democrats Republicans or fracking Arctic Drilling and all that stuff gassing immigrants at the border now we're all going to become aware of it well the Democrats been 3 years doing freaking Russia gate so they didn't ever oppose them on that stuff and they let him keep doing it and so now people are starting to become aware of what's happening and so now Chris Cuomo's going hey why don't why don't we I'm spying Powers you f****** bullshiter they're all f****** bullshitters it's weird scam would you give him an extra hundred 31 billion dollars to go bomb anybody at is open give me a hard time about supporting Tulsi rights like why you so I think it's really important to have an anti-war voice that has you know speaks from experience she's actually in the military right now she actually volunteered to go serve in their legal Wars and then they smear for it it's kind of amazing</div>

That's it well that's crazy it is 95 + percent of the population of Planet needs me I just happen to kill my own yeah that's it so it's not like 95% the populations right-wing cuz he killed her own food has a lot of right-wing like family values and things like that that I admire I think but when it when you can't when he gets to homophobia when he gets the women's rights that's where I break right 100% in favor of women's rights 100% in favor of gay rights gay marriage I'm a big proponent of there's got to be some new action taken to clean up a lot of these crime-ridden communities and the idea that we can spend all this money overseas we can't spend money on Flint Michigan or Detroit or the southside of Chicago that's amazing saying that doesn't make any sense and this idea that we're all in the same starting page is so f****** stupid to that that is a very non clean way of looking at it cuz everybody's like you got to pull yourself up by your bootstraps is a lot of people that came out of bad neighborhoods but they didn't didn't f****** cry woe is me to drive out there and they kicked ass that's nonsense you have no idea what it's like to grow up in a crime-ridden poverty infested drug-addled neighborhood you don't know what that's like and we should make it so that no one knows what that's why if we want America better the best way to start is to clean up all the spots that sucked and make people that are coming out of their have a real chance making something out of their life don't don't have it so that they're starting out from the time they're a child with a massive deficit that to me and what you mean by Clint's cleaning up the play mean Community programs putting money into these communities jobs jobs that's a big part of it protect them from The Gangsta put more cops in those neighborhoods and have them there all the time make them a part of the community they got to do something about the violence something about the gangs in this repetitive cycle of people growing up in these neighborhoods and getting trapped in the same horrible conditions of their parents to the grandparents did and it's an endless cycle we and we pretend like we don't have the resources to fix these Jack TR did I'll give you a job that means you're going to go work your earning it and get the money for it when that be amazing if they did that there could be strategy not all work I don't feel like I don't want anything to do with Enterprise zones all the problems of the community has jobs as something to look forward truth they need to know that they can if they do play by the rules they will get things you can have a job right now though people don't have any health care Blackman's either we're talking about the coal mining communities in West Virginia man who you don't even like I have a good friend is from there's like man you don't know what poverty is like you don't even know a party is like until you see that nothing I talked to a guy on my shows name is Nick Smith from Virginia and he told me he was Waffle House cook and he told me and I thought I might even told you this before you said hey we all knew that Donald Trump was a loudmouth Yankee but Hillary Clinton police offering us something so they're desperate people need something she won't even sign on to a $15 minimum wage when she was with you when she came around with gay-marriage my family lived we live in San Francisco in the height of the I mean it was the vietnam.war there's always hippies hippie I mean I've been liberal my hold up I just look like a Republican what do I like my friend Graham Elwood is do you know him he's and he's very anti-war like me and so these people were bucking with him to be pro-war and he's like that's right I'll knock you out</div>

When he left the presidency he goes windsurfing with Branson for a while right as we still don't have clean water in Flint and comes back in the public is this a bribe what do you not for the fact yes but it's amazing that they still honor that that they're they're so rock solid in their commitment to this corrupt system that even after the guy can't even help him anymore is out-of-office they hook him up with these speaking jobs where he gets a half a million bucks a pop and then whatever you want to do Bill Clinton would he would make sure that he got speaking gigs along did the weapons deals that you're giving yes this is Chris he didn't get drunk because the Democratic party was doing their job the people were got desperate and decided to take a chance on a political novice game show host who they knew was a bullshiter everybody knows I don't know because I communicate an acrostic with you but I've been trying to burnish his should be wiping the floor with these candidates hit that shouldn't even be closed right and so I've been employing them Bernie take the gloves off would you quit turning to Joe Biden and saying my best friend Joe Biden you got to do what Trump did what Trump was running he ran against the Republican Party ran against all those puke set the people are sick and tired of the people have been let down by these are the people who took you to a wrap these are the people who took you to live yet these are the people who are bankrupting you these are the pics so that's what he did and he do Bernie gets up and go drop my good friend I just want to let you know you're corrupt it's like quit saying you're friends with find the reason why you can't understand how medicare-for-all works is because you're corrupt and your pay not understand and we're going to get rid of your brand of corruption when I'm president has you're the problem oh my God what the game is wasn't he always in support of her Joe Biden yeah no no no no no yeah there was always in support of Elizabeth Warren was like a Bernese policies are pretty popper out for 10</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> what is play when time was written by Steve Martin and it was a fictitious meaning between Picasso and Einstein and a bar in France was called Picasso at the Lapin agile and in it Picasso's painting and he's talking and he says an artist must stay well f***** otherwise his eye goes from the page to the windowsill down to the street across over to the cafe with a girl sitting with her skirt up and and it's like you got that's what stuck with me is Bernard it doesn't stay well f*** that I was going to do anything about getting laid Yeah men will understand that but men will rarely say that in the presence of women and so because of that women either don't believe it or they dismiss it or they think you're a pig for expressing it right all those things but men alone. That makes sense I give you say that otherwise you get distracted this dude is true women have no idea I heard a thing on NPR one time probably 15 years ago and they were doing a story about this woman who decided to transition to be a man and so she documented it and do like an audio thing and she talked about how when she was into and started feeling her testosterone and she would become attracted to women and she goes it didn't have to be a boob it could be in elbow it could be your ankle it can be whatever and I would and she goes I finally understood boys yeah yeah pretty f****** distracting isn't it you got to keep your s*** together well it's not just that it's a biological imperative it's a reason why people breed right like that's built into the DNA to make people attracted to females so they can spread their DNA and that's what it is it's that simple to deny that is crazy but you've got men denying it because they want women to like them and then you got women dismissing it because they they think that the man who express it in an honest way are pigs and sexist and they exhibit toxic masculinity which is that's a hilarious expression cuz you need to thank toxic masculinity for all the bridges all the f****** all the Jets all the Rockets what is toxic masculinity you break down all the things that men have invented and all these toxic men have prevented but like you from being murdered in war and protected the car Korean all the all the different things that you could attributed toxic masculinity most of its positive women who developed a terrible way most likely with bad parents most likely abused physical and or sexual and then they become a monster at the end of all this process is the same with men bad men are just bad human beings that happen to be men and when you see terrible things happen it's not because of toxic masculinity a bad person I believe in the individual there's individuals and some of them are bad and some of them are good but you want if you just want to generalize against all men like your urine Coppell road is too many obviously not me I've never felt anything but there's too many things that men have done their positive there's way too many this to me that if you wanted to have like a scoreboard and you wanted to compete men vs women will why what are you going to say when you look at all the different accomplishments that men have made and obviously it's not me it's not you I'm not talking about us like what they were on a team but I'm playing like just this ugliest concept that men are bad you hear this a lot today socially white man I don't hear from White matte okay well that's crazy cuz there's a lot of nice white men but this is dumb dumb. Of you yeah he's one of them idea that you can generalize about one entire group with his by gender or whether it's by race but by anything but you can do that with white men you can't really do that with brown women you can't say he has a problem with black women you know all black women of this that people who you're a racist piece of s*** you say here's a problem both are gross both statements are generalizations are disgusting whether there a gender-based generalization or a sex-based general but whenever it is so they would say that that's okay to say that about white men because of the power dynamic more power sure but they also have more power than white man it's a tiny percentage of white men who have the power they were talking about when you talk about CEOs and you're talking about you know judges or what is it yes yes white men are in those positions to talk but they're also in those positions of power over most white men like it's it's not it's it's a very small amount of people that have extraordinary amount of influence yeah they happen to be white man police white men suck look at this I know that's the smallest percentage of people who are these billionaires who are these CEOs who are these judges who are these people that are in positions of power that happen to be white men so have you ever now again I don't know I heard a guy refer to himself like a regular guy refer to himself as a cyst male get your mail if you are trans woman and you you want to be referred to only as a woman that fine no problem with that but I'm not going to call myself a cyst male that's some new made up s*** that sounds like you're calling to shame people into using that Ram it down their throats eventually they'll accept it and it'll become normal and that you have to cuz if they want to refer to us as trans we have to refer to them as says we have to force them to make a clear distinction so instead of making it look like a trans woman is lesser you sent you instead of that you have cisgender and transgender there because you're you're adding to that name that prefix because you're adding to both now now you've equalize the playing field you level the playing field with the problem with that is trans is extremely rare it's the reason why you have that prefix in the first place cuz it's really really unusual to meet a trans woman despite how the internet would have you feel I was always a tough life to be a transgender what to dress up like Meghan McCain and just start going on rants on your shout you'd be free I would have such a f****** free pass I mean like Caitlyn Jenner kill the lady don't even talk about anything I just slammed not paying attention rear-ended her and oncoming traffic she's dead now and no one even brings it up everyone's like a brave you think she's intact her she cut it off you think she's intact her she cut it off oh my God it's a con yeah I don't but that was accident it wasn't like it was a careless accident still she rear-ended somebody and slandering oncoming traffic OK and whether or not she was on her phone I don't know</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> you think that you could do Tropic Thunder today would that be possible or you could do it in again like Eddie you know I look back to me that movie to me was a circle back to my dad's movie called Putney Swope which I highly recommend anyone who hasn't seen to see about a black guy who takes over an ad agency in the 60s cuz everyone votes for him when the head of the company. because they think no one else will and it's about what happens when someone who is free-spirited takes over and essentially corrupt and ever and then he realizes and confronts his own corruption but I remember I was probably two or three when that was being shot and when it came out and it was so a part of my upbringing and I just remembered some of those the folks that were around my dad at that time and so when band called and said hey I'm doing this thing and you know I think penne pasta possibly wisely and I thought yeah I'll do that and I'll do that after Iron Man and my heart is a I get to I get to be black for a summer in my mind so there's something in it for me the other thing is I get to hold up to Nature the insane self-involved hypocrisy of artists and what they think they're allowed to do on occasion just my opinion and also been who is a masterful artist and director probably the closest thing to a Charlie Chaplin that I've experienced it might have the time he writes he directs he acts he if you would seen him when he was directing this movie you would have been like I'm watching I'd lean I'm watching Chaplin I'm watching Coppola he he knew exactly what the vision for this was he executed it it was impossible to not have it be an offencive nightmare of a movie and 90% of my black friends are like dude that's great but I know where my heart was it's never an excuse to do something that is out of place and not if it's time but to me it was just putting a it was a blasting cap on and by the way I think White Chicks came out pretty soon after that I was like I love that I like that was great the prime minister of Canada cuz he did brownface pretended to be Saudi Arabian Arabian Nights in high school or something like that it's it's an interesting and necessary meditation on where is the pendulum why is the pendulum right where's the pendulum maybe cutting little into what could be perceived as as heart in the right place openness of its time I mean you know there's some morality Clause here on this planet and it's a big price to pay and I think having a moral psychology is his job one so sometimes you just got to go yeah you know I act up again not in my defense but Tropic Thunder was about how wrong that is so I take exception I think you could do it today I think you could I think it could be done today it would be so much outrage but it would also be people cheering and if you if we got we boiled down all the b******* and got to the actual result of what the film did the f****** hilarious to this. I watched it again about a year-and-a-half ago it's a great movie it's a great fun movie I mean it's ridiculous over-the-top Arias and it worked then and your portrayal and it wasn't it wasn't egregious it wasn't it was it was necessary it made sense all of it fit it all the square pegs in square holes I just thinking I think I drove by was it might be the last time we'll ever see a studio take a chance on a guy wearing black face and the the prolific use the word retard those are two things and by the way that's what I've been the funny thing to was all the heat got deflected to Ben and simple Jack that's what people were pissed off about and I go but you never know when it's going to be and I've been on both sides of the coin sometimes life just says your symbol now did you have anybody that was telling him not to do it with her but the agents or anyone was in my mother was horrified how are you sweating just been a couple times I was all the night before and we're on Kauai and here we go and I was just running I think I had six lines that day but I knew that there was going to be Choppers it was going to be a squib fire there was going to be choreography there was going to be you know it was going to be cacophonous and the only thing that mattered to me again what my actions and actor in this movies to know what I'm doing even if what I'm doing is insane so I ran those six or eight lines I had sometimes lying in bed over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again so the next day I was free to enjoy myself and not be struggling to wonder what it was I was supposed to be doing and then that's what it is it was just you know it was one little Mosaic after the next and by the end of it I had some cried that day I'd made it through forget that it wasn't you know blackface it was a special effects makeup day after day after day after day after day after day after day except for the times when I would have my bleached hair and blue contacts in my eyes or if you know other characters and it was just a it was a piece of work I was doing and I cared about doing this professionally and it's on is a kid so when you memorize lines that's an interesting thing you said that you were free to to do it like when you memorize wants is there ever a part like when you're acting where you have to think like what am I supposed to say next and how much is that get in the way there's I would look I have are very Broadband of of tolerances I don't care if the people I'm with happened to not know what they're doing or don't know and you're stepping on my lines or or whatever or want to change their lines and my lines and it's always a different thing it's like reading the room it's like you know if I was a fighter you on the octagon and daddy to go you ready you ready and you go and then you just do it but so I've had it where I would try to be off book before everyone else I would get it down to an acronym so if there was a thousand words I do remember I would just remember the first letter of each and I would put it on a piece of poster board and then I would stand away from it not as far as you and your your archery set up over there but far enough away to where I can see if I kind of can't see it back when my vision was little more clear and I would just run it run it run it when it did the first Sherlock we were rewriting it so much and I would have pages and pages of stuff as a human hair wig and it helped me with my accent and then I started getting into like you know what's so great I can finish work go home my kids are do whatever I want to do GO train and in the morning they can change it all they want I don't have to trip if it all if you know it unless it's some monologue that you want to really be committed to that's not going to shift I'm just go like that so you can put one of those lines and now I've kind of gone as far as you can go with that and I'll probably go back to the new method or a new version of the old method with whatever preparation going to do for each roll how you going to do it whether you're going to go and memorize everything obsessively or whether you just going to be a little bit more Lucy free with it yes depends on the script to like Tropic Thunder Justin Theroux wrote that script with the with Ben is really good script I mean my misses who next my mother was more so I was really waiting on in the kitchen it's so true if you do this right you're you're doing something that's it's about a bunch of self-involved idiots somehow or other becoming Eros it's cuz I love that if that's what it stays and it's going to be good in so like for instance the you know never go full throttle. smoking dope I'm not doing a mask I'm going to do everything right all right alright drop 6-1 up 9:52</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> this concept of things just sort of falling in the place I'm a big believer in that to what is that that was that you getting out of your own way like what what is that is it isn't that 70% of it yeah yeah I say it's 70% maintenance of what can I do to do my part to stay out of the way and then the other part I always think of it is like this little super-thin Invisible Thread you can feel the tug and you just kind of have to be really gentle when you have to pause when agitated and you have to go for it when you going to like it has four walls and hear which one has the math behind that you was that one and you knocked down the lawn it's there you know made a career out of sort of like labeling in aligning it or teach you how to get to it in Gray cuz it's the commodity that you can't capitalize on and yet if you don't show proof of its existence you you can't even you shouldn't even be qualified to speak on it I don't know but when it happens it happens with love or with friendship or with a career with a path you're taking you just to know while you're just a smile there's a smile like this is that I found it is that this is I'm supposed to be doing this here we go here we go at this point in my life and being you know kind of middle-aged and all that well I know I'm going to fly around the world and Michelle some soap and I know I have a new project and I know I just retired my jersey on this 12-year Journey I've been on and and how do I want to start and it came up how would you like it have The Joe Rogan Experience and and kick off this year in this season in this new chapter by doing what I love which is an interview as we're looking at each other and if there's a given take but to answer the question it can be anticlimactic like anything I mean this is so real you know I never seen you around a little bit but I feel like I know you cuz I see you all the time and I listen to you and I'm a I'm a martial arts nut and yeah isn't it sometimes when you when you get outside of the fortunate interesting creative experience you're having you kind of go like it's very dreamlike yeah yeah Phil Hartman was stunned that I was actually like sitting at we were at at this table read sitting across from a famous guy to be normal and then after awhile if that becomes normal and then the the fact that it becomes normally comes to real and then if we feels like a dream when I meet people like you like we've just met an hour or so ago and yet instantly I feel like I know you Dad very strange it's pretty easy to get to know them you say something I say something back of eye I know how he works I see what's going on in their actual human has to because you're so pretty in your show you literally you just use is a rolling start with you every time you coming to the show and you're already kind of thinking about stuff so it's it feels very organic and part of me even this morning was like I hope he looks into my eyes and doesn't see a complete and utter foolish frog because I would probably believe him if he beer that back to me when in just being myself someone who I respect you guys look amazing what it what are we talking about and you remember that cuz it kind of person is like I don't know what the next word out of my mouth is going to be right now no one ever does unless you do and if you do is kind of weird some people are poker players I respect some people that are because there's a an ability to maybe it's fear-based but I always appreciate people who knows people like their icons are big shots or that they hold a certain Steam and all of their texts are very simple it's like yes yes we should fix that sure on it how to make a. Beats the all-caps text yet I don't like those at all those people weird CT Fletcher but yeah The Surreal part is I think part of the reason I'm still so interested not just in life but also you know getting to do what I do is I'm a fan I love movies creativity I love music I love I love culture and the fact that I actually have a place in it while I'm observing it and digging it is like it's it's it's not her well that's a beautiful perspective and that shows in how you how you how you carry yourself and it shows in the work that you do that you do appreciate it and you know one of the saddest things is someone was in an amazing position who doesn't appreciate it and that that that drives other people crazy to like prima donnas drive people crazy for a variety of reasons one of the big ones is you don't appreciate how fortunate you are like in people love when people appreciate good fortune and appreciate a well-earned position and are you know engrossed in a beautiful life of something that they really enjoy and something that really inspires them why I need to I need to be right sized cuz I can easily fall into self-seeking and depression and self-pity and judgment and and all that stuff it's kind of a it's a bit of a default but I spend enough energy and if that had enough help over enough years to actually just say oh that's that's just awful destructive Behavior your entertaining in your hand yeah we watching we could all fall into those ruthlessly self-critical and it's hard for me sometimes it's very hard to step outside and in just just take a pause and recognize not everything's going to be right the first time you try it I think that a lot of people that are really great at things that's one of the things about them is that they're not very satisfied with their work like they're always looking to improve it there was looking for it to be better and then that can start that cycle in their hair self-loathing and anxiety and anger there that they're performing to their work or whatever it is that can lead to depression and I can lead to just tell hate and what are your tolerances like I'll be the first to tell you like the you know so do certain movies or moved in Tropic Thunder or one of the first do no Iron Man movies I was like I'd go over to the Monterey be like Play that back again in frame you got the line right your eye line was right the lighting was right the sensibility was right and you just look at it you go oh you know it's like I don't know for me it's like the playback of the perfect Superman punch KO and just go show me that again or when we were shooting Tropic Thunder I had a little teaser clip for Ironman but it wasn't coming out until the next year we were going to go to Comic-Con and I hope so she didn't show it to people in there like that movies going to do pretty good and then, can we talk but used to be like that with music too like I write music I haven't for some time but you would write something and then you just listen to it on the loop cuz you go wow that's not I know that I was here and I did that but it feels kind of inspired and you want to get on that stuff but important as long as it doesn't bleed out you and over the edges and just make it running again get out of your own way again I mean that's one of them many tenants of Life learn how to get out of your own way with everything included with creative Endeavors it seems like that that thing that you said about music most people who write things or creates things say that that it's you they know they're doing I'll give you make a great sculptor you know you're doing it but where is it coming from like what is what is the idea that fast itself into this perfect thing that you could step back and look at it and it seems to really how did I create that I don't know if I made my fingers move but I don't know if that's me who wrote that music who performed it I know you did but there's nothing inside you that sort of like Tunes in to this this energy of ideas and then it comes through you and again you kind of have to get out of your own way while you're writing something and then when it comes out it's weird feeling it's not like like if you hammer a nail into a board you f****** are very aware you did that you're very aware but there's something about the creative process that's not you're not totally there is weird yam it because it is you and it isn't you I love it oh I was out of my mind I was not in my mind it was a beautiful day and I think you saw the results poetic especially a countershot like they'll and something and they don't even have any idea they're going to do it and they did it and it is called The Knockout it's their training manifest itself in this one special beautiful moment work they they walk away and it's the work it's it's there's so many things involved either somebody moving pieces you have to be working on your own mind to learn how to get out of your own way you also have to be like really engrossed in whatever the activity is it you're doing like obsessed in love with it and passionate about it and then you have to have the discipline to show up and actually do the work there's so many different moving Pete and it all has to be mad it's not solid it's like a it's like a f****** wrapped on the ocean it's moving around unwrapped on the ocean it's moving around you're always trying to like figure out how to keep it keep it moving and functional and always seems unmanageable after it's over lies like that even work board</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> exchanges and I also know that I don't really know that much and it's different every time anyway but some I really like when you have a loose concept of what you're doing the certain parts that aren't going to change much and the rest you discover so the first Iron Man I mean John and I in there and the writers are John and I we we were just would write you right align all right align and then we would we were literally watching the puppies be born as we did it frustrating for people who knock when it's cuz she can look at a piece of paper and then go okay I got it and she's got it all memorized she's amazing but what's for the highest good sometimes it's very self-indulgent to come in and like you don't hand out new pages or so I'm not saying that Sophie me that mean I mean you need an environment of respect but I I like I like discovering things how much of acting managing those weird relationships how are these other people that you're acting with like you've made some references to like people changing other people's Alliance and ended up not being prepared I got out of acting for that very reason that was the thing that I I went from a world of stand-up comedy which are just a bunch of crazy people and two actors which are a bunch of crazy people but in a different way and the managing all the different characters and all the different personalities how hard is that well you sure can and it's like a thumbprint every time you're on a new project it's a completely different you know it's fingerprint the unit you never know what you're going to get and sometimes project seem blessed and sometimes you could say they're cursed but again might at Susan Downey Esquire was talking about this yesterday she goes it's the only thing you can't overcome as a creative producer on a big movie or anyting is in principle no matter what happens you can fix it we lost the light of the Thunder the weather came in okay he got sick so she's up she's pregnant okay great the change of costume you can't overcome personalities the relationships of people meet up before you commit to a role do you ever say like I want to meet Captain America I mean I love that you think I'd have the authority did you catch this guy already let me get a taste of Motel you thinking stick around IMO is always lets mind-meld let's get together let's work weekends let's spend time together cuz you can't replace that familiarity but so you have to try to build it and sometimes it happens very naturally like I adore Chris Evans I can't even why is that you the Boston guy he's technically and it's such a brilliant actor but he also doesn't take himself seriously he's flaky but he's the first guy you would want to have your back if something went down he's an end and yet were different enough where I feel like by being who we are and then both having those characters we were able to I think God I thought I thought Civil War was a special moment in the in the Arc of the Marvel films about turning one against the other in what and so sometimes you just get lucky as matter fact the whole Marvel Universe possibly without exception just happens to be a really well he call that when you put together something curated group of Souls films that happen to be about superheroes where is you know for the longest time superhero movies were bulshit you know he did TV shows were kind of clunky they were there were campy you know those Batman with the silly pants on and Robin had bought it everything was back and yet who was in the first Superman Brenda an attempt to legitimize something that was otherwise two-dimensional and then Batman in The Batman series three Hawks at least one two three not counting the TV show Mark Mark Ruffalo easy icing like how does that work like when you're on the set but that seems like one of the weirdest part about acting and some of those Avenger films is how much of it is actually digital yet you just couldn't get used to it I'll digress in a movie with Richard linklater called A Scanner Darkly and it was rotoscoped so I love that money love him and singing We would shoot the scenes and he was saying are you can just leave your your body mic on the outside cuz there's paint whole thing so that rotoscoping is a great metaphor for essentially what the Marvel movies became when sometimes you would even go and I'm supposed to come in and let you know throw something in the overs off camera but everything else was great. We'll just move your arm later and you go wow so you never want to rest on your laurels and say no but after turn while I was like why am I wearing this this this football suit just put some thoughts on my shoulders so I can move more freely and then be like right I got with it honestly what are you really using this all the stuff I'm working for you for reference I go great so I'll wear for one take and then I'll take it off and then I'll relax a little bit but then people would be like or Betten would be like I'm stuck in this f****** thing. in on the joys in the miseries of the of the technical challenge of doing an end speaking Ruffalo by the end because he's smart Hulk he literally they're just making big wherever he was and they put a little you know putting a piece of PVC with a big Hulk had up about five feet over where his head was and he was just there in a green suit so in a tracking suit would like its package out you know and he be like at least I like a little wrong around mice come on guys you know whatever you know and so I think Mark went about as far out into the ionosphere of fcg as you can I didn't get the whole smart smart Hulk thing how he figured that out wasn't really a genius scientist the beast but after so many times and against the genius of the people who break and Shake stories over there fighting his team's they go is not Hulk is Hulk it's a big battle always so conflicted what if he could meet himself in the middle and then what corner have we painted ourselves in by having a meet himself in the middle cuz then you can't every if that doesn't work you can't go back to the way it was you've done it for you can go back to the way it was so I just think that the Real Genius of the Marvel creative team as they end the Russo brothers who did the last few Avengers Infinity War endgame is a go we love writing ourselves into a corner we love it because then it it activates all of those how do we get out of purgatory juices and then you get the next right idea when you sit down you do they just lay it out and say this is this is the character Arc how do you how do you feel about this what do you think yeah an invite it's changed over time I think if you're one of the folks as their Standalone movies like Scarlett has Black Widow coming out I think you take a I would you take a bit of a different tack in how much meetings I think the phrase the legal phrase for actors in studios is Meaningful consultation not script approval because then anybody could have called the studio hostage cuz I don't approve this 30 million dollars that you're trying to spend right now so your schedule is fine when you say I don't approve I picture a bathrobe and a pictures Fine China and teacups that's why picture I don't approve and then just storming off I've Had My Moments to cuz I'm so passionate about story but again after Morsi time with the same people and new people coming in and and getting a a brutal education on what kind of process these movies require you to just start trusting more that they're thinking on your behalf and also little things are easy to change Big Things become a inconvenience to the higher good and at what point do you want to pull the air brake on something where the trains you know already leaving the state but I would imagine it would be a fine line that they say they want the actor be comfortable with the character and they want some and maybe some feedback would be beneficial but they're also they have a path division that they've created yet they would like to see you sometime or another at least more slightly to get on this path and by the way after I had my second round the kids with Susan I became both artists I had a bit of a Renaissance when I was doing the third Ironman and then after that to I was like what and I'm going to do this Avengers and it's so many moving parts and it's so difficult just to get all these schedules to come inside and get everyone together then I'm not to be like I'm not feeling it so again it's that thing it's it's sometimes where they say faster alone further together sometimes you can only think about further because you got to get downfield sometimes you're thinking hey this is my moment to Ron and I need I need a little help in a little approval and I need a little leeway but that's any creative Endeavor I would imagine when you were involved in something that's so epic when it's actually over it probably almost seems surreal cuz the production is so massive is so many moving pieces the so many special effects 20 things that you have to sort of visualize while you're doing it and then after it's all over you're done and what is it like the big Avengers movie how many months are you involved in this well I mean it could be some part of 18 months to two years depending on how far out you are and then four to six months of principal photography and then additional photography and then post and then I was include promotion you know from Yeah Yeah from Soup To Nuts the phrase Soup To Nuts one of my great great friends and probably one of the greatest big movie producers of all time we did the Sherlock's behind me did The Matrix series my missus was running his company for 10 years kisskissbangbang which is I think in some ways the best film I've ever done wind up being a calling card it came out and it that Bond and but Jon Favreau saw it and he said this guy could do an action to me and so that won't it be which is I think in some ways the best film I've ever done wind up being a calling card it came out in it that Bond and but Jon Favreau saw it and he said this guy could do an action movie and so that wound up being my calling card into that Marvel Universe</div>

Of time where I felt like I did I did the first Iron Man and then I went to Tropic Thunder and then I was doing the first Sherlock and they've my shirt off and itching all over the place and it just felt like I was that was hidden triples no matter what I did and he's confident as you seem and I was like I can't right now I am yeah in and I think this goes I mean this reminds me we were just talking about the McGregor cowboy fight coming up you know it's like it's going to go to that I'm going to watch it watch it you know two brilliant Souls who cannot lose neither one of them can afford to lose this fight wow. Is matchup want to lose but there's this guy who's the the poster child the guy who's the the one right the chosen one. Conor and this cowboy was like I think I can f*** that guy up the journeyman yeah so confidence you know there's been times when I felt I'm in possession of it and then you want to let go a little bit because it's only ever the moment and life guiding you the wind is so at your back door wow are you just are you just you know jumping over the waves and all that by yourself and you're like you bet I am but there's a physics to the moment man moment machine whatever and the winds at your back and then the windows what the f****** windows and it changes and your left there thinking what you know so I think it's great to be in full possession of what you would call Supreme confidence and then see what happens if you don't hold onto it so hard because it's great but it is a bit of an illusion cuz like everything else it's always changing and everyday the reset button the spacebar gets pressed and it's like now what the reset button the movie called the pickup artist with Molly Ringwald defacto producer of it uncredited and taught me a lot about just acting and what it was and he said he said what's your what's your action in this scene and I was like I'm picking up girls what's your action in this scene and I'm driving a car caught flat-footed you guys know your actions you're trying to go to work but you're getting distracted by this addiction you have to try to get laid so your action is your trying to get to work and you should always know what your action is because then when you come in in the morning confident or when you come in the morning to can't hit your ass with both hands you know what to do so it to me one of the great lessons I learned just boil down what it is you're doing whether there's a camera around or just what am I doing today today I'm showing up and I'm trying to be honest and and also to to listen and learn but really my action today is today is I'm beginning a processor promotion I think I remember watching that Madonna movie when he was dating Madonna Truth or Dare and he's hanging around with her or Warren Beatty just real real quick things I would ask him if so what was it like when Carly Simon write the song about you that's got to be a trip so many I mean we should we should do a whole session just about things I learned from Warren Beatty song about you that's got to be a trip so many I mean we should we should do a whole session just about things I learned from Warren Beatty</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> and honestly to clean the last 15 years when I started really taking martial arts seriously half the stuff that I've been able to do right in my creative life are principles that I learned on the mat with my Seafood you know guard your Center keep trying to leave to get to The Blind Side my started I think I'm in the 15th or 16th year Shifu is over day before yesterday so you know a bunch of times a week and if I'm working on something or if he can make it the location will have long stretches where were doing it everyday and the gradings so you got to prep for those you know it's which is a very underrated art form yes also so many Trade Secrets and so different than how I see it when I'm looking at videos and that in UFC everything is out in the open and it's disgusting you see in a lot of did the Eastern stuff there was a turf wars and we're not really going to show them are footwork we're not going to do this but anyway it's been a real deep dive Seafood Eric Oram who's Seafood my sweet gum was Grandmaster William Cheung Renown kind of Hong Kong rooftop fights all that stuff amazing lower but very technical difficult to build and easy-to-use remove junk he grabs wrist and comes over the top of the elbow she does straight Wing Chun he does it all the time and even practice is on a wooden dummy I got my ass kicked by a wooden dummy for about three years and then I finally understood the principle of don't bite force of force and you know it's just so anyway half the time if I would be in a crib artistic situation I would just say cuz Wing Chun problems are life problems life problems are Wing Chun problems and I would just go back to how did this kind of relate to cuz I don't like getting clocked and get my teeth knocked in because we tend to sometimes we glove up but we're not wearing mouthpieces it's very certainly not because he's very good at pulling his punches and he's also even better at making sure that I don't let me hit him but we get as close as we can to what the the real experience would be but again it's like everything I'm sure you know a few clicks back down the road there's things that instructors were doing that would be considered illegal to do to a group of students nowadays are so it was a normal thing you so did you start training for Sherlock Holmes or you start train before they didn't it absolutely coincided with my recovery and the two things just somehow or other seem to to lock in and talk to you off the Record and everything to do with my recovery as far as watching the dancers in apprentice and apprenticeship and it was an apprenticeship that was contingent on me being in a certain headspace what's a good substitute for negative addictions Bourdain training everyday and he was trained twice a day everyday so he went from when I first met him he was chubby he was smoking cigarettes you drank every night still kind of still drunk every night but you know he just did enough to have healthy things keep his body together and then his ex-wife got really into Jiu-Jitsu and then he decided to follow her one day to classes and he was kind of talking and laughing at it first and then became obsessed and then really got good I mean 81 in the tournament I mean oh my God what's really crazy is a picture of him walking down the street and I think they were in Rome and he has no shirt on and he's f****** repped Anthony Bourdain full six pack shopping up techniques and then you would roll take group classes to which is very very critical role of different people so he was in there like and it became a good thing for him to sort of become addicted to this positive thing yeah I mean for me if it was going to be golf it was going to be something passive like that I hear it's great but it's been it's just been a great gift and it's also the thing where you're just you're never done I'm a black belt five years welcome for another grading and now we're doing a lot of weapons stuff and it's just very young they said that it is a tool for developing a human potential and I never forgot that because it's really difficult to do I call martial arts are really really difficult to get your body to move that way and to be able to be effective in a conflict situation and if you can do any could do it over and over again and you can overcome that circle thing and you thought it was insurmountable and then you figured out how to do it eventually you get to this point you realize what everything in life is like that everything in life is like something that's a puzzle you have to figure out what am I approaching it wrong what what can I do to make it better how do I get more competent at this particular skill or this particular discipline and just the humility to I mean if I've noticed anything in the last couple years gingerbread man back in the 90s and I thought UFC it just start off and I was getting the VHS tapes and watching them and so when they go back on the 25 years ago I was like I've been I've been I've been there from jump that's awesome but we watch it's just that thing of no matter what you think the the tides are changing quickly and was a real wake-up call for a lot of martial artists was the UFC has a lot of the stuff that they were doing really wasn't effective they thought it would be if everybody was playing by the rules in the dojo and sort of following along though but once you really saw an actual cage event where people were just going balls-out you realize a lot of the stuff just doesn't work when I love how messy it was at the beginning matchups were actual cage event where people were just going balls-out realize a lot of the stuff just doesn't work when I love how messy it was at the beginning because it's telling matchups were Sophie almost laughable until you until you saw the violence and no weight classes</div>

		<div class="heading">Transcription: </div>
		<div class="paragraph"> that thing you wear around your neck yes being as you are obviously known as being Iron Man are you concerned with wearing a large thing in the exact same spot as though life is funny cuz I was doing this before I ever got fitted for the party so it was more of art imitating Oddball stuff I was doing anyway obviously had that in the comic books Loosely prearranged Destiny and what's incredible is how far afield you can go from it and still find your way back with the whole superheroes reboots and there's so many like how many f****** Spider-Man's have been how many hawks are there been only one Iron Man though you got that goes far what year is it I hear you're Iron Man man on a roll and if anybody else try to be Iron Man we bloody well interesting ly enough East coaster a dad of of some Renown very different my dad was a kind of a underground filmmaker alter Maverick I grew up definitely being Bob Downey seniors kid spend time in Long Island which is I think we're Tony was raised but when when Stanley was really thinking that through she it was the Vietnam era and he was thinking about the military industrial complex he was thinking about how about if I can throw a little bit of not politics in here but karma and he gets trapped no by the own thing and it becomes you know so and that course it was the whole demon in the bottle I think first superhero who ever like had that you know almost like that Jersey cuz he was hammered so I mean the ad that was obviously but I again once something goes your way you can draw all the parallels you want you can call it Destiny but it was it was something that I definitely definitely felt drawn to and I definitely fought for and looking back on I got the part because it turned out to be a pretty special thing inside in a very strange way I mean it's inexorable this point you you know which is why I thought it was cool that you're going to do Doctor Dolittle because I love the fact I like I'm a fan of your work done a lot of great stuff like what and you doing Doctor Dolittle is like a cool yourself seriously but I'm not you know I mean that's a great break because like if your Iron Man like there certain people that for whatever reason become a role and that is it that's what we will accept you are that guy and you're not doing that you're you're you're able to see through your talent and through your ability to take chances you're able to be a bunch of different things as well as be the Iron Man yeah I mean I don't know if I'm noticing I think now it's that it's that we need to shift and we need new challenges and just like anime and society and politics things are moving and more thing in the information age is making things so everything's learning and growing from everything so quickly and then it been proving or disproving or or discounting whatever's happening next but for me I heard that this was on the table my mrs. who's my creator partner in all things instead of Steve gagan I was like that's a big turn for him and we live on a farm we have alpacas and goats and Cooney Cooney pigs and it's just crazy and I was like okay same way I did with Ironman all right there's something here and then before I signed on I was you doing like weirdest Welch doctor I just want to think of I don't want to just do another English accent so there's this guy William price who's a Nutty Welsh doctors in the old rudest he was supposed to believe like we could communicate with all that stuff so I sent a picture of wild looking guy wearing like a superstars on it and like a staff in his hand that looks right to me it's always it you know what I mean it's always that thing of you click and you go here's my here's my sense what are you thinking and then the other the gallery guy says yeah let's lean into that and then go back to this and that anyway you give me some of this and he go yeah and all the sudden you're in a Synergy so I could good interview like a good fight like a good dinner it just kind of crazy look to me yeah to me I just thought that's can do little be like Daddy goes to see have to be that way the whole way through a go know when they find him he's a recluse and then the animals like clean them up and then he looks Less on handsomer where would you live less weird for the kids for the rest of the movie but let's find him like that</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> is the daughter Ironman totally closed cuz I don't believe it is you guys can go through time now you can go there's do you know you're ready open up that door let me ask you the question if I pick the Jersey back up and put it on wouldn't you feel a little bit like a crap they go through a few semi lackluster Avengers movies without you ready for this where the world's fate is at stake realized they need a super genius and then they figure out how to restart that time machine, is that the audience sees you when you when you step out of that thing is this your income you want a little Ark on it too cuz if this is your idea then you got to show up for it to I'll do it I'll show up to do I don't know we all have to do whatever do that digital thing I'll do it the way people would freak out if you came back. Of time and I was talking to Colin Jost last night who got to sit next to him at the Golden Globes and who was there and you know on the show and with him when he hosted recently I go it's just incredible our culture never encourages taking a break never encourages saying don't chase that thing because you've got it in your hands and and and I love the idea that if you are if you're good at what you do then it's not about time it's about it doesn't matter when you decide to pick up the mantle again it's just about but it's scary isn't it could you imagine like just don't you to show for four years and then come back and do it again you be like in a lifetime who knows he was arguably the greatest of his era and just stopped to stop for 30 years and no one does that no one who's that good and then when you see him some did he receive some reward it was on a panel you do end up sitting in front of Podium Rider brother and he was talking about Bill Cosby and he's doing his routine about them taking away Bill Cosby's Awards and all of us, he do it tomorrow if you could just get up there tomorrow and he be f****** murdering yes and but it would be different different human stuff that he did in the past now it makes me cringe in your can't believe he was that person when he did Delirious I think he was like 22 or something crazy like that anyway lately in relation to a bunch of things but also just that particularly nowadays giving yourself permission to not have to jump cuz you know this strike the iron all that stuff abused and maybe it's just as a bit of an anxiety to the times which I remember to speaking of past Generations I remember grown-up 1974 Nixon's black and white TV getting impeached my dad and his buddies are whooping it up but they're still pissed and I'm going like wow it's it's not worse or or or better it's different but now it's on us so there's urgency question to me starting up again is off the table I feel I've done all I could with that character there would have to be a super compelling argument and a series of events that that made it obvious to it but the other thing is more than what's going on in Washington Thompson talked about that when he was running for sheriff in Aspen he was talking about how local politics like your neighborhood either consumed with it and it becomes a thing they're cheering for the rooting against in and then you know what your your life revolves on something that you have very little power over teams turf wars we moved to Colorado to Rocky Mountain Way he wants told me no speak out of school he said you should just watch TV you have you probably have a really rock solid idea of what's going on his was more trying to have enough things going on that I wouldn't have any ideas for a year and then I give myself a break for you also known as a rock to it it's like they were kicking down doors and light it on fire was different it was an edge to it you know he's he added crazy he had a crazy to this beautiful Harmony and I love it when the guys that added crazy go up to the thin veil between dimensions and say I think I'm going to stay put and then all of a sudden they represent stability they were being okay hanging up your guns yeah I'm just being you know everyone has to accept that at some point in time Riley maybe that's you and your glasses right if does everyone have to accept that at one point time to going to have to get off the ride but when you're doing great and you're kicking it like boxers or a perfect example they always last too long it's only been a small handful like Andre Ward recently Marvelous Marvin Hagler prime it just go that's it I'm done and they actually are done almost every one of them comes back and almost everyone who chases that Dragon hears when I love you you're making an argument for and also the argument against me coming back and doing another I just imagine the moment wherever he goes f****** crazy would be amazing I would love that but I would also love you hanging it up yeah it's 2020 and I'm not an OCD guy but I keep thinking she clearly see clearly and if your vision is going and it's difficult because I feel like we all just get buffeted by feelings and ego or fear the word little you know of resentments or intuitions that are tied to something maybe higher but you think is out of your reach or whatever so give it a perfect time and I got to go have dinner with a bunch of the Marvel folks last night and kind of just a little bit of extra closure cuz you know the movie came out and bananas and the directors are sending me pictures of like people flipping out in theaters when Tony snaps and I was like like a really big cultural thing but then like Victoria Alonso who's the head of the effects are all these movies a literal super-genius or Kevin feige or Favre or Scarlet or some people that I've just been there with it for a long time we we we were there experiencing it all when it came out and then we see each other on the red carpet and it's not intimate and then we kind of haven't really had a chance just to do nothing just hang out and you know have some crude Italian contacts yet so it was really interesting being here today cuz yesterday was this kind of last night was this kind of real-life told like closing the circle on things a bit that's got to be bitter sweet but I liked it that you want to move on and I like that you want them like that you're doing something like Doctor Dolittle cuz that's like you've done a lot of wild s*** in your life you have a lot of while s******* your career but Eucerin body every new chapter with the same kind of energy all those a different result a different piece of art it's all the same you that's one of the more interesting things about people in a particular actors get to be a bunch of different things and it's one of the weirdest things about that craft like when you see you know a guy who's like Daniel Day-Lewis embodies these different humans like literally becomes different humans it's but it's always Daniel Day-Lewis I mean like even though he plays these these with you know that there will be blood guy and all these different Psychopaths and various fascinating characters it's always the energy like you're so your pump to see him do it I think that's the I feel the same way with you like I know there's you're an interesting guys a lot of s*** going on in your head so when you dive into something whatever it is whether it's your character from Tropic Thunder or whatever it is like your dive into something whatever it is whether it's your character from Tropic Thunder or whatever it is like you or you're going to it's going to be Robert Downey jr. diving into something so I would imagine it would be kind of annoying even though you are brilliant at Ironman to stay Ironman</div>

		<div class="paragraph"> nothing to you bro I forward phone the first white person I'm going to keep trying to keep this like I v I got to bring the Welsh flag in in Wales it was but a long time ago on the first watch black Kodak go to bring you a red dragon no no no how much even my food will trust record in Walking the entire length of the Yangtze river in China to the third longest river in the world the longest to run through a single nation 4000 miles is it to 352 days and it's from the Tibetan plateau in the west of China I took an 5150 2 days end up near the ignition High pulls out into the East China Sea you know what I thought when I heard that you did this I thought to things want to talk this guy's insane like what what kind of willpower does it take to walk and Hike 4000 plus miles but the other kind of validates a lot of the ideas that people have always had about human beings migrating from Africa and through Siberia do the Bering Strait like you can do that what you did what you did is not dissimilar world record imagine you're doing it because you're trying to stay alive and keep your family alive yet yet I tell you what yeah we would have had all this so much so much history in June he's not my kind of Taken it was actually discovered in 2009 the true and scientific Source really yeah that gives us we have to do two over two years of planning so is a case of work and heavily in China finding out whether they said never been done before 8 to we have to get different teams involved globally and then we discovered that I was always I was always preparing to go from the traditional source which is most famous food for the soul given to the planning that I should does a true and scientific tools found by the same guy who mapped the traditional Source yet he pointed it would NASA use the technology was able to correct this wrong it's like you don't give a traditional source which means it's a little bit more sensitive so it was tough to go from from the true and scientific tools for sure but it's a longer distance you've got to do it yeah I agree with you I'm glad you think that way but obviously a person is willing to walk 4000 miles would think that way you wouldn't what happens with the end as well so come to Shanghai there's an official point of where the Yangtze poisons is trying to see another like you know you only have to go to this this point I might know I'm walking to where the land ends salon storm akima so is one of the biggest storms I've had in the past 30 years and not put me into hide and you not to shelter up after everything that I faced over 350 days in a couple days before I crossed into the East China Sea before finish but at that point it's almost I visualized the completion over and over again in my head I played it so many times what it would be like what it feel like it's everything to cross the finish line. Almost not day hop into my dick cross the finish line I almost over visualized I want to get to that I want to get to those but I want to I want to ask you when you decide to plan this trip yet so how much to have you learn from the first two crazy trips that you had and how did you calculate like how much food you're going to need where you going to meet Nick pit stops when you going to be able to acknowledge you do it so with that we're always looking for communities on Long route Community Food and so and actually about to the traditional if we went from the traditional we go maybe one week 1 and 1/2 weeks without coming across and locals so we have to carry a weekend off with Russian personal backpack but that's true and scientific source and his back think it was two or three weeks we couldn't find any Community along the way by satellite and by the people that we were there on my Logistics managers that I know it needs to carry raises way to try to visit people you tracking through a forest yet and then try to get food out say I'm going to way to maximize and as well so it's saying okay past 3 weeks so let's carry food for 3 and 1/2 of 4 weeks. Communities now empty abandoned them without food what what are you caring for food I would carry a Russian tax so the Russian pipes were pretty good we had like chicken tikka masala spaghetti bolognese and are you using our car these dehydrated yeah that was her so just pulled in there about 15 minutes she's craving all of this big-time I know how your body knows what you need stripped of all the all the protein in your body currently have any I think if you fool you're craving ice cream you know before you wanted to say but I think a few now the point of not starvation if you really hungry and you know what's good what's not good I think your body gives a good tale sign if we can the last months of mission Yangtze I was really bad I was coming across cities everyday cuz you can imagine like to watch Shanghai I'm so I was just craving protein I was craving fats and what the times but last month I was just eating really unhealthy scanning starchy foods with protein you know that was fast food chains on the way KFC scream.
